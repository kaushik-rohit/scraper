2018-09-01,PM: Second Brexit vote would betray democracy,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902001527/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45385421,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPrime Minister Theresa May says she will not ""give in"" to those calling for a second referendum on Brexit.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, she says such a move would be a ""betrayal of democracy"" - and of the trust of the people who voted to leave the EU.The People's Vote, a cross-party group including some MPs, is calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal.Mrs May also says the government is preparing for no deal but is confident of leaving the EU with a ""good deal"".The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March and the government had previously ruled out another referendum.She writes in the newspaper: ""In the summer of 2016, millions came out to have their say. ""In many cases for the first time in decades, they trusted that their vote would count; that after years of feeling ignored by politics, their voices would be heard. ""To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy - and a betrayal of that trust.""The People's Vote campaign launched earlier this year and has a number of high-profile backers, including Sir Patrick Stewart and Gary Lineker. It has also secured funding from donors including Julian Dunkerton, co-founder of fashion label Superdry - who has given  the largest donation of Â£1m to the group. Thousands of supporters also took part in a march in central London in June. The campaign is hoping to get enough MPs, including the Labour leadership, to back a call for a referendum on the deal Mrs May strikes with Brussels - which is due to be put to a vote in Parliament in October.Earlier this week, it was revealed in a leaked memo that People's Vote wants Labour MPs and activists to submit a motion at the party's conference this month, committing Labour to backing a new referendum on the final deal. The party's current policy position is to respect the result of the 2016 Brexit referendum.The prime minister says the coming months are ""critical in shaping the future of our country"" but that she is ""clear"" about her mission in fulfilling ""the democratic decision of the British people"". She said that following the Chequers agreement in July, ""real progress"" had been made in Brexit negotiations. While there is more negotiating to be done, Mrs May says ""we want to leave with a good deal and we are confident we can reach one"". The government has been preparing for a no-deal scenario, even though this would create ""real challenges for both the UK and the EU"" in some sectors, Mrs May says. But she adds: ""We would get through it and go on to thrive."" She says that she ""will not be pushed into accepting compromises on the Chequers proposals that are not in our national interest"". "
2018-09-01,McDonnell 'worried' about Labour split,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902001527/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45382486,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowShadow chancellor John McDonnell has revealed he is ""worried and saddened"" about the prospect of the Labour Party splitting over the anti-Semitism row.Mr McDonnell told the New Statesman he wanted to avoid a split ""at all costs"" and was happy to talk to unhappy MPs.The party has been at war with itself over the issue throughout the summer. Earlier, former Home Secretary Lord Blunkett called for ""seismic change"" after veteran MP Frank Field resigned the whip in protest at the leadership.Mr Field's resignation followed a summer of stories about anti-Semitism and the Labour Party. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was criticised for his presence at a wreath-laying ceremony in Tunisia in 2014, which was said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich terror attack.Later, footage emerged from 2013 of Mr Corbyn saying a group of British Zionists had ""no sense of English irony"".Former chief rabbi Lord Sacks branded his comments as ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech.He accused Mr Corbyn of being an ""anti-Semite"" - with the Labour leader saying he was ""more careful"" with language now.In the New Statesman interview, Mr McDonnell said: ""I think there are people who are willing to leave the party"".""I don't understand why there is this sort of pre-emptive move to split off,"" he went on.""So I'm worried and I'm saddened by that and I think that open door is always there to prevent that happening, because any split is automatically damaging.""He continued: ""I lost a debate for 30 years, and I stayed within the party.""If you're having people like the SDP [who split from Labour in the 1980s] standing in particular constituencies, it takes votes away from Labour.""So the issue for me is I'd want to avoid at all costs a split if we can.""Writing in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday, Lord Blunkett urged a rethink of the ""so-called Corbyn project"" and called on the party to abandon ""the recent return to bullying and thuggery experienced in the 1980s"".He told the party to ""belatedly get its act together"" and ""demonstrate the leadership qualities which have been lacking"".Mr Field quit the Labour group at Westminster over what he called the party's ""tolerance"" of anti-Semitism and a ""culture of nastiness"". But Mr McDonnell said: ""My view is this. I want it resolved quickly. ""I think we can come out of it as the anti-racist party that we are tackling the real issues. ""I don't want to live in a society where synagogues are attacked, or where Jews graveyards daubed with swastikas or worse, Jewish children having to have security at their schools.""But he stopped short of calling for Labour to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance guidelines on anti-Semitism, the magazine said."
2018-09-01,Labour needs seismic change - Blunkett,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902001527/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45381117,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFormer Labour home secretary Lord Blunkett has said the resignation of veteran MP Frank Field must be seen as a ""catalyst for seismic change"". Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Lord Blunkett called for a rethink of the ""so-called Corbyn project"".Mr Field quit the Labour group at Westminster over the party's handling of anti-Semitism allegations and what he called a ""culture of nastiness"". His critics say he quit because he was facing deselection by local members.Lord Blunkett said Mr Field's decision indicated a ""deeper malaise"" within the party.He wrote: ""The commitment to Labour as a 'broad church', which motivated some of those who nominated Jeremy [Corbyn], has been thrown back in their faces and demonstrated that the so-called 'new style of politics' is anything but.""He added that Labour must put its ""own house in order as decisively and speedily as possible"". ""Either Jeremy Corbyn can lead a party into gradual decline and irrelevance, or demonstrate that he can lead a party fit for government. The choice is his."" Mr Field, MP for Birkenhead for almost 40 years, resigned the Labour whip on Thursday, blaming a ""culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation"" in local Labour parties.He told the BBC it was ""sad"" how the party had been taken over by the hard left since Mr Corbyn's election.""The campaign that Jewish people feel against them by factions of the Labour Party is all part of the intolerance which we also see at a local level,"" he added.Mr Field, a former minister for welfare reform, said he wanted to remain a party member and sit as an ""independent Labour"" MP.But Labour said resigning the whip meant quitting the party.Mr Field later told the Press Association he would legally challenge any move to remove him from the party, adding that the saga was ""one of the saddest"" in his long career.Mr Field, who won his Merseyside seat in 2017 with a majority of 25,514, said he was considering whether to stand down as an MP to trigger a by-election, in which he would stand against an official Labour candidate. His critics say Mr Field quit because he was facing deselection by local members.He recently lost a vote of confidence organised by members angry at his support for the government in Brexit votes.A Labour source said: ""Frank has been looking for an excuse to resign for some time.""The party's deputy leader Tom Watson described Mr Field's resignation as a ""serious loss to the party"" and a ""major wake up call"".Earlier this month, Mr Corbyn apologised again for hurt caused to Jewish people by anti-Semitism in his party and admitted Labour had been too slow in dealing with disciplinary cases."
2018-09-01,Brexit progress but no Irish breakthrough,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902001527/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45363827,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBoth sides in Brexit talks say progress is being made but without any breakthrough on the crucial issue of the Irish border.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said he was ""stubbornly optimistic"" about getting a deal after talks in Brussels.Unresolved issues include intellectual property, data protection and the role of the European Court of Justice. EU negotiator Michel Barnier said he needed detail from the UK on its plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland.He told journalists that remaining ""bones of contention"" between the two sides were being steadily eliminated with particular progress on issues of security, judicial and defence co-operation after ""long"" talks on Friday.The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.Both sides are hoping to agree a divorce deal and a statement on future trading relations at a summit of EU leaders on 17 October, although Mr Raab said that deadline could be missed slightly.  He told reporters: ""We're committed to resolving the deal by (the October council) and ultimately on my side I am stubbornly optimistic that a deal is within our reach.""Mr Barnier said there was a ""measure of flexibility"" and if the process slipped by a ""few days or weeks"" it would still be possible for the UK to leave the EU with a deal, if approved by the UK and EU Parliaments, on schedule.The EU negotiator said the ""building blocks"" of an agreement were falling into place. He repeated his offer of an ""unprecedented"" future partnership with the UK but insisted this depended on an ""orderly"" withdrawal and settling key outstanding issues. He said the question of the Irish border had come down to ""minutiae"" and he needed to see the detail of how the UK proposed to manage cross-border trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the event of there being no other solution - the so-called backstop - would work in practice.""This backstop is critical,"" he said. ""It is essential to concluding the negotiations. Without a backstop, there will be no agreement."" Mr Raab said he had used Friday's talks to explain in more detail the UK's proposal for its future relationship with the EU, the so-called Chequers plan agreed by Theresa May at her country residence in July. The PM's blueprint, which would see the UK follow EU rules on trade in goods, is unpopular with many Tory MPs, with leading Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson calling for it to be ditched. Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July in protest over the PM's proposals, said he agreed with Mrs May's former aide Nick Timothy, who urged her to ditch the plan.Mr Timothy wrote on Thursday that she would have to make further concessions to get EU backing for it and this would be unacceptable.  And Stuart Jackson, the former Tory MP who until recently was an aide to Dominic Raab's predecessor David Davis, said the Chequers plan ""has not really got any friends"" on either side.""For the EU, it's outside their core principles and undermines the integrity of the single market,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""In the UK, people believe it is Brexit in name only.""The two sides say they have agreed 80% of the withdrawal agreement. The remaining 20% includes:Mr Raab vowed to increase the frequency of talks with Mr Barnier when he took over the job.But Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, a supporter of the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the outcome of the negotiations, said ""nothing had changed"" since then.""Dominic Raab may say he is more confident about reaching agreement but he can offer nothing concrete,"" he said. ""He knows the EU27 are not buying the Chequers car crash - a proposal designed around the need to hold a fractured government together and not on the economic interest and well-being of either the UK or the EU."""
2018-09-01,Abusive tweets to MPs 'more than double',https://web.archive.org//web/20180902001527/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45363720,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe number of abusive tweets about politicians more than doubled between 2015 and 2017, according to analysis of more than one million tweets.Twitter insults targeting politicians rose from about 10,000 during the 2015 general election to just under 25,000 in the snap election two years later.The best-known politicians got a lot of tweets and abuse - but less well-known MPs got proportionally more abuse.Sheffield University's computer science department carried out the research.Project leader Kalina Bontcheva said the increase in abuse towards public figures was ""shocking"". The study suggests both the volume and proportion of Twitter abuse increased between the two elections. The research showed abusive tweets made up:Abusive tweets to Ed Miliband dropped from 5.6% when he was Labour leader in 2015 to 3.3% when he returned to the back benches.Nearly 600 of the UK's 650 MPs have a Twitter account, which they use to promote their work in their constituencies, show their support for local causes and engage in debate.But MPs have been warning for several years that the level of abuse they receive has got out of control, with female MPs in particular being targeted, and threats of violence becoming common.In July, the Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said colleagues were being advised to ""close down"" their accounts by Parliament's Health and Wellbeing Service. Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott has spoken about the offensive sexist and racist messages and ""mindless abuse"" she and her staff had to endure every day on social media, not just at election time. Labour's Paula Sheriff has said the 2017 election had been the ""most brutal"" to date.On Thursday, Labour MP Stephen Doughty tweeted an example of an abusive tweet he had reported - and Twitter's response that it did not violate its policies.He said: ""If you wonder why Facebook, Twitter etc are increasingly becoming difficult places, here's another example of abuse we get and the response of the social media companies - who think we deserve a different threshold of abuse 'to allow discourse'.""Responding to the research, Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said: ""It is vital that we prevent the rising intimidation of people in public office and those who want to stand for election.""That is why this government is consulting on new measures that will protect candidates and campaigners standing for public service. We can't let intimidation of people in public life continue unchecked.""Last year a report by the Committee on Standards in Public Life said an ""intensely hostile online environment"" had been created and warned people would be put off from entering politics because of the abuse."
2018-09-01,Man jailed for plot to kill Theresa May,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902001527/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45373487,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA man who plotted to kill the prime minister in a suicide attack has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 30 years.Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman, 21, from north London, was convicted last month of preparing acts of terrorism.Rahman had planned to detonate a bomb at the gates of Downing Street and then kill Theresa May with a knife or gun.Sentencing him, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said Rahman ""would have carried out his attack"" had he not been arrested.Rahman was captured by an undercover operation involving the Metropolitan Police, MI5 and FBI.He was arrested moments after collecting a bag and jacket from an undercover operative that he believed had been fitted with explosives.The judge said: ""I am sure that at all material times Rahman believed the devices to be real and capable of causing serious harm.""He added that the undercover officers involved in the case were ""scrupulous"" at all times and Rahman was the ""instigator and author"" of his own actions. By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic CascianiRahman made contact with IS recruiters via social media - but unbeknown to him the contact was actually an FBI agent. That agent referred Rahman to an MI5 team of online role players who convinced him that they were genuine IS figures.""I want to do a suicide bomb on Parliament,"" Rahman told the MI5 role players. ""I want to attempt to kill Theresa May. All I need now is a sleeper cell to lay low for now.""Read more from Dominic CascianiRahman, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said, had been ""told and believed"" that the rucksack bomb given to him was ""capable of causing casualties on a scale comparable to those caused at the Manchester Arena"", where 22 people were killed.Rahman's lawyer argued he had been brainwashed by his uncle - who was later killed in a drone strike while fighting for the Islamic State group in Syria - and said his client had not intended to go through with the plot. But a probation report read to the court by the judge revealed that Rahman had admitted in prison he would have carried out the attack had he been able to.A pre-sentence report described him as a ""clever and cunning"" young man who had the potential to ""operate below the radar to dreadful effect"".Mr Justice Haddon-Cave told Rahman he would have ""plenty of time"" to study the Koran in prison, adding that Islam was ""a religion of peace"".The judge added that Rahman - originally from Birmingham - was a ""very dangerous individual"" and it was hard to predict if he will ever be de-radicalised. During his Old Bailey trial, Rahman pleaded guilty to a separate charge of engaging in conduct which assisted the preparation of terrorist acts, which related to a ""sponsorship"" video he filmed for an associate who allegedly wanted to join IS in Libya.In addition to the life sentence, Rahman was handed six years in prison for the IS sponsorship video. The sentences will run concurrently, rather than consecutively."

Peter Mond, fourth Baron Melchett, went from Eton to Cambridge University, where he read law.Illness prevented him taking his finals but he later took an MA in criminology at the University of Keele, followed by 18 months at the London School of Economics.Lord Melchett inherited his title aged 25, following the early death of his father.He became a Labour Party Whip, a junior minister at the Department of the Environment and a minister of state for Northern Ireland under Jim Callaghan.He became executive director of Greenpeace UK in 1989 and in 1999, he and 27 fellow activists faced criminal damage charges after ripping up genetically modified crops but were acquitted when the jury accepted their defence that they believed the crop would have polluted the environment.In 1985, he tried to cut through the perimeter wire of an American air base at Sculthorpe in East Anglia as part of an anti-nuclear protest. Speaking to Sue Lawley on Desert Island Discs in 2000 he said you had to have the public with you to bring about change.""You only win a campaign if people support you and people will only support you if you're right - if what you're saying is correct or if what you predict turns out to be the case,"" he said.Executive director of Greenpeace UK, John Sauven, said he would be ""sorely missed by everyone who loved wildlife and wanted to protect the global environment"".""In Peter's 12 years campaigning at Greenpeace he was both fearless in taking on big corporations like BP and Monsanto but also pioneering in supporting solutions like Greenfreeze refrigeration to save the ozone layer.""We all live a little bit more peacefully with the earth and its animals as a result of his efforts. A true radical and campaigner to the end.""Helen Browning, chief executive officer of the Soil Association, where Lord Melchett had been for 18 years, said the organisation was ""so saddened"" by his death.""[He] was such an important, charismatic figure in the environment and organic movement throughout his lifetime,"" she said.Ms Buchannan, a non-executive board member at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said: ""He was an extraordinary person but he had such credibility because he was actually farming himself in Norfolk so he wasn't' just pontificating, he was doing and he was proving how you can farm in a different way.""He held these views and did these things while at all times being a true gentleman... gentle and kind while also being brave and passionate."

David Challenor, 50, who was jailed for 22 years for child sex offences, had been the agent for Aimee Challenor at the 2017 general election.She has been suspended from the party on a no-fault basis while an investigation takes place.The party said it would release its findings once that was complete.Earlier this week Ms Challenor, 20, who was the Greens' equalities spokeswoman, pulled out of the race to be the party's deputy leader, following her father's conviction. Challenor, of Charterhouse Road, Coventry, was found guilty at Warwick Crown Court of 20 offences including sexual assault, taking indecent photographs of a child, rape of a girl aged 10 and false imprisonment, and jailed last week.The court heard he held a 10-year-old girl captive in his attic and photographed the abuse as it was carried out. His crimes came to light after the girl confided in someone and it was reported to the police, who interviewed her towards the end of 2015.Challenor was charged in November 2016, West Midlands Police said.Ms Challenor said she would be working with the inquiry and thanked those who have offered her support.She added: ""I am saddened to see circumstances have forced me away from the Greens at a crucial point for our party, though I remain fully committed to our shared Green values of environmental and social justice. ""I hope that the investigation is able to run efficiently, so that we can all move forward together.""In a statement, the Green Party said: ""An investigation will be conducted by an external agency into the circumstances and disclosures surrounding Aimee's father being able to act as her election agent while facing charges for serious sexual assault against a minor.""It said the suspension had been made following a number of complaints and would remain in place until a review at the next meeting of the Green Party Regional Council.Following Challenor's conviction, the party apologised and terminated his membership as soon as the information came to light. Following the suspension, Clare Lorraine Phipps, acting chair and secretary of Green Party Women, said: ""We will be standing by Aimee throughout her no-fault suspension and closely following the investigation to ensure that difficult lessons are indeed learnt by the party."""

Mr Salmond, who strongly denies the allegations against him, quit the SNP on Wednesday evening.The former first minister is taking court action against the Scottish government over its handling of the complaints.Mr Salmond also launched a crowdfunding appeal to pay his legal costs, which surpassed its Â£50,000 target in a few hours but has been heavily criticised by opposition parties.He has said he intends to apply to rejoin the SNP once he has had an opportunity to clear his name. Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland on Thursday that the situation as a whole was ""incredibly difficult"" for her and the party she has led since Mr Salmond stood down in the wake of the 2014 independence referendum.But she said women had to be confident that their complaints would be ""treated seriously and fairly - and by fairly I mean fairly to all parties concerned"". Ms Sturgeon also said she wanted a culture where people are able to come forward with complaints regardless of ""how senior, how powerful, how well known or what the political allegiance is"" of the person involved. She added: ""Whatever any of us do and say in the context of this very high profile case, we must absolutely make sure we don't make it harder for or discourage women from coming forward in the future. I think that is an obligation on all of us right now.""Ms Sturgeon, who has described Mr Salmond as being her ""friend and mentor"" for the past 30 years, also urged people to wait for the legal process to conclude rather than creating ""some kind of media circus"".End of Youtube post  by Alex SalmondMr Salmond, who was Scottish first minister from 2007 to 2014, released a video on social media on Wednesday evening announcing his resignation from the SNP but has not been available for interview.He said he was quitting because he wanted to avoid potential divisions within the party, which has faced calls to suspend him.It follows allegations, which emerged last week, from two Scottish government staff members about Mr Salmond's behaviour when he was first minister. He has described the allegations, which are now being examined by Police Scotland, as ""patently ridiculous"".In his statement, Mr Salmond said: ""I did not come into politics to facilitate opposition attacks on the SNP and, with parliament returning next week, I have tendered my resignation to remove this line of opposition attack.""Most of all, I am conscious that if the party felt forced into suspending me it would cause substantial internal division.""The Scottish Conservatives said Mr Salmond's crowdfunding appeal was ""astonishing"" as it meant Scotland ""now faces the incredible and unprecedented situation of its most famous former first minister appealing to SNP supporters for cash to take legal action against the government he used to run.""Scottish Labour MSP Rhoda Grant claimed Mr Salmond was ""sending a signal to those who have made the allegations that he has the upper hand"" and accused him of ""dragging Scotland into the gutter"". Labour's former first minister, Jack McConnell, is among those who have urged people to instead donate to charities which help victims of sexual assault and harassment.Ms Sturgeon, who retweeted funding appeals for Rape Crisis and Women's Aid on Thursday morning, said the crowdfunding appeal was a matter for Mr Salmond, who she said was ""perfectly entitled to take his own decisions at this stage"". The Daily Record newspaper broke the news of the sexual misconduct allegations last Thursday. The paper says it has seen wording of one complaint which describes an incident alleged to have taken place at the first minister's official residence in Edinburgh, Bute House, in the first week of December 2013. The two women lodged complaints in January this year, just weeks after the Scottish government adopted a new complaints procedure in the light of wider concern about sexual harassment at Holyrood and Westminster.Does this resolve all the issues for the party? Of course it doesn't. There is an atmosphere of despair, a demeanour of despondency, around Team Sturgeon as they view the impact upon the party - it's a political problem for the SNP - and the cause of independence, which Mr Salmond believes he is partly ameliorating by stepping down while his court case is heard.But there are problems within government as well. It was Nicola Sturgeon who instigated the review of internal sexual conduct procedures within the Scottish government, the consequence of which would appear to be that a couple of complaints were raised in January following that review.It is personal for Nicola Sturgeon as well, as she acknowledges in the statement she issued last night - Alex Salmond has been her friend and mentor for 30 years. Mr Salmond claims that the subsequent investigation into the allegations against him by senior Scottish government civil servants was ""unfair and unjust"" - something Ms Sturgeon strongly denies. He said he had been given no opportunity to ""see and therefore to properly challenge the case against me"" and that he had ""not been allowed to see the evidence"".Mr Salmond has also claimed that someone within the Scottish government has ""flagrantly and repeatedly"" breached the confidential complaints process by leaking details to the Daily Record.In an article in the Times newspaper, the head of the FDA civil service trade union criticised Mr Salmond for singling out the Scottish government's most senior civil servant, Leslie Evans, for criticism.In his original statement about the allegations last week, Mr Salmond said the permanent secretary had, ""for whatever reason"" decided to ""mount a process against me using an unlawful procedure which she herself introduced"". Ms Evans has since become the target of online abuse and conspiracy theories. She was last year tasked by Ms Sturgeon with reviewing new procedures for dealing with harassment allegations against current and former government ministers.A new procedure was introduced with the blessing of Ms Sturgeon in December - but Mr Salmond has previously described it as the ""Leslie Evans procedure"".FDA general secretary Dave Penman said: ""If you want to give it a name, it is the Nicola Sturgeon procedure. It is owned by the Scottish government and, as Ms Sturgeon herself made clear, she agreed it in 2017. ""Mr Salmond's decision to attack the integrity of Scotland's most senior civil servant is no accident. He would be aware that his supporters would jump on this bandwagon.""Mr Penman also said that, as a former first minister, Mr Salmond ""knows that Ms Evans is duty-bound to investigate complaints""."

It will also assist efforts to identify potential victims and access data from tech firms to catch offenders.Mrs May is the first British prime minister since Margaret Thatcher in 1988 to visit the country.She is meeting president Uhuru Kenyatta and seeing British soldiers who are training troops from Kenya and other African countries fighting Islamist militant group al-Shabab in Somalia.At a joint press conference, the prime minister announced a wide-ranging new security pact between the two countries, including funding for enhanced airport security in the former British colony. The UK also offered support to Kenyan police in dealing with violence against girls and women, plus legal expertise on pursuing complex terror and organised crime cases. The cyber centre project is linked to Kenya's existing anti-human trafficking and child protection unit, which was set up in 2016 with input from the UK's National Crime Agency.This unit has helped protect around 499 children since March 2016 and helped secure convictions of British paedophiles who have sexually abused children in Kenya.""Online child exploitation is an abhorrent crime and we are determined to ensure there is no place to hide for predators who use the internet to share images of abuse across borders, too often with impunity,"" Mrs May said ahead of her arrival in the Kenyan capital.The prime minister is on the final leg of a three-country tour, which has seen her visit South Africa and Nigeria in an effort to maximise trade opportunities after the UK leaves the EU next year.BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said there was no talk of a ""no-deal Brexit"" at the press conference - and that President Kenyatta had said he wanted continuity and guarantees that tariff-free access to the UK would continue.Mr May stressed that the UK was ""committed to a smooth transition that ensures continuing in our trading relationship with Kenya"" and that ""duty-free, quota-free"" access to British markets would continue.""We are pursuing, of course, a good deal for trade with the EU once we have left the EU. But we will be looking to enhance our trade relationships around the rest of the world as well.""She also pledged that any assets acquired from corruption in Kenya and hidden in the UK, would be sent back: ""Today we signed an agreement to ensure that any proceeds of corruption that end up in the UK will be given back to the people of Kenya.""She has announced Â£4bn of extra financial support for African economies, linked to a refocusing of the UK's aid spending, while promising support to Nigeria to confront violent Islamist extremism and human trafficking. She also said she wanted the UK to overtake the US to become the G7's biggest investor in Africa by 2022 and struck Britain's first post-Brexit trade pact with Mozambique and the Southern African Customs Union.Mrs May's trip finishes on Thursday with a state dinner hosted by Mr Kenyatta.He has told the BBC's Hardtalk programme that all public servants, including himself, will be audited to show the origin of their wealth.By BBC Africa business editor Larry MadowoKenya re-exports some of its products to the EU through the UK and there are concerns that a hard Brexit might jeopardise that.Kenya's trade split between the UK and the rest of the EU ""is almost 50-50 and the country will have to strike a good deal with both the UK and the EU because it depends on both markets to sell its tea, fresh produce and other agricultural products,"" says economist Tony Watima.Kenya supplies more roses to the European Union than any other country and is the world's third largest exporter of cut flowers.The country sends 17% of its flowers sold in the EU to the UK. With 500,000 people supported by the flower industry, according to the Kenya Flower Council, every market is critical.But with direct flights from Nairobi to New York beginning in October, the country may be looking to tap into the larger US market for its goods.Read more"

Mother-of-four Siobhan McLaughlin, from County Antrim, lived with her partner for 23 years but never married, which meant she was not able to claim the benefit when he died. The UK's Supreme Court ruled this was incompatible with human rights law. The ruling puts pressure on ministers to change the rules, potentially benefiting thousands of families.   A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said it would consider the court's ruling carefully but said the ruling did not change the current eligibility rules for receiving bereavement benefits, which are paid only to people who are married or in a civil partnership.The Supreme Court cannot change the law but it puts pressure on the UK's legislatures to change the law and ensure that it is human rights compliant.Ms McLaughlin, 46, lived with her partner John Adams, who died in 2014, and they had four children together.She is now the sole provider for her family and works two jobs as a special needs classroom assistant and cleaner. Ms McLaughlin said the money provided by the WPA would have been useful to her family. Reacting to the news on Thursday, Ms McLaughlin described the judgment as ""just surreal"".""It is just fantastic for all those children that have been recognised now,"" she said.""It wasn't ever about me, it was always to do with the parent's allowance part of it.""When asked what it meant for people ""in her position"", Ms McLaughlin replied: ""Hopefully they will recognise that they are just as worthy as children born into wedlock.""Laura Banks, Ms McLaughlin's solicitor, told the BBC that the decision will benefit ""thousands of children throughout the UK"".""What Siobhan has said from day one is that it's unfair and it's wrong that her children should be treated any different than children whose parents are married,"" Ms Banks said. ""The Supreme Court have upheld that - it has actually said that not only is it unfair but it's unlawful.""She said the government will now be asked to act quickly ""so as many people can benefit from this as possible"".The Child Bereavement Network estimated that every year, more than 2,000 families face the ""double hit of one parent dying, and the other parent realising that they and the children aren't eligible for bereavement benefits"".To be eligible for Widowed Parent's Allowance under the current law:Alison Penny, director of the Childhood Bereavement Network, said the organisation was ""delighted"" with the judgement. ""We pay tribute to Siobhan for having the courage to bring this test case and improve the situation for thousands of grieving children and their surviving parents"", Ms Penny said, in a joint statement issued by the Network, the Child Poverty Action Group and the National Children's Bureau. ""While she brought her case in Northern Ireland, it has implications for the rest of the UK where the wording of the eligibility criteria is the same.""BBC News Legal Correspondent, Clive ColemanThe WPA can only be claimed by a surviving partner if that partner was either married to, or in a civil partnership with the deceased.  The question at the heart of this case was whether that restriction unjustifiably discriminates against the surviving partner and/or their children, and breaches their human rights.The Supreme Court has decided that it does, and that has significant implications.  There are some 3.3 million co-habiting couples in the UK.  Around 1.2 million of them have children.  The purpose of the WPA is to help the children.  Thursday's ruling will benefit those families where one co-habiting parent has died and the WPA has been refused, or where a parent dies in future and the surviving partner makes a claim.  The Supreme Court cannot change the law but by saying that it is incompatible with the Human Rights Act, it is putting pressure on the UK's legislatures to change the law and ensure that it is human rights compliant. After Mr Adams' death, the County Antrim woman challenged the rule that parents must have married to be entitled to a widowed parent's allowance.Ms McLaughlin, from Armoy, won the original case but it was overturned by the Court of Appeal.In April 2018 the Supreme Court sat in Northern Ireland for the first time ever.Ms McLaughlin's case was the first case heard by the court in Northern Ireland."

But can it be done in a way that satisfies everybody?As Frank Field resigned the Labour whip on Thursday, the inner core of Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) - the ""officers' group""- was preparing to meet to draw up the agenda for what could be a stormy gathering of the full NEC next Tuesday. That meeting is set to become the forum for deciding the party's position on tackling anti-Semitism.In July, Labour adopted a new code of conduct for its MPs and other elected representatives. The new code incorporated the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition of anti-Semitism, which has been adopted by many public bodies in the UK and around the world since it was agreed in 2016.But crucially, say critics of the Labour leadership's stance on this issue, it did not reproduce four of the 11 ""contemporary examples"" of anti-Semitism in public life, cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) as guiding its work.Labour sources maintained that most of the excluded examples were covered by the new code, but had simply been reworded to give them disciplinary force.For instance, the IHRA says that ""Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis"" is an example of anti-Semitism. Labour's code says members should ""resist"" using Hitler or Nazi metaphors and that ""such language carries a strong risk of being prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party"".There was an outcry that not every example had been adopted, not just from some Jewish groups but from many Labour MPs too.The Parliamentary Labour Party - its MPs - is due to be balloted on adopting the complete IHRA document, including all the examples, on 5 September, the day after the NEC meets. While open to further amendments to the new code of conduct, there is one IHRA example of anti-Semitism in particular which Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have been reluctant to adopt: ""Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, eg, by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.""They say this would especially restrict the free speech of Palestinians - and the ability to discuss the circumstances around the foundation of the state of Israel.But with Unite's Len McCluskey and Jon Lansman of Momentum (who are usually allies of the Labour leader) now willing to adopt the IHRA examples in full, the Left is not solidly behind the initial position taken by their party leader.It also means there is now a majority on the NEC for full adoption of the IHRA document.Opponents of Jeremy Corbyn will portray this as a setback, and question why he didn't adopt the IHRA's examples earlier.But his supporters are likely to argue that he hasn't been defeated, as at July's NEC meeting it was agreed to continue to consult on Labour's code and that the party has simply changed tack in light of the consultations.Will this detoxify the issue? Well, that may depend on what accompanies the adoption of the IHRA examples.Back in July, the pro-Palestinian MP Richard Burden suggested at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party that it does indeed adopt the IHRA definition and examples in full - but that this, in his words, should be ""IHRA plus"" - the ""plus"" being a statement making clear that criticism of the Israeli government would still be legitimate.He suggested that the party take a similar tack to the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, which held an inquiry into anti-Semitism in 2016.It recommended the adoption of the IHRA definition and examples by all political parties, but with the following addendum:""It is not anti-Semitic to criticise the government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent. It is not anti-Semitic to hold the Israeli government to the same standards as other liberal democracies, or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government's policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent.""It is possible the NEC will take this approach.But there are suggestions that more wide-ranging caveats could be added - effectively neutralising the effect of adopting the ""racist endeavour"" example of anti-Semitism.It is possible the IHRA examples sit alongside Labour's code of conduct rather than be formally integrated.And the NEC may make clear that the adoption of the IHRA examples would not lead to the retrospective disciplining of party members.Some Jewish groups which have been outspoken in their criticism of the Labour leadership would be far from satisfied with this outcome.Euan Philipps, from Labour Against Anti-Semitism, has got his retaliation in first.""For the Labour Party to claim that it has re-adopted the IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism then the party would need to ensure that the definition has a functional place within the organisation's disciplinary process,"" he said in a statement.""If it is watered down by caveats and addendums then the party cannot claim that it has been fully adopted. It is a false compromise.""So some caveats could severely weaken the IHRA antidote to this toxic political issue. But there is another possible, if unlikely, outcome next week.Labour sources say there is a ""three-month rule"" at the NEC, which means the party's ruling body cannot return to exactly the same subject for further debate during this period.I'm told at least some of those who oppose adopting all the IHRA examples are considering invoking this - trying to defer the whole issue until the Labour conference in late September. That, of course, would mean that an anti-Semitism row would almost certainly overshadow that event.It's hard to believe that the leadership would welcome this. Some NEC members tell me that as anti-Semitism will now formally be on the agenda it is inconceivable that it won't be discussed.Nonetheless, there could be a procedural wrangle next week before anything of substance is debated. A demonstration is being planned by the Camden Momentum group - which takes a quite different view from Momentum's founder and NEC member Jon Lansman - outside next week's meeting, highlighting differences on the Left over this issue.It doesn't want the NEC to endorse the full IHRA document - and wants any decision to be taken by Labour's rank and file members. Last week the Camden group passed the following motion:""The members elected Jeremy Corbyn. The IHRA definition would return the party to the right which we voted down by a large majority - twice. Therefore, the members, not the NEC, nor the PLP, must decide whether or not to adopt the IHRA examples. WE DEMAND THAT THE DECISION BE PUT TO A VOTE OF ALL LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS'.""Also on the NEC agenda is a discussion of Labour's long-running Democracy Review. Rule changes arising from this review - for example, a further reduction in MPs' influence in nominating future leadership contenders - will be put to next month's Labour conference.But what isn't in the Democracy Review document could be more controversial than what is. The review hasn't called for the mandatory reselection of MPs.But some local constituency parties have been proposing rule changes to the way MPs and parliamentary candidates are selected - and it's likely these will be debated at Labour's conference.They are calling for ""open selections"" - in other words sitting MPs could be challenged by other party members between each scheduled general election. And it's possible that they could get the backing of the influential left-wing Momentum group for this controversial change.Momentum's current position is to reform the existing system of selecting candidates - where MPs aren't automatically challenged.But if Momentum decides to back open selections following a meeting of its leadership on Saturday, it's more likely the Labour conference will do likewise.I'm told there is strong grassroots pressure to do so.The influential Unite union's official policy is also to support the mandatory reselection of MPs.Labour former deputy leader Lord Hattersley has already warned that this could provoke a split.And very senior and current figures in the party are privately warning that while there may not be a huge split, the party could splinter - with a handful of MPs initially sitting as independents in protest.As politicians return to Westminster next week, Jeremy Corbyn will face the twin challenges of how to hold his party together and how to reach a consensus on tackling anti-Semitism."
2018-09-01,No Labour breakaway,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902001527/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45367473,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEvery avalanche, it is said, starts with a single pebble, and in Westminster terms, Frank Field is a pretty hefty pebble. The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee is one of Parliament's lone wolves - austere and relentless in a series of policy battles stretching back across the decades. On the committee corridor at the Palace of Westminster, he is a formidable figure who has savaged the bosses of Carillion and BHS, been a thorn in the side of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, and, if your memory stretches back across the decades, the scourge of the Maxwell brothers. So is his departure from the Labour whip the beginning of the much predicted split in the party?  Not by design, anyway. Mr Field's departure looks very much like a personal decision. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect for Labour is that he has got unhappy MPs (and there are plenty of them) thinking about their own futures. There are several factors in play.First, if the government does manage to get its plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 through Parliament - and the final proposed boundaries are expected to be published next week - then something close to a general reselection exercise may follow. That provides Jeremy Corbyn's supporters with an opportunity to remove those who don't support their leader. Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) and the party conference will have to approve a set of rules to deal with that eventuality, and the details of those rules, and the level of protection they afford to sitting MPs will be studied very closely by those who fear they are under threat. If the rules look like the vehicle for a purge, there will be trouble ahead, and some Labour MPs will calculate they have nothing to lose. There are also wider concerns about a more general revamp of party structures proposed by the former MP and close Corbyn ally Katy Clark, which would entrench the left's organisational grip. Then there's Brexit. Some of Mr Corbyn's most vocal internal critics are those who believe Labour should now be campaigning for a second referendum.They will be loath to upset the applecart while there is a chance of getting organised, cohesive Labour backing behind a Commons vote which could achieve that - and they will be looking to the forthcoming party conference to see if party policy will change, perhaps on the back of union votes. It follows that they may rethink their position if that vote doesn't materialise and the UK leaves the EU. On the other side of the coin, the four Labour MPs, Frank Field included, who voted with the government and saved it from defeat in a crucial Brexit vote in the Commons in July, have also taken considerable flak; but there are significant electoral dangers in Labour purging its Brexiteers - remember that the seats Labour lost in 2017 were mostly in Leave-voting areas. More dangerous and immediate is the anti-Semitism issue which has dogged Labour through the summer. Crucial votes on Labour's approach to it take place in the National Executive Committee next week, and then the Parliamentary Labour Party, which might defuse, or detonate the whole issue. It is hard to understate the level of fury on both sides of this row, which is why it could easily run out of control. Words have already been spoken which make it hard to imagine the protagonists kissing and making up - but a serious attempt to discipline MPs like Margaret Hodge or Ian Austin, the most vocal critics of Mr Corbyn on this issue, could trigger a walkout by their supporters.What is harder to see is how these different strands of dissent could gel into a coherent breakaway. Take Mr Field. He is not part of any Labour tribe, and he certainly does not fit neatly into the vocal group of Blairite holdouts who are Mr Corbyn's loudest critics. For a start, reflecting his Birkenhead constituency, he's a Brexiteer, so any idea that he's about to line up with Labour's hardcore Remainers at some grand launch ceremony for a new party is a non-starter. And this illustrates a wider point; there are plenty of Labour MPs who don't like Mr Corbyn, but they don't necessarily agree on much else. To work, a new party would have to be more than a lifeboat for shipwrecked careers. It would need a unifying idea under which a critical mass of activists, as well as MPs, could gather (political parties need infantry as well as generals) and it would certainly need to attract people from beyond the Labour Party.That would require devising policies which might attract Tory dissidents like Anna Soubry, as well as Labour figures like Chris Leslie or Chuka Umunna.  And such a party would also require leaders, and here there's another problem - if the 1980s SDP is the model, the possible MP defectors include plenty of Bill Rogers types, but no Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams or David Owen - big, recognisable popular figures.  My guess is the biggest threat to Labour unity is that the case of Mr Field raises the temperature and the pot starts to boil; that deselection threats escalate and that more and more MPs consider their positions.Close Corbyn ally Chris Williamson spent the summer pushing for local parties with MPs who are leadership opponents to deselect their incumbents and choose someone more congenial. Until now, many MPs uncomfortable with the Corbyn leadership have bided their time, but if they sense a real threat to their personal positions - and if the party that nurtured them seems to be changing out of recognition - then the bets may be off. Political parties are held together by more than ideology - for their members they can be a family tradition and a way of life, providing friendships and social life. Those links are hard to break, but there is a sense that for many Labour MPs and members, they are fraying. And across the party divide, the Conservatives, who are developing reselection rumbles and talk of purges of their own, are watching with a combination of opportunism and fear.   "
2018-09-01,Salmond allegation,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902001527/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-45295578,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTwo people have made sexual harassment complaints against Scotland's former first minister Alex Salmond. The complaints, which he denies, relate to his time in office. Why have they come to light now? In November, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #Metoo movement, there were concerns over reports that women at all levels in the Scottish Parliament had experienced harassment.At the same time, MPs at Westminster were accused of intimidating or propositioning young women inappropriately. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for an internal review to be carried out of the Scottish government's procedures for handling complaints in the workplace.As part of that review, a new procedure on handling harassment complaints involving current or former ministers was introduced.Two complaints in relation to Mr Salmond were made in January of this year.According to the Daily Record, they relate to events in 2013 when he was first minister.Scotland's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, informed Mr Salmond on Wednesday 22 August that she was considering the public interest in making the fact of the complaints and investigation publicly known.Mr Salmond, who was Scottish first minister from 2007 to 2014 and oversaw the independence referendum, instigated legal action aimed at preventing the Scottish government revealing details of its investigation but later dropped those proceedings.The next evening, Mr Salmond put out a statement denying claims of harassment and saying he was launching a court action to contest the Scottish government's complaints process.The details of the claims of sexual harassment and who made them have not been officially released.The Scottish government's permanent secretary, Ms Evans, would only confirm that two complaints of sexual harassment had been made against Mr Salmond.The Scottish government insisted the investigation had been ""entirely confidential"".However, the Daily Record, which broke the story on Thursday 23 August, later claimed to have seen the wording of an allegation by a Scottish government staff member.It says she alleges Mr Salmond touched her bottom and breasts through her clothing while she was alone with him at at the first minister's official residence, Bute House, in December 2013.Police Scotland has confirmed that it is ""carrying out an assessment of information which we have received and inquiries are at an early stage"".Mr Salmond has strongly denied any claims of harassment or criminality.He also accused someone in the Scottish government of ""sustained leaking"" of the ""most unfair kind"".He said it was ""crucial"" to find out who in government was responsible.The former first minister was told in March this year that allegations had been made against him and he had been assured that the process would be confidential.He claims he has still not been allowed to see the evidence against him.His statement called the procedure ""unjust"" and said he had not been able to properly challenge the case against him.Mr Salmond said the procedure, put into operation by Ms Evans three years after he left office, was ""grossly unfair"" and would lead to prejudicial outcomes.On Wednesday 29 August, Mr Salmond lodged a petition with the Court of Session in Edinburgh seeking a Judicial Review.It will decide the issue of the lawfulness of the procedure.The court will now seek a response from the Scottish government. It is likely to be some weeks before there is a hearing before a judge.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she became aware in April that Mr Salmond was being investigated.In fact, it was Mr Salmond himself that told her.She said she had no prior knowledge of complaints being made against him.Ms Sturgeon said she had taken ""no role in the process"" and not spoken about it publicly because she did not want to compromise the internal investigation.She said the fact that complaints were made could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.""Mr Salmond announced on Wednesday 29 August he was resigning from the SNP.The ex-first minister said he intended to apply to rejoin the party once he had an opportunity to clear his name.He said he was quitting because he wanted to avoid potential divisions within the party, which has faced calls to suspend him.A Judicial Review will consider whether a proper ""decision-making process"" was followed by the Scottish government.It will not look at whether or not the ""correct"" decision was made.  The court will seek to ensure that principles of natural justice and fairness have been followed.Before the review can be heard Mr Salmond must appeal to the Court of Session for permission to proceed.  Permission will only be granted where the Judicial Review has ""a real prospect of success"".  His petition was formally lodged with the court earlier this week, and the Scottish government will now have an opportunity to respond."

The European Union's critics sometimes invoke the presence of tariffs - effectively taxes on imported items - on African goods when they accuse it of being a protectionist club or racket. So how much is there to this?  The relatively simple element is the EU's arrangement for a group of nations known as Least Developed Countries (LDCs.) Of these LDCs, there are currently 33 in Africa - most of the countries on the continent. These ""are low-income countries confronting severe structural impediments to sustainable development"". These countries have duty-free access for their goods to the EU under an initiative known as Everything but Arms (EBA). The same access is also given to Equatorial Guinea, which used to be an LDC country.If it's not a weapon or ammunition, and it is made or grown in one of the countries concerned, it has duty-free access to the EU. If the product is from Ethiopia, Uganda or Malawi, for example, there would be no tariffs. There may be other barriers - such as regulations, product standards and customs documents to complete - but that also applies to goods from other countries outside Europe's single market, including the US, Japan and Canada. None of the three countries the prime minister is visiting - South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya - are on that United Nations list of LDCs. That is probably one of the reasons she chose them. They are bigger economic players and there is more to be gained from commercial relations with them. But all three of them do get some degree of relief from EU trade tariffs. There is an arrangement that covers other developing countries beyond the LDCs. It's known as the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).  Other rich countries, including the US and Japan operate their own GSPs. The EU's version applies to Nigeria and has benefited Kenya but does not cover South Africa. It doesn't open the tariff-free gates as wide as EBA does. The EU says it gives tariff-free access for 57% of products and reduced rates for most of the rest. But the minority of goods still subject to full tariffs are often farm produce. Both the Everything but Arms and the Generalised System of Preferences are unilateral. The EU simply lowers or eliminates tariffs and the partner country is under no obligation to reciprocate and cut their own tariffs on imports from the EU.But there are wider deals known as Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA). These go further and also mean a country like Kenya opening its market to the EU, though not as much as the EU does. Kenya is part of an EPA through an East African regional group. Kenya has duty-free access on an interim basis until three other countries in the group sign and ratify it so the agreement comes into full effect. South Africa, together with five other countries, has another partnership. The EU says it gives fully or partly duty-free access to 98.7% of imports coming from South Africa.  So there are tariffs that affect some South African goods. And it can get very complicated. For many types of agricultural products there are quotas at zero tariffs. For others there are reduced tariffs on a certain quota and higher duties on quantities above that. Some tariffs vary seasonally - oranges have higher tariffs when the EU crop is available. There are tariffs imposed on specific products from some African countries. Atiku Abubakar, a former vice-president of Nigeria writing in the Daily Express, was concerned about his own country.  Mr Abubakar wrote that refined sugar from Nigeria faces a tariff of more than 300% if it's exported to the EU. The EU tariff on imports of refined white sugar - not covered by any preferential arrangement or a reduced duty quota - is 419 euros per tonne. That probably would apply to sugar from Nigeria as it does not have an EPA and is not eligible for the EU's scheme for the least developed countries.  It is certainly true that the EU's tariffs on sugar are seen as high, although they are nowhere near as high as 300%.But there is another point about the EU's tariffs. Countries that don't face EU tariffs often welcome them being applied to other countries. Dr Peter Holmes of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at Sussex University points out some African sugar producers take that view. Without the tariff they would struggle to compete against the giant of the industry, Brazil.  When Mr Abubakar writes that ""if Nigeria and other African countries could export agricultural products tariff-free to Britain"", the fact is that most of them already can. Moreover Nigeria could get improved access to the EU if it accepted an EPA agreement negotiated with the EU and a group of West African nations. But President Buhari decided not to sign it, saying he wanted to protect the industries that provide jobs for Nigerians. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

Speaking to me in an interview in Singapore, where he has been touting UK trade opportunities to Asian governments and businesses, Mr Fox says that things have changed since he made that assessment. He said there appeared to have been ""an increasing engagement"" by European capitals in recent weeks, and that while he can't be ""scientific"" about the odds of a no-deal scenario - that it feels like there's an increased focus to get an agreement. His comments come as the UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said that ""no-deal wouldn't be the end of the world"".Dr Fox reiterated that the government does want a deal with Europe - but that if there is no deal ""it wouldn't be the fault of the UK government, it would be the fault of its European partners"".The negotiations over what kind of deal the UK will have with the EU have been closely watched out here in Asia, not just by governments who the UK is courting for future trade deals, but also by British businesses based out here. The uncertainty surrounding the process and the dire projections highlighted again by the UK Chancellor Philip Hammond last week about what a no-deal could do to the UK economy are some of the biggest concerns for British businesses based in the region.But while he acknowledged there would be some disruption to the UK economy in the event of a no-deal, he dismissed the estimates by the chancellor, saying they were ""rather hard to swallow"". Dr Fox also said however that if there were ""impediments to trade and investment"" that appear in Europe during this process, it would send a signal to the rest of the world's investors ""about how open Europe is to business"".The nature of the negotiations have meant that the UK cannot sign any trade deals with other countries whilst it is going through this process. But Dr Fox has come up with a new trade strategy post Brexit - saying the UK can be a 21st century exporting power.What that means in reality is harder to gauge. British businesses have told me that while the ambitions are grand - it's not clear how the government plans to implement these plans, especially across Asia where there is a lack of human infrastructure in the UK's trade department to build key relationships and lobby governments on behalf of British business. Still, Dr Fox is clocking up the air miles. He was in China before Singapore, and is due to visit Brunei next. He signed an agreement to sell more dairy to the Chinese market. The UK has been courting China with the hopes of signing a deal with Beijing post-Brexit. But when I asked him whether the UK would be willing to compromise on intellectual property agreements to get more access to the Chinese market - he said the UK wouldn't give up its ""crown jewels"".

2018-09-01,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902001527/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to Â£40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-01,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902001527/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

""Our own ecosystem has grown over decades,"" he said. ""You can not play with it by picking pieces.""While he has previously expressed criticism about Mrs May's Chequers plan, sources close to Mr Barnier told the BBC he has not been this explicit before.In response, the UK government insisted its plans were ""precise and pragmatic"" and would work for the UK and the EU.The negotiations between the UK and the EU have an informal October deadline, but Mr Barnier said this could be extended to mid-November. In an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr Barnier said Mrs May's plans ""would be the end of the single market and the European project"".""The British have a choice,"" he said. ""They could stay in the single market, like Norway, which is also not a member of the EU - but they would then have to take over all the associated rules and contributions to European solidarity. It is your choice.""But if we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences. ""Then all sorts of other third countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits.""Please upgrade your browserHe said another problem was that many goods now come with services attached - meaning they were hard to separate in a trade deal.""We have a coherent market for goods, services, capital and people - our own ecosystem that has grown over decades,"" he said.""You can not play with it by picking pieces. There is another reason why I strongly oppose the British proposal. ""There are services in every product. In your mobile phone, for example, it is 20 to 40 percent of the total value.""Mr Barnier's comments were published on the same day Mrs May wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that she was ""confident"" a ""good deal"" could be reached. But she said it was right for the government to prepare for a no-deal scenario - even though this would create ""real challenges for both the UK and the EU"" in some sectors. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned a no-deal Brexit would be a ""big mistake for Europe"", although Britain ""would survive and prosper"". Various business groups have warned about the possible impact on the UK of no-deal Brexit. The World Trade Organization - under whose rules the EU and UK would trade if no deal was agreed - said it ""would not be end of the world... but it's not going to be a walk in the park"".Responding to Mr Barnier's remarks, a government spokeswoman said: ""We are confident that we have put forward a proposal that is precise, pragmatic and that will work for the UK and the EU.""This proposal achieves a new balance of rights and obligations that fulfils our joint ambition to establish a deep and special partnership once the UK has left the EU while preserving the constitutional integrity of the UK. There is no other proposal that does that.""Our negotiating teams have upped the intensity, and we continue to move at pace to reach - as Mr Barnier says - an ambitious partnership, which will work in the mutual interests of citizens and businesses in the UK and in the EU.""The so-called Chequers plan was agreed at the prime minister's country residence in July. It led to the resignations of Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.Mr Barnier has previously criticised the proposals, ruling out allowing the UK to collect customs duties on behalf of the EU. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work."
2018-09-02,Labour can 'end anti-Semitism row quickly',https://web.archive.org//web/20180902200535/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45388447,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour can resolve its anti-Semitism crisis quickly, John McDonnell has said, insisting Jeremy Corbyn's views on Israel have been ""misinterpreted"".The shadow chancellor told the BBC that the party should accept in full the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance guidelines on anti-Semitism, as long as free speech was protected.But ex-Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks said Mr Corbyn must also ""repent and recant"".And ex-PM Gordon Brown said Labour must act now or undermine its values.Speaking at a meeting of Jewish Labour MPs in London, Mr Brown said the party needed to be ""cleansed of anti-Semitism and racism"". The party has been beset by arguments over the issue throughout the summer, prompting ex-minister Frank Field to resign the whip on Thursday and others to threaten to do the same. John Woodcock also cited it as one of the reasons for quitting the party in July. Claims that the leadership is failing to tackle anti-Semitism and, in some cases, condoning it came to a head last month when footage from 2013 emerged of Mr Corbyn saying a group of British Zionists had ""no sense of English irony"" despite a lifetime in the country. Labour MP Luciana Berger said it made her ""feel unwelcome"" in the party while Lord Sacks branded his comments as ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since the late Conservative MP Enoch Powell's 1968 Rivers of Blood speech.Speaking publicly for the first time since he made those remarks, the former chief rabbi told the Andrew Marr show he stood by his criticism of Mr Corbyn and suggested British Jews were considering leaving the country because of the prospect of him becoming prime minister.""Jeremy Corbyn must repent and recant as quickly as possible,"" he said.""When people hear the kind of language that's been coming out of Labour, that's been brought to the surface among Jeremy Corbyn's earlier speeches, they cannot but feel an existential threat.""I'm afraid that until he expresses clear remorse for what he said and what his party has done to its Jewish sympathisers, as well as its Jewish MPs, then he is as great a danger as Enoch Powell was.""Anyone who uses the term 'Zionist' loosely without great care is in danger of engulfing Britain in the kind of flames of hatred that have reappeared throughout Europe and is massively irresponsible.""But Mr McDonnell said that while Lord Sacks had been ""brutally honest"", he was wide of the mark, because Mr Corbyn had never solely blamed Israel for the conflict in the Middle East and had consciously distinguished between Zionists and the Jewish population in general.""I just say to Lord Sacks 'you've got it wrong, come and talk to us',"" he said. ""You've misinterpreted what's gone on. I think you've got, really have misinterpreted Jeremy. I've known him for over 30 years. His whole life has been devoted to anti-racism, to peace and justice.""He said the decision on whether to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance guidelines in full, to be discussed on Tuesday, was a matter for Labour's ruling body but he suggested he backed it personally.He claimed a solution was within reach that could ""satisfy all sides"" if Labour promised ""full engagement"" with the Jewish community going forward but members were able to continue to criticise the actions of the Israeli government within clear boundaries and the rights of Palestinians were also recognised.""I think we can resolve this fairly quickly, constructively and with good will, working together,"" he said.Speaking at a meeting of the Jewish Labour Movement, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the definition must be adopted ""unanimously, unequivocally and immediately"".Warning about the rise in anti-Semitic attacks in recent years, he said the problem was not ""abstract and theoretical but real and present and had to be dealt with now"". Labour, he said, had historically often been the ""last line of defence against persecution and discrimination"" in society and the party could not allow itself to be seen as the ""first line of attack"". ""It is not simply about a procedure. It is about who we are, what we stand for, what makes us tick and the soul of the Labour Party,"" he said. On 26 May, in Bucharest, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance adopted the following non-legally binding working definition of anti-Semitism: ""Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. ""Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.""The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said Labour's NEC was likely to adopt the definition but with caveats amid concerns about the stifling of ""legitimate criticism"" of Israel. Former MP Ivor Caplin, who is chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said it and other groups were only prepared to have a dialogue with Mr Corbyn if he made it ""very clear"" that he would take firm action against anti-Semites in the party and others engaging in ""bad behaviour"" at a local level. Amid growing warnings that Labour was facing a 1980s-style split, Mr McDonnell said the party must remain a ""broad church"" and he hoped Mr Field would ""come back into the fold"". The Birkenhead MP, a former welfare minister, quit the Labour group at Westminster on Thursday over what he called the party's ""tolerance"" of anti-Semitism and a ""culture of nastiness"". While Labour MPs who resigned the whip should normally trigger a by-election, Mr McDonnell said in this case he did not want to ""go anywhere near that"" given Mr Field's long service to the party. "
2018-09-02,Fox rejects Hammond's Brexit warning,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902200535/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45388557,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowInternational Trade Secretary Liam Fox has refused to back Chancellor Philip Hammond's warning that a ""no-deal"" Brexit could damage the economy.Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, he said: ""This idea that we can predict what our borrowing would be 15 years in advance is just a bit hard to swallow.""Treasury analysis estimates that by 2033 borrowing would be around Â£80bn a year higher under a ""no-deal"" scenario.It also forecasts no deal could mean a 7.7% hit to GDP over the next 15 years.Asked by Andrew Marr whether he accepted the figures, Mr Fox said: ""Can you think back in all your time in politics where the Treasury have made predictions that were correct 15 years out. I can't.""They didn't predict the financial crisis. No-one could.""Pressed on whether he agreed with the chancellor, Mr Fox said: ""I don't believe that it's possible to have a 15-year time horizon on predictions of GDP.""""So the answer's no,"" said Marr.Divisions have deepened within the party in recent months as Brexiteers accuse Mr Hammond - who is seen to be pushing for a softer version of Brexit - of embarking on ""another instalment of dodgy project fear"".Meanwhile, there is growing pressure on the prime minister to win support for her Brexit plan, known as the Chequers agreement.The plan would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to maintain friction-less trade at the border.But critics say it will leave the UK tied to EU rules and prevent Britain from striking its own trade deals in years to come.In his interview, Mr Fox said he was behind the Chequers plan and and could not imagine many things worse than remaining in the EU.By Susana Mendonca, BBC political correspondentThe prime minister may be promising to stand firm on no second referendum but that is not stopping opponents in her own party from gearing up to take down her Chequers plan for Brexit. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox - who's stayed inside the PM's camp - has warned that there's no point in trying to unseat Theresa May because ""changing the leader doesn't change the party arithmetic"". While David Davis, who resigned over Chequers, has suggested that the prime minister limited his influence over the negotiation process. He said while he was the Brexit secretary, whether he ""controlled events"" was ""another matter"". Mr Davis has never been one to shy away from making his views known and now that he is on the outside of the tent - he will join the chorus of Brexiteers doing exactly that, as Mrs May heads into the final stretch before she does or does not get a deal on Brexit.In an article for the Sunday Telegraph, Theresa May has insisted she would not be forced into watering down her Brexit plan during negotiations with the EU.The PM wrote that she would ""not be pushed"" into compromises that were not in the ""national interest"".But David Davis, the former Brexit secretary who resigned over the Chequers agreement, said the caveat - ""except in the national interest"" - was an ""incredible open sesame to all"".Also interviewed on the Marr show, he admitted he would vote against Mrs May's plan in any Commons vote, saying it would be ""almost worse"" than staying in the EU.Another Conservative MP, Nick Boles - a former minister who backed Remain - said the Chequers policy had ""failed"" and he could no longer support it.Also writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he said the EU was treating the plan as ""an opening bid"", and the UK was facing ""the humiliation of a deal dictated by Brussels"".In his interview, David Davis said concerns over maintaining a soft border between Northern Ireland border and the Republic had been ""heavily overemphasised"" in the past.""This is a much more straightforward issue to deal with if we choose to, if we put the political will behind it, we and the Irish Republic, the two together,"" he said.However he said he did agree with Mrs May that a second referendum should not take place.In her article, she said it would be a ""gross betrayal of our democracy and... trust"" to ""give in"" to those calling for another vote.Her objection to it comes as a movement pressing for another referendum - the People's Vote - continues to gather high profile backers, including Sir Patrick Stewart and BBC football anchor Gary Lineker - as well as donations.One supporter, Labour MP Chuka Umunna, said the impetus had shifted toward a public vote over the summer and it would be a ""betrayal of democracy"" for Mrs May ""to force a bad deal - or no deal - on Britain without giving the public the chance to have a final say""."
2018-09-02,Hundreds of prison staff caught smuggling,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902200535/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45386076,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHundreds of prison staff have been caught smuggling drugs, weapons and mobile phones into jails, according to the Observer.  A Freedom of Information request by the paper found that 341 staff in England and Wales had been dismissed, excluded, convicted or cautioned by police in the past six years as a result. Last year, there were 71 cases of staff smuggling - up from 50 in 2015.The prison service says the figures reflect the actions of a tiny minority.The response to the Observer's FoI request showed that it was not just prison officers sneaking in the items, but also health workers, trainers and other support staff.Drugs were found 13,119 times in prisons in England and Wales last year, the paper said - the equivalent of more than 35 incidents per day and three times the amount as in 2014. The Prison Officers Association (POA) said the value of the drug market in jail is around Â£100m. Peter Dawson, director of campaigning charity the Prison Reform Trust, blamed the decisions of successive governments for creating a ""perfect market"" for drugs in prison.""You have a huge number of people who have nothing to do, who have no hope and for whom drugs are one way of making the time pass.""And you have people on the outside who can make a huge amount of money by exploiting that market.""He said staff cuts had left prisons unstable, dangerous places to work with fewer experienced staff.For prisoners this meant fewer were given the opportunity to go out of the prison on a temporary licence to work or gain education, he said. This took away an incentive to say ""no"" to drugs, as a clean drugs test is needed to get permission for temporary release.The POA warned of staff shortages earlier this year, saying it had lost in excess of 7,000 frontline staff since 2010 - despite a recent push to recruit 2,500 officers. A report by the HM Inspectorate of Prisons in July found that staff shortages at Wandsworth Jail in south-west London meant visitors were not routinely scanned.A spokesman for the prison service from the Ministry of Justice said: ""The overwhelming majority of our prison staff are hard-working and honest.""But we remain vigilant to the threat posed by corruption and wrongdoing of a very small number of our staff.""Meanwhile, in a separate FOI request, the Sunday Telegraph has found that 999 calls to prisons have nearly doubled in the past three years.More than 12,200 call-outs were made last year, compared to 6,677 in 2013-14. A POA spokesman said the figures showed the ""real problems and challenges"" caused by inmates taking new psychoactive substances, such as Spice. The government said it was investing Â£14m each year to stop the criminals responsible for trading the drug. "

Jewish Labour MPs are meeting in London to demand the party fully adopts the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance guidelines on anti-Semitism.The MPs, who will be addressed by ex-leader Gordon Brown, are seeking to exert pressure on the leadership ahead of Tuesday's meeting of Labour's National Executive Committee - where the matter will be discussed. Former MP Ivor Caplin, who is chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said it and other groups were prepared to have a dialogue with leader Jeremy Corbyn but only if he made it ""very clear"" that he would take firm action against anti-Semites in the party and others engaging in ""bad behaviour"" at a local level. ""The message is simple,"" he said. ""Do what is right for Britain and then we can have further conversations.""Labour has been engulfed by stories about anti-Semitism over the summer with two MPs - John Woodcock and Frank Field - resigning the whip in protest and others threatening to do the same. Mr Field quit the Labour group at Westminster on Thursday over what he called the party's ""tolerance"" of anti-Semitism and a ""culture of nastiness"". In the past month, Mr Corbyn has been criticised for his presence at a wreath-laying ceremony in Tunisia in 2014, which was said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich terror attack. Mr Corbyn said he had attended to take part in a ceremony honouring innocent victims of a 1985 Israeli air strike. Later, footage emerged from 2013 of Mr Corbyn saying a group of British Zionists had ""no sense of English irony"".Former chief rabbi Lord Sacks branded his comments as ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech.He accused Mr Corbyn of being an ""anti-Semite"" - with the Labour leader saying he was ""more careful"" with language now.In the New Statesman interview, Mr McDonnell said: ""I think there are people who are willing to leave the party"".He went on: ""I don't understand why there is this sort of pre-emptive move to split off.""So I'm worried and I'm saddened by that, and I think that open door is always there to prevent that happening, because any split is automatically damaging.""Mr McDonnell said a repeat of the early 1980s, when a group of Labour MPs broke away and formed the SDP, would only cost Labour votes. ""So the issue for me is I'd want to avoid at all costs a split if we can.""Mr McDonnell said he wanted the issues raised by Mr Field and others addressed quickly but, according to the magazine, stopped short of calling for Labour to adopt the IHRA guidelines and all its examples in full. ""I think we can come out of it as the anti-racist party that we are, tackling the real issues,"" he added. ""I don't want to live in a society where synagogues are attacked, or where Jews graveyards daubed with swastikas or worse, Jewish children having to have security at their schools.""But writing in the Daily Telegraph on Saturday, former Home Secretary Lord Blunkett urged a rethink of the ""so-called Corbyn project"" and called on the party to abandon ""the recent return to bullying and thuggery experienced in the 1980s"".He told the party to ""belatedly get its act together"" and ""demonstrate the leadership qualities which have been lacking""."

EU negotiator Michel Barnier said he needed detail from the UK on its plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland.He told journalists that remaining ""bones of contention"" between the two sides were being steadily eliminated with particular progress on issues of security, judicial and defence co-operation after ""long"" talks on Friday.The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.Both sides are hoping to agree a divorce deal and a statement on future trading relations at a summit of EU leaders on 17 October, although Mr Raab said that deadline could be missed slightly.  He told reporters: ""We're committed to resolving the deal by (the October council) and ultimately on my side I am stubbornly optimistic that a deal is within our reach.""Mr Barnier said there was a ""measure of flexibility"" and if the process slipped by a ""few days or weeks"" it would still be possible for the UK to leave the EU with a deal, if approved by the UK and EU Parliaments, on schedule.The EU negotiator said the ""building blocks"" of an agreement were falling into place. He repeated his offer of an ""unprecedented"" future partnership with the UK but insisted this depended on an ""orderly"" withdrawal and settling key outstanding issues. He said the question of the Irish border had come down to ""minutiae"" and he needed to see the detail of how the UK proposed to manage cross-border trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the event of there being no other solution - the so-called backstop - would work in practice.""This backstop is critical,"" he said. ""It is essential to concluding the negotiations. Without a backstop, there will be no agreement."" Mr Raab said he had used Friday's talks to explain in more detail the UK's proposal for its future relationship with the EU, the so-called Chequers plan agreed by Theresa May at her country residence in July. The PM's blueprint, which would see the UK follow EU rules on trade in goods, is unpopular with many Tory MPs, with leading Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson calling for it to be ditched. Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July in protest over the PM's proposals, said he agreed with Mrs May's former aide Nick Timothy, who urged her to ditch the plan.Mr Timothy wrote on Thursday that she would have to make further concessions to get EU backing for it and this would be unacceptable.  And Stuart Jackson, the former Tory MP who until recently was an aide to Dominic Raab's predecessor David Davis, said the Chequers plan ""has not really got any friends"" on either side.""For the EU, it's outside their core principles and undermines the integrity of the single market,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""In the UK, people believe it is Brexit in name only.""The two sides say they have agreed 80% of the withdrawal agreement. The remaining 20% includes:Mr Raab vowed to increase the frequency of talks with Mr Barnier when he took over the job.But Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, a supporter of the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the outcome of the negotiations, said ""nothing had changed"" since then.""Dominic Raab may say he is more confident about reaching agreement but he can offer nothing concrete,"" he said. ""He knows the EU27 are not buying the Chequers car crash - a proposal designed around the need to hold a fractured government together and not on the economic interest and well-being of either the UK or the EU."""
2018-09-02,Abusive tweets to MPs 'more than double',https://web.archive.org//web/20180902200535/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45363720,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe number of abusive tweets about politicians more than doubled between 2015 and 2017, according to analysis of more than one million tweets.Twitter insults targeting politicians rose from about 10,000 during the 2015 general election to just under 25,000 in the snap election two years later.The best-known politicians got a lot of tweets and abuse - but less well-known MPs got proportionally more abuse.Sheffield University's computer science department carried out the research.Project leader Kalina Bontcheva said the increase in abuse towards public figures was ""shocking"". The study suggests both the volume and proportion of Twitter abuse increased between the two elections. The research showed abusive tweets made up:Abusive tweets to Ed Miliband dropped from 5.6% when he was Labour leader in 2015 to 3.3% when he returned to the back benches.Nearly 600 of the UK's 650 MPs have a Twitter account, which they use to promote their work in their constituencies, show their support for local causes and engage in debate.But MPs have been warning for several years that the level of abuse they receive has got out of control, with female MPs in particular being targeted, and threats of violence becoming common.In July, the Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said colleagues were being advised to ""close down"" their accounts by Parliament's Health and Wellbeing Service. Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott has spoken about the offensive sexist and racist messages and ""mindless abuse"" she and her staff had to endure every day on social media, not just at election time. Labour's Paula Sheriff has said the 2017 election had been the ""most brutal"" to date.On Thursday, Labour MP Stephen Doughty tweeted an example of an abusive tweet he had reported - and Twitter's response that it did not violate its policies.He said: ""If you wonder why Facebook, Twitter etc are increasingly becoming difficult places, here's another example of abuse we get and the response of the social media companies - who think we deserve a different threshold of abuse 'to allow discourse'.""Responding to the research, Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said: ""It is vital that we prevent the rising intimidation of people in public office and those who want to stand for election.""That is why this government is consulting on new measures that will protect candidates and campaigners standing for public service. We can't let intimidation of people in public life continue unchecked.""Last year a report by the Committee on Standards in Public Life said an ""intensely hostile online environment"" had been created and warned people would be put off from entering politics because of the abuse."

By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic CascianiRahman made contact with IS recruiters via social media - but unbeknown to him the contact was actually an FBI agent. That agent referred Rahman to an MI5 team of online role players who convinced him that they were genuine IS figures.""I want to do a suicide bomb on Parliament,"" Rahman told the MI5 role players. ""I want to attempt to kill Theresa May. All I need now is a sleeper cell to lay low for now.""Read more from Dominic CascianiRahman, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said, had been ""told and believed"" that the rucksack bomb given to him was ""capable of causing casualties on a scale comparable to those caused at the Manchester Arena"", where 22 people were killed.Rahman's lawyer argued he had been brainwashed by his uncle - who was later killed in a drone strike while fighting for the Islamic State group in Syria - and said his client had not intended to go through with the plot. But a probation report read to the court by the judge revealed that Rahman had admitted in prison he would have carried out the attack had he been able to.A pre-sentence report described him as a ""clever and cunning"" young man who had the potential to ""operate below the radar to dreadful effect"".Mr Justice Haddon-Cave told Rahman he would have ""plenty of time"" to study the Koran in prison, adding that Islam was ""a religion of peace"".The judge added that Rahman - originally from Birmingham - was a ""very dangerous individual"" and it was hard to predict if he will ever be de-radicalised. During his Old Bailey trial, Rahman pleaded guilty to a separate charge of engaging in conduct which assisted the preparation of terrorist acts, which related to a ""sponsorship"" video he filmed for an associate who allegedly wanted to join IS in Libya.In addition to the life sentence, Rahman was handed six years in prison for the IS sponsorship video. The sentences will run concurrently, rather than consecutively."

Peter Mond, fourth Baron Melchett, went from Eton to Cambridge University, where he read law.Illness prevented him taking his finals but he later took an MA in criminology at the University of Keele, followed by 18 months at the London School of Economics.Lord Melchett inherited his title aged 25, following the early death of his father.He became a Labour Party Whip, a junior minister at the Department of the Environment and a minister of state for Northern Ireland under Jim Callaghan.He became executive director of Greenpeace UK in 1989 and in 1999, he and 27 fellow activists faced criminal damage charges after ripping up genetically modified crops but were acquitted when the jury accepted their defence that they believed the crop would have polluted the environment.In 1985, he tried to cut through the perimeter wire of an American air base at Sculthorpe in East Anglia as part of an anti-nuclear protest. Speaking to Sue Lawley on Desert Island Discs in 2000 he said you had to have the public with you to bring about change.""You only win a campaign if people support you and people will only support you if you're right - if what you're saying is correct or if what you predict turns out to be the case,"" he said.Executive director of Greenpeace UK, John Sauven, said he would be ""sorely missed by everyone who loved wildlife and wanted to protect the global environment"".""In Peter's 12 years campaigning at Greenpeace he was both fearless in taking on big corporations like BP and Monsanto but also pioneering in supporting solutions like Greenfreeze refrigeration to save the ozone layer.""We all live a little bit more peacefully with the earth and its animals as a result of his efforts. A true radical and campaigner to the end.""Helen Browning, chief executive officer of the Soil Association, where Lord Melchett had been for 18 years, said the organisation was ""so saddened"" by his death.""[He] was such an important, charismatic figure in the environment and organic movement throughout his lifetime,"" she said.Ms Buchannan, a non-executive board member at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said: ""He was an extraordinary person but he had such credibility because he was actually farming himself in Norfolk so he wasn't' just pontificating, he was doing and he was proving how you can farm in a different way.""He held these views and did these things while at all times being a true gentleman... gentle and kind while also being brave and passionate."

David Challenor, 50, who was jailed for 22 years for child sex offences, had been the agent for Aimee Challenor at the 2017 general election.She has been suspended from the party on a no-fault basis while an investigation takes place.The party said it would release its findings once that was complete.Earlier this week Ms Challenor, 20, who was the Greens' equalities spokeswoman, pulled out of the race to be the party's deputy leader, following her father's conviction. Challenor, of Charterhouse Road, Coventry, was found guilty at Warwick Crown Court of 20 offences including sexual assault, taking indecent photographs of a child, rape of a girl aged 10 and false imprisonment, and jailed last week.The court heard he held a 10-year-old girl captive in his attic and photographed the abuse as it was carried out. His crimes came to light after the girl confided in someone and it was reported to the police, who interviewed her towards the end of 2015.Challenor was charged in November 2016, West Midlands Police said.Ms Challenor said she would be working with the inquiry and thanked those who have offered her support.She added: ""I am saddened to see circumstances have forced me away from the Greens at a crucial point for our party, though I remain fully committed to our shared Green values of environmental and social justice. ""I hope that the investigation is able to run efficiently, so that we can all move forward together.""In a statement, the Green Party said: ""An investigation will be conducted by an external agency into the circumstances and disclosures surrounding Aimee's father being able to act as her election agent while facing charges for serious sexual assault against a minor.""It said the suspension had been made following a number of complaints and would remain in place until a review at the next meeting of the Green Party Regional Council.Following Challenor's conviction, the party apologised and terminated his membership as soon as the information came to light. Following the suspension, Clare Lorraine Phipps, acting chair and secretary of Green Party Women, said: ""We will be standing by Aimee throughout her no-fault suspension and closely following the investigation to ensure that difficult lessons are indeed learnt by the party."""

But can it be done in a way that satisfies everybody?As Frank Field resigned the Labour whip on Thursday, the inner core of Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) - the ""officers' group""- was preparing to meet to draw up the agenda for what could be a stormy gathering of the full NEC next Tuesday. That meeting is set to become the forum for deciding the party's position on tackling anti-Semitism.In July, Labour adopted a new code of conduct for its MPs and other elected representatives. The new code incorporated the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition of anti-Semitism, which has been adopted by many public bodies in the UK and around the world since it was agreed in 2016.But crucially, say critics of the Labour leadership's stance on this issue, it did not reproduce four of the 11 ""contemporary examples"" of anti-Semitism in public life, cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) as guiding its work.Labour sources maintained that most of the excluded examples were covered by the new code, but had simply been reworded to give them disciplinary force.For instance, the IHRA says that ""Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis"" is an example of anti-Semitism. Labour's code says members should ""resist"" using Hitler or Nazi metaphors and that ""such language carries a strong risk of being prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party"".There was an outcry that not every example had been adopted, not just from some Jewish groups but from many Labour MPs too.The Parliamentary Labour Party - its MPs - is due to be balloted on adopting the complete IHRA document, including all the examples, on 5 September, the day after the NEC meets. While open to further amendments to the new code of conduct, there is one IHRA example of anti-Semitism in particular which Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have been reluctant to adopt: ""Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, eg, by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.""They say this would especially restrict the free speech of Palestinians - and the ability to discuss the circumstances around the foundation of the state of Israel.But with Unite's Len McCluskey and Jon Lansman of Momentum (who are usually allies of the Labour leader) now willing to adopt the IHRA examples in full, the Left is not solidly behind the initial position taken by their party leader.It also means there is now a majority on the NEC for full adoption of the IHRA document.Opponents of Jeremy Corbyn will portray this as a setback, and question why he didn't adopt the IHRA's examples earlier.But his supporters are likely to argue that he hasn't been defeated, as at July's NEC meeting it was agreed to continue to consult on Labour's code and that the party has simply changed tack in light of the consultations.Will this detoxify the issue? Well, that may depend on what accompanies the adoption of the IHRA examples.Back in July, the pro-Palestinian MP Richard Burden suggested at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party that it does indeed adopt the IHRA definition and examples in full - but that this, in his words, should be ""IHRA plus"" - the ""plus"" being a statement making clear that criticism of the Israeli government would still be legitimate.He suggested that the party take a similar tack to the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, which held an inquiry into anti-Semitism in 2016.It recommended the adoption of the IHRA definition and examples by all political parties, but with the following addendum:""It is not anti-Semitic to criticise the government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent. It is not anti-Semitic to hold the Israeli government to the same standards as other liberal democracies, or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government's policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent.""It is possible the NEC will take this approach.But there are suggestions that more wide-ranging caveats could be added - effectively neutralising the effect of adopting the ""racist endeavour"" example of anti-Semitism.It is possible the IHRA examples sit alongside Labour's code of conduct rather than be formally integrated.And the NEC may make clear that the adoption of the IHRA examples would not lead to the retrospective disciplining of party members.Some Jewish groups which have been outspoken in their criticism of the Labour leadership would be far from satisfied with this outcome.Euan Philipps, from Labour Against Anti-Semitism, has got his retaliation in first.""For the Labour Party to claim that it has re-adopted the IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism then the party would need to ensure that the definition has a functional place within the organisation's disciplinary process,"" he said in a statement.""If it is watered down by caveats and addendums then the party cannot claim that it has been fully adopted. It is a false compromise.""So some caveats could severely weaken the IHRA antidote to this toxic political issue. But there is another possible, if unlikely, outcome next week.Labour sources say there is a ""three-month rule"" at the NEC, which means the party's ruling body cannot return to exactly the same subject for further debate during this period.I'm told at least some of those who oppose adopting all the IHRA examples are considering invoking this - trying to defer the whole issue until the Labour conference in late September. That, of course, would mean that an anti-Semitism row would almost certainly overshadow that event.It's hard to believe that the leadership would welcome this. Some NEC members tell me that as anti-Semitism will now formally be on the agenda it is inconceivable that it won't be discussed.Nonetheless, there could be a procedural wrangle next week before anything of substance is debated. A demonstration is being planned by the Camden Momentum group - which takes a quite different view from Momentum's founder and NEC member Jon Lansman - outside next week's meeting, highlighting differences on the Left over this issue.It doesn't want the NEC to endorse the full IHRA document - and wants any decision to be taken by Labour's rank and file members. Last week the Camden group passed the following motion:""The members elected Jeremy Corbyn. The IHRA definition would return the party to the right which we voted down by a large majority - twice. Therefore, the members, not the NEC, nor the PLP, must decide whether or not to adopt the IHRA examples. WE DEMAND THAT THE DECISION BE PUT TO A VOTE OF ALL LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS'.""Also on the NEC agenda is a discussion of Labour's long-running Democracy Review. Rule changes arising from this review - for example, a further reduction in MPs' influence in nominating future leadership contenders - will be put to next month's Labour conference.But what isn't in the Democracy Review document could be more controversial than what is. The review hasn't called for the mandatory reselection of MPs.But some local constituency parties have been proposing rule changes to the way MPs and parliamentary candidates are selected - and it's likely these will be debated at Labour's conference.They are calling for ""open selections"" - in other words sitting MPs could be challenged by other party members between each scheduled general election. And it's possible that they could get the backing of the influential left-wing Momentum group for this controversial change.Momentum's current position is to reform the existing system of selecting candidates - where MPs aren't automatically challenged.But if Momentum decides to back open selections following a meeting of its leadership on Saturday, it's more likely the Labour conference will do likewise.I'm told there is strong grassroots pressure to do so.The influential Unite union's official policy is also to support the mandatory reselection of MPs.Labour former deputy leader Lord Hattersley has already warned that this could provoke a split.And very senior and current figures in the party are privately warning that while there may not be a huge split, the party could splinter - with a handful of MPs initially sitting as independents in protest.As politicians return to Westminster next week, Jeremy Corbyn will face the twin challenges of how to hold his party together and how to reach a consensus on tackling anti-Semitism."
2018-09-02,No Labour breakaway,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902200535/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45367473,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEvery avalanche, it is said, starts with a single pebble, and in Westminster terms, Frank Field is a pretty hefty pebble. The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee is one of Parliament's lone wolves - austere and relentless in a series of policy battles stretching back across the decades. On the committee corridor at the Palace of Westminster, he is a formidable figure who has savaged the bosses of Carillion and BHS, been a thorn in the side of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, and, if your memory stretches back across the decades, the scourge of the Maxwell brothers. So is his departure from the Labour whip the beginning of the much predicted split in the party?  Not by design, anyway. Mr Field's departure looks very much like a personal decision. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect for Labour is that he has got unhappy MPs (and there are plenty of them) thinking about their own futures. There are several factors in play.First, if the government does manage to get its plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 through Parliament - and the final proposed boundaries are expected to be published next week - then something close to a general reselection exercise may follow. That provides Jeremy Corbyn's supporters with an opportunity to remove those who don't support their leader. Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) and the party conference will have to approve a set of rules to deal with that eventuality, and the details of those rules, and the level of protection they afford to sitting MPs will be studied very closely by those who fear they are under threat. If the rules look like the vehicle for a purge, there will be trouble ahead, and some Labour MPs will calculate they have nothing to lose. There are also wider concerns about a more general revamp of party structures proposed by the former MP and close Corbyn ally Katy Clark, which would entrench the left's organisational grip. Then there's Brexit. Some of Mr Corbyn's most vocal internal critics are those who believe Labour should now be campaigning for a second referendum.They will be loath to upset the applecart while there is a chance of getting organised, cohesive Labour backing behind a Commons vote which could achieve that - and they will be looking to the forthcoming party conference to see if party policy will change, perhaps on the back of union votes. It follows that they may rethink their position if that vote doesn't materialise and the UK leaves the EU. On the other side of the coin, the four Labour MPs, Frank Field included, who voted with the government and saved it from defeat in a crucial Brexit vote in the Commons in July, have also taken considerable flak; but there are significant electoral dangers in Labour purging its Brexiteers - remember that the seats Labour lost in 2017 were mostly in Leave-voting areas. More dangerous and immediate is the anti-Semitism issue which has dogged Labour through the summer. Crucial votes on Labour's approach to it take place in the National Executive Committee next week, and then the Parliamentary Labour Party, which might defuse, or detonate the whole issue. It is hard to understate the level of fury on both sides of this row, which is why it could easily run out of control. Words have already been spoken which make it hard to imagine the protagonists kissing and making up - but a serious attempt to discipline MPs like Margaret Hodge or Ian Austin, the most vocal critics of Mr Corbyn on this issue, could trigger a walkout by their supporters.What is harder to see is how these different strands of dissent could gel into a coherent breakaway. Take Mr Field. He is not part of any Labour tribe, and he certainly does not fit neatly into the vocal group of Blairite holdouts who are Mr Corbyn's loudest critics. For a start, reflecting his Birkenhead constituency, he's a Brexiteer, so any idea that he's about to line up with Labour's hardcore Remainers at some grand launch ceremony for a new party is a non-starter. And this illustrates a wider point; there are plenty of Labour MPs who don't like Mr Corbyn, but they don't necessarily agree on much else. To work, a new party would have to be more than a lifeboat for shipwrecked careers. It would need a unifying idea under which a critical mass of activists, as well as MPs, could gather (political parties need infantry as well as generals) and it would certainly need to attract people from beyond the Labour Party.That would require devising policies which might attract Tory dissidents like Anna Soubry, as well as Labour figures like Chris Leslie or Chuka Umunna.  And such a party would also require leaders, and here there's another problem - if the 1980s SDP is the model, the possible MP defectors include plenty of Bill Rogers types, but no Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams or David Owen - big, recognisable popular figures.  My guess is the biggest threat to Labour unity is that the case of Mr Field raises the temperature and the pot starts to boil; that deselection threats escalate and that more and more MPs consider their positions.Close Corbyn ally Chris Williamson spent the summer pushing for local parties with MPs who are leadership opponents to deselect their incumbents and choose someone more congenial. Until now, many MPs uncomfortable with the Corbyn leadership have bided their time, but if they sense a real threat to their personal positions - and if the party that nurtured them seems to be changing out of recognition - then the bets may be off. Political parties are held together by more than ideology - for their members they can be a family tradition and a way of life, providing friendships and social life. Those links are hard to break, but there is a sense that for many Labour MPs and members, they are fraying. And across the party divide, the Conservatives, who are developing reselection rumbles and talk of purges of their own, are watching with a combination of opportunism and fear.   "
2018-09-02,Salmond allegation,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902200535/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-45295578,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTwo people have made sexual harassment complaints against Scotland's former first minister Alex Salmond. The complaints, which he denies, relate to his time in office. Why have they come to light now? In November, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #Metoo movement, there were concerns over reports that women at all levels in the Scottish Parliament had experienced harassment.At the same time, MPs at Westminster were accused of intimidating or propositioning young women inappropriately. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for an internal review to be carried out of the Scottish government's procedures for handling complaints in the workplace.As part of that review, a new procedure on handling harassment complaints involving current or former ministers was introduced.Two complaints in relation to Mr Salmond were made in January of this year.According to the Daily Record, they relate to events in 2013 when he was first minister.Scotland's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, informed Mr Salmond on Wednesday 22 August that she was considering the public interest in making the fact of the complaints and investigation publicly known.Mr Salmond, who was Scottish first minister from 2007 to 2014 and oversaw the independence referendum, instigated legal action aimed at preventing the Scottish government revealing details of its investigation but later dropped those proceedings.The next evening, Mr Salmond put out a statement denying claims of harassment and saying he was launching a court action to contest the Scottish government's complaints process.The details of the claims of sexual harassment and who made them have not been officially released.The Scottish government's permanent secretary, Ms Evans, would only confirm that two complaints of sexual harassment had been made against Mr Salmond.The Scottish government insisted the investigation had been ""entirely confidential"".However, the Daily Record, which broke the story on Thursday 23 August, later claimed to have seen the wording of an allegation by a Scottish government staff member.It says she alleges Mr Salmond touched her bottom and breasts through her clothing while she was alone with him at at the first minister's official residence, Bute House, in December 2013.Police Scotland has confirmed that it is ""carrying out an assessment of information which we have received and inquiries are at an early stage"".Mr Salmond has strongly denied any claims of harassment or criminality.He also accused someone in the Scottish government of ""sustained leaking"" of the ""most unfair kind"".He said it was ""crucial"" to find out who in government was responsible.The former first minister was told in March this year that allegations had been made against him and he had been assured that the process would be confidential.He claims he has still not been allowed to see the evidence against him.His statement called the procedure ""unjust"" and said he had not been able to properly challenge the case against him.Mr Salmond said the procedure, put into operation by Ms Evans three years after he left office, was ""grossly unfair"" and would lead to prejudicial outcomes.On Wednesday 29 August, Mr Salmond lodged a petition with the Court of Session in Edinburgh seeking a Judicial Review.It will decide the issue of the lawfulness of the procedure.The court will now seek a response from the Scottish government. It is likely to be some weeks before there is a hearing before a judge.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she became aware in April that Mr Salmond was being investigated.In fact, it was Mr Salmond himself that told her.She said she had no prior knowledge of complaints being made against him.Ms Sturgeon said she had taken ""no role in the process"" and not spoken about it publicly because she did not want to compromise the internal investigation.She said the fact that complaints were made could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.""Mr Salmond announced on Wednesday 29 August he was resigning from the SNP.The ex-first minister said he intended to apply to rejoin the party once he had an opportunity to clear his name.He said he was quitting because he wanted to avoid potential divisions within the party, which has faced calls to suspend him.A Judicial Review will consider whether a proper ""decision-making process"" was followed by the Scottish government.It will not look at whether or not the ""correct"" decision was made.  The court will seek to ensure that principles of natural justice and fairness have been followed.Before the review can be heard Mr Salmond must appeal to the Court of Session for permission to proceed.  Permission will only be granted where the Judicial Review has ""a real prospect of success"".  His petition was formally lodged with the court earlier this week, and the Scottish government will now have an opportunity to respond."

The European Union's critics sometimes invoke the presence of tariffs - effectively taxes on imported items - on African goods when they accuse it of being a protectionist club or racket. So how much is there to this?  The relatively simple element is the EU's arrangement for a group of nations known as Least Developed Countries (LDCs.) Of these LDCs, there are currently 33 in Africa - most of the countries on the continent. These ""are low-income countries confronting severe structural impediments to sustainable development"". These countries have duty-free access for their goods to the EU under an initiative known as Everything but Arms (EBA). The same access is also given to Equatorial Guinea, which used to be an LDC country.If it's not a weapon or ammunition, and it is made or grown in one of the countries concerned, it has duty-free access to the EU. If the product is from Ethiopia, Uganda or Malawi, for example, there would be no tariffs. There may be other barriers - such as regulations, product standards and customs documents to complete - but that also applies to goods from other countries outside Europe's single market, including the US, Japan and Canada. None of the three countries the prime minister is visiting - South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya - are on that United Nations list of LDCs. That is probably one of the reasons she chose them. They are bigger economic players and there is more to be gained from commercial relations with them. But all three of them do get some degree of relief from EU trade tariffs. There is an arrangement that covers other developing countries beyond the LDCs. It's known as the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).  Other rich countries, including the US and Japan operate their own GSPs. The EU's version applies to Nigeria and has benefited Kenya but does not cover South Africa. It doesn't open the tariff-free gates as wide as EBA does. The EU says it gives tariff-free access for 57% of products and reduced rates for most of the rest. But the minority of goods still subject to full tariffs are often farm produce. Both the Everything but Arms and the Generalised System of Preferences are unilateral. The EU simply lowers or eliminates tariffs and the partner country is under no obligation to reciprocate and cut their own tariffs on imports from the EU.But there are wider deals known as Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA). These go further and also mean a country like Kenya opening its market to the EU, though not as much as the EU does. Kenya is part of an EPA through an East African regional group. Kenya has duty-free access on an interim basis until three other countries in the group sign and ratify it so the agreement comes into full effect. South Africa, together with five other countries, has another partnership. The EU says it gives fully or partly duty-free access to 98.7% of imports coming from South Africa.  So there are tariffs that affect some South African goods. And it can get very complicated. For many types of agricultural products there are quotas at zero tariffs. For others there are reduced tariffs on a certain quota and higher duties on quantities above that. Some tariffs vary seasonally - oranges have higher tariffs when the EU crop is available. There are tariffs imposed on specific products from some African countries. Atiku Abubakar, a former vice-president of Nigeria writing in the Daily Express, was concerned about his own country.  Mr Abubakar wrote that refined sugar from Nigeria faces a tariff of more than 300% if it's exported to the EU. The EU tariff on imports of refined white sugar - not covered by any preferential arrangement or a reduced duty quota - is 419 euros per tonne. That probably would apply to sugar from Nigeria as it does not have an EPA and is not eligible for the EU's scheme for the least developed countries.  It is certainly true that the EU's tariffs on sugar are seen as high, although they are nowhere near as high as 300%.But there is another point about the EU's tariffs. Countries that don't face EU tariffs often welcome them being applied to other countries. Dr Peter Holmes of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at Sussex University points out some African sugar producers take that view. Without the tariff they would struggle to compete against the giant of the industry, Brazil.  When Mr Abubakar writes that ""if Nigeria and other African countries could export agricultural products tariff-free to Britain"", the fact is that most of them already can. Moreover Nigeria could get improved access to the EU if it accepted an EPA agreement negotiated with the EU and a group of West African nations. But President Buhari decided not to sign it, saying he wanted to protect the industries that provide jobs for Nigerians. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

Speaking to me in an interview in Singapore, where he has been touting UK trade opportunities to Asian governments and businesses, Mr Fox says that things have changed since he made that assessment. He said there appeared to have been ""an increasing engagement"" by European capitals in recent weeks, and that while he can't be ""scientific"" about the odds of a no-deal scenario - that it feels like there's an increased focus to get an agreement. His comments come as the UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said that ""no-deal wouldn't be the end of the world"".Dr Fox reiterated that the government does want a deal with Europe - but that if there is no deal ""it wouldn't be the fault of the UK government, it would be the fault of its European partners"".The negotiations over what kind of deal the UK will have with the EU have been closely watched out here in Asia, not just by governments who the UK is courting for future trade deals, but also by British businesses based out here. The uncertainty surrounding the process and the dire projections highlighted again by the UK Chancellor Philip Hammond last week about what a no-deal could do to the UK economy are some of the biggest concerns for British businesses based in the region.But while he acknowledged there would be some disruption to the UK economy in the event of a no-deal, he dismissed the estimates by the chancellor, saying they were ""rather hard to swallow"". Dr Fox also said however that if there were ""impediments to trade and investment"" that appear in Europe during this process, it would send a signal to the rest of the world's investors ""about how open Europe is to business"".The nature of the negotiations have meant that the UK cannot sign any trade deals with other countries whilst it is going through this process. But Dr Fox has come up with a new trade strategy post Brexit - saying the UK can be a 21st century exporting power.What that means in reality is harder to gauge. British businesses have told me that while the ambitions are grand - it's not clear how the government plans to implement these plans, especially across Asia where there is a lack of human infrastructure in the UK's trade department to build key relationships and lobby governments on behalf of British business. Still, Dr Fox is clocking up the air miles. He was in China before Singapore, and is due to visit Brunei next. He signed an agreement to sell more dairy to the Chinese market. The UK has been courting China with the hopes of signing a deal with Beijing post-Brexit. But when I asked him whether the UK would be willing to compromise on intellectual property agreements to get more access to the Chinese market - he said the UK wouldn't give up its ""crown jewels"".

2018-09-02,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902200535/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to Â£40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn.

At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-02,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180902200535/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

And former home secretary Amber Rudd told the BBC's Politics Live: ""Once again, it's a case of leap before you look - there's absolutely no proposal here.""Ms Rudd said the Chequers plan represented ""the best shot we have of Brexit that's going to work for the UK"". Mr Johnson resigned from the government in July in protest at the deal agreed by the cabinet at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence, as the UK's preferred way forward in negotiations with Brussels.Other Tory MPs have also criticised the package, and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, says he is ""strongly opposed"" to the proposals.Mrs May's plan would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to maintain frictionless trade at the border.Critics argue this would leave the UK tied to EU rules after it leaves on 29 March 2019, and prevent Britain from striking its own trade deals in years to come. If the UK and the EU do reach a deal, MPs will then have to approve it.In his first intervention on the EU debate since quitting the government, Mr Johnson compared negotiations between Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Mr Barnier to a wrestling match. He wrote: ""The whole thing is about as pre-ordained as a bout between Giant Haystacks and Big Daddy; and in this case, I am afraid, the inevitable outcome is a victory for the EU, with the UK lying flat on the canvas and 12 stars circling symbolically over our semi-conscious head.""Mr Johnson said negotiations based on the Chequers plan had so far seen the EU take ""every important trick"", adding: ""The UK has agreed to hand over Â£40bn of taxpayers' money for two-thirds of diddly squat.""Please upgrade your browserHe said by using the strategy - defended by Mrs May in the Sunday Telegraph over the weekend - the UK had ""gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank"".If it continued on the same path, Mr Johnson added, the government would ""throw away most of the advantages of Brexit"".Mr Johnson also accused some members of the government of using the issue of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland to ""stop a proper Brexit"", but added: ""They have been rumbled.""The ""scandal"" around the border problem was ""not that we have failed, but that we have not even tried"", he added.Mr Johnson argued that a hard border would not be needed after Brexit - because people did not need to be checked due to the Common Travel Area and that any checks on goods could be done away from the border.In response, Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""What we need at this time is serious leadership with a serious plan and that's exactly what the country has with this prime minister and this Brexit plan.""She is a serious prime minister and she has put forward serious proposals.""But Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of a group of MPs to meet Mr Barnier on Monday, suggested the EU negotiator agreed with him that the Chequers plan was ""absolute rubbish"" and he preferred the option of a looser arrangement based on Canada's trade agreement with the EU. ""Interestingly, Eurosceptics and Mr Barnier are in greater agreement than Eurosceptics and the government and between Mr Barnier and the government,"" Mr Rees-Mogg said. ""It's very encouraging.""Both @Jacob_Rees_Mogg and @hilarybennmp emerged from their select committee's meeting with @MichelBarnier saying the same thing: he and they agree that major elements of the UK's #Brexit White Paper won't work.End of Twitter post  by @adamflemingLabour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told Politics Live that if Mrs May gave in Brexiteers, ""she's going to end up coming back to Parliament with something that's not acceptable to Parliament... so then what happens?""She added: ""To hear some members of the Conservative Party play fast and loose with the [Northern Ireland] peace settlement is disgusting.""Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described Mr Johnson as a ""charlatan"" who must share in responsibility for the ""disaster"" of Brexit.Downing Street also rejected a proposal from former Conservative minister Nick Boles for the UK to stay in the European Economic Area to allow time for a new trade deal to be negotiated.Mr Boles said the PM's plan, as it stands, has ""close to zero"" chance of winning support from Parliament while former education secretary Justine Greening told Radio 4's World at One that it was ""more unpopular with the British public than the poll tax"" and Theresa May should consign it to history. ""She should now accept it has not worked and look for alternative routes through,"" she said. On Sunday, the prime minister wrote that she was ""confident"" a ""good deal"" could be reached on Brexit. But she said it was right for the government to prepare for a no-deal scenario - even though this would create ""real challenges for both the UK and the EU"" in some sectors. "
2018-09-03,Jewish row activist re-elected to Labour NEC,https://web.archive.org//web/20180903213126/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45401017,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA Labour Party official who suggested Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks has been re-elected to the party's ruling body.Peter Willsman was criticised when a recording of his remarks emerged in July, and the pro-Corbyn Momentum group withdrew its backing for him.But he is one of nine people elected to Labour's National Executive Committee.The remaining eight members of Momentum's slate were also elected.In his recorded remarks, made during a Labour NEC meeting, Mr Willsman also said he had never seen anti-Semitism in the party.He later apologised and said not all his remarks were accurately reported and that he would be referring himself for equalities training.Momentum founder Jon Lansman has also been re-elected to the executive committee. Comedian and longstanding Labour activist Eddie Izzard missed out, finishing in 10th place.The centrist Progress group put forward nine candidates but they finished well behind the Momentum slate, who were referred to by supporters on Twitter as the #JC9.Labour MP Wes Streeting, a critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership, said Mr Willsman's past comments should disqualify him from having any say over internal party rules regarding anti-Semitism.He told Channel 4 News that Mr Willsman should ""do the decent thing"" and refuse to take up the seat and, if he did not, the party should take action.While he acknowledged the left of the party had control over Labour's machinery, he said its ""paranoia"" was preventing the party from dealing with issues which were doing ""extraordinary harm"" to its reputation.But his fellow Labour MP, Chris Williamson, hailed the outcome as a victory over ""the haters and the smearers"".Bish-bash-bosh. Despite the best efforts of the haters and the smearers it's a clean sweep for the #JC9, Yes 9, in Labour's NEC election.This proves that together we are strong.#ChangeIsComing#solidarityhttps://t.co/jCNj37Pqowhttps://t.co/KORvuyqs4HEnd of Twitter post  by @DerbyChrisWAnd Momentum said it showed the power of ""ordinary members"" to shape the direction of a ""reinvigorated, democratic"" party. Labour's NEC is expected to vote on Tuesday on whether to adopt, in full, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's anti-Semitism guidelines.Labour's code of conduct, which does not include all of the IHRA examples of anti-Semitism, has caused a drawn-out row within the party.The Board of Deputies of British Jews said Mr Willsman had been ""let off the hook"" by Labour officials and Mr Corbyn should have personally intervened to rebuke him. ""The election of Peter Willsman to Labour's NEC following his reprehensible comments about Jews is deeply concerning,"" said its vice-president, Amanda Bowman.Speaking ahead of Tuesday's meeting, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he backed accepting the IHRA definition in full, including all examples.But he said the right of Labour members to criticise the actions of the Israeli government and to advocate the rights of Palestinians must be protected, as long they used acceptable language.""I am hoping we can resolve it both in terms of the Labour Party but more importantly that we can then unite and work with community organisations - particularly from the Jewish community - to tackle anti-Semitism within our wider society,"" he said.

2018-09-03,Rudd: Why I quit over Windrush,https://web.archive.org//web/20180903213126/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45399684,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAmber Rudd says she had little choice but to resign as home secretary given the ""justifiable outrage"" over the treatment of the Windrush generation.Ms Rudd quit in April after controversy over the treatment of some Commonwealth migrants and their relatives.She said people legally living in the UK had been detained and deported and she had also inadvertently misled a Commons committee about numbers.""This combination meant that I was right to resign,"" she said.Asked if she planned a comeback, she told BBC Two's Politics Live that she was ""not without ambition"".The Windrush generation had been encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973 but, in many cases, were wrongly being declared illegal immigrants. The then home secretary apologised at the time but her handling of the crisis was criticised as she sought to defend the wider impact of the government's ""hostile environment"" policy designed to deter illegal immigration.During one appearance before a Commons committee, she said there were no removals targets for illegal immigrants - comments subsequently contradicted by a 2015 inspection report. She later admitted ""local"" targets for voluntary removals had been set but told the Commons she had not been aware of them. This was subsequently contradicted by a June 2017 memo from an official, copied to Ms Rudd, that referred to targets. A letter from January 2017 also emerged in which Ms Rudd told Prime Minister Theresa May about plans to restructure her department and increase removals ""over the next few years"".Appearing on the first edition of Politics Live, Ms Rudd was asked by its presenter Jo Coburn whether she had sacrificed herself to protect Mrs May, her predecessor as home secretary, who initiated the ""hostile environment"" policy.""No, I don't think so,"" she replied. ""I think it was a situation where the home secretary at the time, when this came to light, was probably going to have to resign.""Reflecting on the events leading up to her departure, she added: ""I resigned over the fact that a number of people had been detained or deported over a period of 10 to 15 to 20 years who should not have been.""There was a justifiable outrage in the country. Within that, I got an element of an answer to a select committee wrong. The combination meant that I felt it was right to resign.""Her successor as home secretary, Sajid Javid, said last month that a review of 11,800 Windrush cases showed 164 people may have been wrongfully deported or detained.He issued a formal apology to the 18 of those ""most likely to have suffered detriment""."
2018-09-03,Field decides against calling by-election,https://web.archive.org//web/20180903213126/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45399689,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFrank Field has said he will not be triggering a by-election in his Birkenhead constituency after resigning the Labour whip.The ex-minister said nearly all of the constituents he had spoken to believed he should ""simply get on with the job"".The MP said he was set for a protracted legal dispute with the party, who have given him until 13 September to retract his resignation or face expulsion.He said he would fight any attempt to force him out of the party.Jeremy Corbyn said he was sorry to see Mr Field, who is now sitting as an independent in Westminster, go but did not understand why he had to resign.Defending his decision not to call a by-election, Mr Field said he had the backing of the constituents he had spoken to and had secured the biggest majority of his career last year, when he won by 25,514 votes. ""Practically all of the local residents who have contacted me in recent days have stressed that I should simply get on with the job of representing Birkenhead,"" he said.""The whole of my time will continue, as in the past, with trying to serve Birkenhead to the best of my ability and spearheading a whole series of major projects in the town.""Mr Field quit the Labour group in Parliament last week, warning of a culture of bullying and intimidation within the party and criticising what he said was the leadership's failure to deal with the anti-Semitism row.The MP is a strong supporter of Brexit and lost a vote of no confidence in his local Labour party last month after siding with the government and voting against calls for a customs union after the UK leaves.Mr Field said he would not back down and still hoped to retain his Labour Party membership.""I now have what may become a major legal dispute with the Labour Party over my continuing membership of the party,"" he said. ""I shall fight any attempt at expelling me in every way I can and, if need be, in the courts."""
2018-09-03,Momentum backs Labour candidate shake-up,https://web.archive.org//web/20180903213126/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45389424,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMomentum has said it will back calls for the process of selecting Labour election candidates to be ""opened up"", at the party's conference this month.The Jeremy Corbyn-supporting campaign group said it wanted to see a ""new generation"" of Labour MPs.It wants activists to be able to challenge sitting MPs rather than see them renominated by party branches.Some MPs who have been critical of Mr Corbyn's leadership fear the idea is aimed at purging them from the party.Two MPs on the right of the party - Frank Field and John Woodcock - have quit the whip in recent times complaining of a culture of bullying and intimidation in the party.Those on the left say they are out of step with the direction of the party and point to the fact Mr Field lost a vote of confidence among members of his local constituency party in Birkenhead in July. Local Labour branches are set to put forward a host of proposals to the conference in Liverpool later this month aimed at shaking up the party's internal procedures, although it is not yet clear how many will actually be debated, let alone win the support of the leadership.According to the Observer, one of the ideas being put forward is to scrap the rule which makes it an expellable offence to ""support a political organisation other than an official Labour group"".The sanction has been in place since the 1980s when Labour was fighting entryism by the hard-left Militant group. The paper said five local branches so far had expressed support for it being removed.Most of the focus, however, will be on demands for mandatory reselection, where local members will be given the opportunity to to choose from a shortlist of candidates, including the sitting MP. At the moment, the vast majority of incumbent MPs are reselected if they get the backing of a simple majority of constituency party members.Momentum said there was a ""groundswell"" of support from among its members for this system to change and for there to be a ""level-playing field"" between different candidates. ""Labour has to nurture the talent of its half a million members and we cannot let an outdated rulebook hold back a new generation of MPs,"" it said in a statement.""Labour's selection procedure should be democratic, give a fair chance to all candidates and encourage positive campaigning. This means ending the divisive practise of forcing activists to campaign against sitting MPs and replacing it with a process that is open from the start.""Opening up the selection process will create a more level playing field between candidates.""The vast majority of MPs oppose mandatory reselection, believing the demands are politically motivated.The conference is expected to discuss the findings of a ""democracy review"" commissioned by Jeremy Corbyn in 2016, including into the rules for future leadership contests. But the question of mandatory reselection was not part of taskforce's remit."

""We need to see a clear commitment from them to remove all investments, direct or indirect, from fossil fuel companies.""The charity's report, worked on jointly with Platform and 350.org, suggests Welsh pension funds are supporting companies which are fracking in Argentina, USA, Canada, Australia, China and Oman.They claim the controversial technique - designed to recover gas and oil from shale rock - is simply distracting energy firms and governments from investing in renewable sources of energy, and encouraging continued reliance on fossil fuels.But supporters - including the UK government - argue it has the potential to provide the UK with greater energy security, jobs and growth.Wales's Future Generations Commissioner has previously called on Welsh councils to demonstrate how mitigating the risk of climate change is being incorporated into their pension funds' investment strategy.Speaking in March, after it was revealed Â£1bn of pension fund investment in Wales was being spent on fossil fuel companies, Sophie Howe said: ""Under the Well-being of Future Generations Act public bodies need to demonstrate how they are thinking about the social, economic, environmental and cultural well-being of Wales for now and for future generations.""""In line with the Paris Agreement, the Environment (Wales) Act and the Well-being of Future Generations Act, pension funds should be demonstrating how they are considering climate risk in their investment decisions.  I want to know how they have done this and what action has been taken; in particular, has any formal advice been sought and a climate risk investment strategy been developed and implemented?""The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said that all Welsh funds were members of the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) which considers and advises on ethical and climate-related investment issues.""The WLGA encourages the development of ethical investment principles,"" said a spokesman.  ""The pooling of the eight funds in Wales offers an opportunity to share good practice under the Welsh pension partnership joint committee in relation to responsible investment including fossil fuels."" ""This should complement the primary fiduciary duty of each fund which is to invest for the benefit of over 300,000 members of the local government pension scheme in Wales."""
2018-09-03,Javid threatens tech giants over child abuse,https://web.archive.org//web/20180903213126/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45389937,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHome Secretary Sajid Javid has warned he will ""not be afraid to take action"" against tech giants if they do not help to tackle child sexual abuse online.Mr Javid said he was ""demanding"" companies take ""more measures"" - or face new legislation.He added that some sites were refusing to take online abuse seriously - and highlighted live-streaming of child abuse as a growing problem.Facebook, Google and Microsoft say they are committed to tackling the issue.Mr Javid said it was his ""personal mission"" to tackle online child abuse, adding: ""I've been impressed by the progress the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Apple have made on counter-terrorism.""Now I want to see the same level of commitment from these companies and others for child sexual exploitation.""Last week, his cabinet colleague Jeremy Hunt criticised Google for failing to ""cooperate"" with the UK over the issue.Mr Javid refused to go into detail about what new legislation surrounding abuse might look like.However, he stated his desire for tech companies to work more closely with law enforcement agencies, stop child grooming on their sites and block abuse material as soon as they detect it being uploaded.Referrals of child abuse images to the National Crime Agency (NCA) have surged by 700% in the last five years, according to new figures - and the NCA estimates that about 80,000 people in the UK present some kind of sexual threat to children online.Furthermore, the images being uncovered are getting more graphic, the Home Office said, with abuse of babies and children under 10 becoming more frequently documented.The Home Office warned that live-streaming of abuse was also on the rise, enabled by faster internet speeds, smartphone technology and the growing ease of money transfers across borders.In his speech, Mr Javid said: ""One officer I met during a visit to the NCA's Child Exploitation Online Protection Command, who had previously worked in counter-terrorism for over 20 years, told me how in all his years of working he's never been so shocked by the scale of the threat or the determination of the offenders as he is in his current job."" He went on: ""The threat has evolved a lot more quickly than the industry's response and industry has just not kept up.""So let me say this - I'm not just asking for change, I am demanding it and the people are demanding it too - and if the web giants do not take more measures to remove this type of content from their platforms, I will not be afraid to take action.""By Joe Whitwell, BBC Technology reporterMillions of hours of video are uploaded to social networks every day, so finding illegal material can be like looking for a needle in a haystack.Most of the tech giants have been investing in artificial intelligence to proactively search for videos and posts that contravene their policies or the laws of the countries they operate in. In March 2017, Facebook rolled out pattern-recognition algorithms to help detect Facebook Live posts from people who might be thinking of harming themselves.But algorithms alone cannot police content - and even a small percentage of incorrectly flagged videos could amount to thousands of clips every day. Human reviewers remain an important part of the equation - but hiring them costs money.In January, Germany introduced a new law demanding that social networks quickly remove illegal material or face fines of up to 50m euros.That proved to be just the motivation many social networks needed to step up to the challenge. Facebook reportedly recruited several hundred new staff in Germany to deal with reports of illegal content.Figures indicate that police in England and Wales recorded about 23 child sexual offences involving the internet every day in 2017/18 - up from about 15 a day in the previous 12 months. The scale of the offending has led to demands for internet giants to take more action to stop access to sexual abuse images and videos.Technology companies doing more to remove indecent images from circulation would be a ""monumental landmark"" in child protection, the NCA said.There have also been calls for tougher sentences for people who download indecent images of children.The agency added that in one week of action in July, 131 arrests were made, including teachers, a children's entertainer and a former police officer. Only 13 of those arrested were registered sex offenders, 19 others held positions of trust.The threat of online #ChildSexualAbuse has evolved quicker than the tech industryâs response to it, says Home Secretary @sajidjavid: âI am not just asking for change, I am demanding it.â pic.twitter.com/ruj732LleQEnd of Twitter post  by @ukhomeofficeThe Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which assesses and removes online child abuse material, said it fully supported Mr Javid in his warning.Susie Hargreaves, IWF chief executive, said offenders were becoming more ""sophisticated in their crime"".Tony Stower, head of child safety online at the NSPCC, said it was right that the Home Secretary is laying down the challenge to big tech companies.He said: ""These firms have been told time and again to play their part in stopping online child abuse, but have done very little.""The NSPCC is calling on the government to create an independent regulator with power to investigate and fine platforms which do not do enough to catch groomers.Facebook said it takes the exploitation of children very seriously.A spokesperson told the BBC: ""It's why Facebook works closely with child protection experts, the police and other technology companies to block and remove exploitative photos and videos, as well as to prevent grooming online. ""We agree with the home secretary that by continuing to work together in this way, we can make more progress, faster.""Google said it takes a zero-tolerance approach to child sexual abuse material and has invested for two decades in technology, teams and partnerships to tackle the issue.The firm announced that it was making available ""cutting-edge"" artificial intelligence that can dramatically improve how non-governmental organisations and other technology companies review content ""at scale"" and protect more children.Microsoft condemned child sexual exploitation as a ""horrific crime"", stating that the company works closely with others in industry, government and civil society to help combat its spread online.A spokeswoman said: ""Predators are constantly evolving their tactics and that is why we work collaboratively with other companies... to create tools that protect children online and help bring perpetrators to justice.""If you're worried that a child or young person is at risk or is being abused you can contact the children's social care team at their local council. You can choose not to give your details.You can report it online to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection command (Ceop).Or you can call the NSPCC 24-hour helpline on 0808 800 5000 for expert advice and support.If a child is at immediate risk call 999, or call the police on 101 if you think a crime has been committed.Children and young people can call Childline free on 0800 1111 where trained counsellors are available 24 hours a day, every day."

It has been made clear to me that no deal has been agreed and the extension might be much less than a year, if it happens.The Canadian is due to appear before MPs on the Treasury committee on Tuesday and will be asked about his intentions.In October 2016 Mr Carney said he would step down in June 2019 - one year more than the five he had committed to, but still two years short of the usual eight-year term that governors serve.Speculation about the governor's future was first sparked by an item on the Evening Standard's diary pages last week saying the government had approached him about staying on."
2018-09-03,Johnson: Chequers means Brexit disaster,https://web.archive.org//web/20180903213126/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45392105,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBoris Johnson has savaged Theresa May's Brexit plans, saying they would leave the UK with ""diddly squat"" after the negotiations and hand the EU ""victory"".The ex-foreign secretary used his Daily Telegraph column to say the Chequers deal ""means disaster"" for Britain.Downing Street hit back, saying his article contained ""no new ideas"" and that ""serious leadership with a serious plan"" was needed.It comes after the EU's negotiator criticised the UK's proposals.The so-called Chequers deal was agreed by cabinet at the prime minister's country residence as the UK's preferred way forward in negotiations with Brussels.Mrs May's plan would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to maintain frictionless trade at the border. It also officially ends the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK, but the ECJ would continue to be ""the interpreter of EU rules"" that the UK has agreed to stick to.Critics say the deal will leave the UK tied to EU rules and prevent Britain from striking its own trade deals in years to come. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March.The negotiations between the UK and EU have an informal deadline tied to a summit in October - although figures on both sides have said it could slip back to November.If the UK and the EU do reach a deal, MPs will then have to approve it - and BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described what happens if they reject it as a ""great unknown"".""Nobody can answer that question because it simply has not happened before,"" she added.In his first intervention on the EU debate since quitting the government, Mr Johnson compared negotiations between Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Mr Barnier to a wrestling match. He wrote: ""The whole thing is about as pre-ordained as a bout between Giant Haystacks and Big Daddy; and in this case, I am afraid, the inevitable outcome is a victory for the EU, with the UK lying flat on the canvas and 12 stars circling symbolically over our semi-conscious head.""Mr Johnson said negotiations based on the Chequers plan had so far seen the EU take ""every important trick"", adding: ""The UK has agreed to hand over Â£40bn of taxpayers' money for two-thirds of diddly squat.""Please upgrade your browserHe said by using the strategy - defended by Mrs May in the Sunday Telegraph over the weekend - the UK had ""gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank"".If it continued on the same path, Mr Johnson added, the government would ""throw away most of the advantages of Brexit"".Mr Johnson also accused some members of the government of using the issue of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland to ""stop a proper Brexit"", but added: ""They have been rumbled.""The ""scandal"" around the border problem was ""not that we have failed, but that we have not even tried"", he added.Mr Johnson argued that a hard border would not be needed after Brexit - because people did not need to be checked due to the Common Travel Area and that any checks on goods could be done away from the border.In response, Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""Boris Johnson resigned over Chequers. There's no new ideas in this article to respond to.""What we need at this time is serious leadership with a serious plan and that's exactly what the country has with this prime minister and this Brexit plan.""She is a serious prime minister and she has put forward serious proposals.""Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""Typical Johnson. False promises. Then refusal to take responsibility for his own actions. It's always someone else's fault.""Meanwhile, in an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier criticised the Chequers deal, saying to agree to it would see ""the end of the single market and the European project"".He said plans for a ""common rulebook"" for goods but not services were not in the EU's interests, adding: ""Our own ecosystem has grown over decades. You cannot play with it by picking pieces.""""The British have a choice,"" he said. ""They could stay in the single market, like Norway, which is also not a member of the EU - but they would then have to take over all the associated rules and contributions to European solidarity. It is your choice.""But if we let the British pick the raisins out of our rules, that would have serious consequences.""Then all sorts of other third[-party] countries could insist that we offer them the same benefits.""Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, one of Mrs May's allies, former First Secretary of State Damian Green, said it would be ""difficult but not impossible"" for the Chequers plan to win the support of MPs in the House of Commons.He said it was ""absolutely certain"" there was no Parliamentary majority for a so-called ""hard Brexit"" and challenged supporters of that option to come up with a proposal that could win the support of the House of Commons.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who resigned in protest at the Chequers plan, told ITV's Good Morning Britain Mrs May should not be replaced, because ""we don't need any more turbulence right now"".""What matters in all of this is not the personality politics, it's the outcome at the end,"" he added.Responding to Mr Barnier's remarks, a government spokeswoman said of Chequers: ""This proposal achieves a new balance of rights and obligations that fulfils our joint ambition to establish a deep and special partnership once the UK has left the EU while preserving the constitutional integrity of the UK. There is no other proposal that does that.""Our negotiating teams have upped the intensity, and we continue to move at pace to reach - as Mr Barnier says - an ambitious partnership, which will work in the mutual interests of citizens and businesses in the UK and in the EU.""On Sunday, Mrs May wrote that she was ""confident"" a ""good deal"" could be reached on Brexit. But she said it was right for the government to prepare for a no-deal scenario - even though this would create ""real challenges for both the UK and the EU"" in some sectors. "

""Our own ecosystem has grown over decades,"" he said. ""You can not play with it by picking pieces.""While he has previously expressed criticism about Mrs May's Chequers plan, sources close to Mr Barnier told the BBC he has not been this explicit before.In response, the UK government insisted its plans were ""precise and pragmatic"" and would work for the UK and the EU.The negotiations between the UK and the EU have an informal October deadline, but Mr Barnier said this could be extended to mid-November. In an interview with the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr Barnier said Mrs May's plans ""would be the end of the single market and the European project"".""The British have a choice,"" he said.

There is another reason why I strongly oppose the British proposal. ""There are services in every product.

2018-09-03,Labour can 'end anti-Semitism row quickly',https://web.archive.org//web/20180903213126/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45388447,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour can resolve its anti-Semitism crisis quickly, John McDonnell has said, insisting Jeremy Corbyn's views on Israel have been ""misinterpreted"".The shadow chancellor told the BBC that the party should accept in full the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance guidelines on anti-Semitism, as long as free speech was protected.But ex-Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks said Mr Corbyn must also ""repent and recant"".And ex-PM Gordon Brown said Labour must act now or undermine its values.Speaking at a meeting of Jewish Labour MPs in London, Mr Brown said the party needed to be ""cleansed of anti-Semitism and racism"". The party has been beset by arguments over the issue throughout the summer, prompting ex-minister Frank Field to resign the whip on Thursday and others to threaten to do the same. John Woodcock also cited it as one of the reasons for quitting the party in July. Claims that the leadership is failing to tackle anti-Semitism and, in some cases, condoning it came to a head last month when footage from 2013 emerged of Mr Corbyn saying a group of British Zionists had ""no sense of English irony"" despite a lifetime in the country. Labour MP Luciana Berger said it made her ""feel unwelcome"" in the party while Lord Sacks branded his comments as ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since the late Conservative MP Enoch Powell's 1968 Rivers of Blood speech.Speaking publicly for the first time since he made those remarks, the former chief rabbi told the Andrew Marr show he stood by his criticism of Mr Corbyn and suggested British Jews were considering leaving the country because of the prospect of him becoming prime minister.""Jeremy Corbyn must repent and recant as quickly as possible,"" he said.""When people hear the kind of language that's been coming out of Labour, that's been brought to the surface among Jeremy Corbyn's earlier speeches, they cannot but feel an existential threat.""I'm afraid that until he expresses clear remorse for what he said and what his party has done to its Jewish sympathisers, as well as its Jewish MPs, then he is as great a danger as Enoch Powell was.""Anyone who uses the term 'Zionist' loosely without great care is in danger of engulfing Britain in the kind of flames of hatred that have reappeared throughout Europe and is massively irresponsible.""But Mr McDonnell said that while Lord Sacks had been ""brutally honest"", he was wide of the mark, because Mr Corbyn had never solely blamed Israel for the conflict in the Middle East and had consciously distinguished between Zionists and the Jewish population in general.""I just say to Lord Sacks 'you've got it wrong, come and talk to us',"" he said. ""You've misinterpreted what's gone on. I think you've got, really have misinterpreted Jeremy. I've known him for over 30 years. His whole life has been devoted to anti-racism, to peace and justice.""He said the decision on whether to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance guidelines in full, to be discussed on Tuesday, was a matter for Labour's ruling body but he suggested he backed it personally.He claimed a solution was within reach that could ""satisfy all sides"" if Labour promised ""full engagement"" with the Jewish community going forward but members were able to continue to criticise the actions of the Israeli government within clear boundaries and the rights of Palestinians were also recognised.""I think we can resolve this fairly quickly, constructively and with good will, working together,"" he said.Speaking at a meeting of the Jewish Labour Movement, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the definition must be adopted ""unanimously, unequivocally and immediately"".Warning about the rise in anti-Semitic attacks in recent years, he said the problem was not ""abstract and theoretical but real and present and had to be dealt with now"". Labour, he said, had historically often been the ""last line of defence against persecution and discrimination"" in society and the party could not allow itself to be seen as the ""first line of attack"". ""It is not simply about a procedure. It is about who we are, what we stand for, what makes us tick and the soul of the Labour Party,"" he said. On 26 May, in Bucharest, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance adopted the following non-legally binding working definition of anti-Semitism: ""Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. ""Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.""The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said Labour's NEC was likely to adopt the definition but with caveats amid concerns about the stifling of ""legitimate criticism"" of Israel. Former MP Ivor Caplin, who is chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, said it and other groups were only prepared to have a dialogue with Mr Corbyn if he made it ""very clear"" that he would take firm action against anti-Semites in the party and others engaging in ""bad behaviour"" at a local level. Amid growing warnings that Labour was facing a 1980s-style split, Mr McDonnell said the party must remain a ""broad church"" and he hoped Mr Field would ""come back into the fold"". The Birkenhead MP, a former welfare minister, quit the Labour group at Westminster on Thursday over what he called the party's ""tolerance"" of anti-Semitism and a ""culture of nastiness"". While Labour MPs who resigned the whip should normally trigger a by-election, Mr McDonnell said in this case he did not want to ""go anywhere near that"" given Mr Field's long service to the party. "

But can it be done in a way that satisfies everybody?As Frank Field resigned the Labour whip on Thursday, the inner core of Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) - the ""officers' group""- was preparing to meet to draw up the agenda for what could be a stormy gathering of the full NEC next Tuesday. That meeting is set to become the forum for deciding the party's position on tackling anti-Semitism.In July, Labour adopted a new code of conduct for its MPs and other elected representatives. The new code incorporated the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition of anti-Semitism, which has been adopted by many public bodies in the UK and around the world since it was agreed in 2016.But crucially, say critics of the Labour leadership's stance on this issue, it did not reproduce four of the 11 ""contemporary examples"" of anti-Semitism in public life, cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) as guiding its work.Labour sources maintained that most of the excluded examples were covered by the new code, but had simply been reworded to give them disciplinary force.For instance, the IHRA says that ""Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis"" is an example of anti-Semitism. Labour's code says members should ""resist"" using Hitler or Nazi metaphors and that ""such language carries a strong risk of being prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party"".There was an outcry that not every example had been adopted, not just from some Jewish groups but from many Labour MPs too.The Parliamentary Labour Party - its MPs - is due to be balloted on adopting the complete IHRA document, including all the examples, on 5 September, the day after the NEC meets. While open to further amendments to the new code of conduct, there is one IHRA example of anti-Semitism in particular which Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have been reluctant to adopt: ""Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, eg, by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.""They say this would especially restrict the free speech of Palestinians - and the ability to discuss the circumstances around the foundation of the state of Israel.But with Unite's Len McCluskey and Jon Lansman of Momentum (who are usually allies of the Labour leader) now willing to adopt the IHRA examples in full, the Left is not solidly behind the initial position taken by their party leader.It also means there is now a majority on the NEC for full adoption of the IHRA document.Opponents of Jeremy Corbyn will portray this as a setback, and question why he didn't adopt the IHRA's examples earlier.But his supporters are likely to argue that he hasn't been defeated, as at July's NEC meeting it was agreed to continue to consult on Labour's code and that the party has simply changed tack in light of the consultations.Will this detoxify the issue? Well, that may depend on what accompanies the adoption of the IHRA examples.Back in July, the pro-Palestinian MP Richard Burden suggested at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party that it does indeed adopt the IHRA definition and examples in full - but that this, in his words, should be ""IHRA plus"" - the ""plus"" being a statement making clear that criticism of the Israeli government would still be legitimate.He suggested that the party take a similar tack to the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, which held an inquiry into anti-Semitism in 2016.It recommended the adoption of the IHRA definition and examples by all political parties, but with the following addendum:""It is not anti-Semitic to criticise the government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent. It is not anti-Semitic to hold the Israeli government to the same standards as other liberal democracies, or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government's policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent.""It is possible the NEC will take this approach.But there are suggestions that more wide-ranging caveats could be added - effectively neutralising the effect of adopting the ""racist endeavour"" example of anti-Semitism.It is possible the IHRA examples sit alongside Labour's code of conduct rather than be formally integrated.And the NEC may make clear that the adoption of the IHRA examples would not lead to the retrospective disciplining of party members.Some Jewish groups which have been outspoken in their criticism of the Labour leadership would be far from satisfied with this outcome.Euan Philipps, from Labour Against Anti-Semitism, has got his retaliation in first.""For the Labour Party to claim that it has re-adopted the IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism then the party would need to ensure that the definition has a functional place within the organisation's disciplinary process,"" he said in a statement.""If it is watered down by caveats and addendums then the party cannot claim that it has been fully adopted. It is a false compromise.""So some caveats could severely weaken the IHRA antidote to this toxic political issue. But there is another possible, if unlikely, outcome next week.Labour sources say there is a ""three-month rule"" at the NEC, which means the party's ruling body cannot return to exactly the same subject for further debate during this period.I'm told at least some of those who oppose adopting all the IHRA examples are considering invoking this - trying to defer the whole issue until the Labour conference in late September. That, of course, would mean that an anti-Semitism row would almost certainly overshadow that event.It's hard to believe that the leadership would welcome this. Some NEC members tell me that as anti-Semitism will now formally be on the agenda it is inconceivable that it won't be discussed.Nonetheless, there could be a procedural wrangle next week before anything of substance is debated. A demonstration is being planned by the Camden Momentum group - which takes a quite different view from Momentum's founder and NEC member Jon Lansman - outside next week's meeting, highlighting differences on the Left over this issue.It doesn't want the NEC to endorse the full IHRA document - and wants any decision to be taken by Labour's rank and file members. Last week the Camden group passed the following motion:""The members elected Jeremy Corbyn. The IHRA definition would return the party to the right which we voted down by a large majority - twice. Therefore, the members, not the NEC, nor the PLP, must decide whether or not to adopt the IHRA examples. WE DEMAND THAT THE DECISION BE PUT TO A VOTE OF ALL LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS'.""Also on the NEC agenda is a discussion of Labour's long-running Democracy Review. Rule changes arising from this review - for example, a further reduction in MPs' influence in nominating future leadership contenders - will be put to next month's Labour conference.But what isn't in the Democracy Review document could be more controversial than what is. The review hasn't called for the mandatory reselection of MPs.But some local constituency parties have been proposing rule changes to the way MPs and parliamentary candidates are selected - and it's likely these will be debated at Labour's conference.They are calling for ""open selections"" - in other words sitting MPs could be challenged by other party members between each scheduled general election. And it's possible that they could get the backing of the influential left-wing Momentum group for this controversial change.Momentum's current position is to reform the existing system of selecting candidates - where MPs aren't automatically challenged.But if Momentum decides to back open selections following a meeting of its leadership on Saturday, it's more likely the Labour conference will do likewise.I'm told there is strong grassroots pressure to do so.The influential Unite union's official policy is also to support the mandatory reselection of MPs.Labour former deputy leader Lord Hattersley has already warned that this could provoke a split.And very senior and current figures in the party are privately warning that while there may not be a huge split, the party could splinter - with a handful of MPs initially sitting as independents in protest.As politicians return to Westminster next week, Jeremy Corbyn will face the twin challenges of how to hold his party together and how to reach a consensus on tackling anti-Semitism."

We received the data through an FOI application - which the Home Office took seven months to process. The BBC's request was only answered after the Home Office was instructed to do so by the Information Commissioner, who intervened when we complained that the department had not replied.The Home Office admits that its delay in some cases has been ""unacceptable"". In the past it has been censured by the Information Commissioner's Office over its slow handling of FOI applications, which the ICO has described as ""extremely lengthy"", ""particularly severe"" and ""inexplicable and unjustifiable"".However Elizabeth Denham, the commissioner, faces criticism from openness campaigners for not taking stronger action over these persistent failings. The Campaign for Freedom of Information says ""the ICO has been asleep on the job"".In the longest case covered by the data obtained, the Home Office replied to a request submitted on 8 September 2015 after nearly 34 months had expired, on 5 July 2018. In another it took 29 months, not answering an inquiry made in September 2015 until February 2018.The figures also show that more than 500 requests made since the 2015 general election have taken longer than six months to be answered.In the period covered by this data, the Home Office received a total of 9,786 FOI applications. Under the law they must be answered within 20 working days, or this can be extended for a ""reasonable"" period if necessary to assess whether the material is exempt from being released. The Information Commissioner expects that all requests should normally be dealt with within 40 working days.In a few instances the lengthy delay appears to stem from the role of special advisers.There were nine requests where special advisers took at least a year between the case being passed to them by officials and finally clearing the response. There are 54 other examples where the special adviser stage of the process took at least six months. But this helps to explain the extreme delays in only a minority of cases. A Home Office spokesman said: ""The Home Office receives a high number of FOI requests, some complex and sensitive. The most recent published statistics show we answered 89% of non-routine requests within the deadline or with a permitted extension. ""However we acknowledge that the delay in some cases was unacceptable.  We have worked with the ICO to improve the department's FOI performance. The ICO has noted that we have made and will continue to make steps to improve.""The department's poor track record has annoyed FOI activists. Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information says the Home Office figures reveal ""industrial scale disregard of their FOI obligations"". He said: ""To have taken over two years to respond to some requests is completely off the charts. They've been allowed to get away with this for a very long time. That suggests the ICO has been asleep on the job.""The ICO states it is establishing a new dedicated compliance and monitoring department. A spokesperson said: ""We recognise that many public bodies deal with sensitive issues and deciding whether to disclose is not always straightforward. That is why we work with organisations, so that their responses to requests can be given more effectively and efficiently.""""However, the Commissioner is confident that public authorities are fully aware of her enforcement powers and her commitment to exercise those powers in appropriate cases."""

The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee is one of Parliament's lone wolves - austere and relentless in a series of policy battles stretching back across the decades. On the committee corridor at the Palace of Westminster, he is a formidable figure who has savaged the bosses of Carillion and BHS, been a thorn in the side of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, and, if your memory stretches back across the decades, the scourge of the Maxwell brothers. So is his departure from the Labour whip the beginning of the much predicted split in the party?  Not by design, anyway. Mr Field's departure looks very much like a personal decision. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect for Labour is that he has got unhappy MPs (and there are plenty of them) thinking about their own futures. There are several factors in play.First, if the government does manage to get its plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 through Parliament - and the final proposed boundaries are expected to be published next week - then something close to a general reselection exercise may follow. That provides Jeremy Corbyn's supporters with an opportunity to remove those who don't support their leader. Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) and the party conference will have to approve a set of rules to deal with that eventuality, and the details of those rules, and the level of protection they afford to sitting MPs will be studied very closely by those who fear they are under threat. If the rules look like the vehicle for a purge, there will be trouble ahead, and some Labour MPs will calculate they have nothing to lose. There are also wider concerns about a more general revamp of party structures proposed by the former MP and close Corbyn ally Katy Clark, which would entrench the left's organisational grip. Then there's Brexit. Some of Mr Corbyn's most vocal internal critics are those who believe Labour should now be campaigning for a second referendum.They will be loath to upset the applecart while there is a chance of getting organised, cohesive Labour backing behind a Commons vote which could achieve that - and they will be looking to the forthcoming party conference to see if party policy will change, perhaps on the back of union votes. It follows that they may rethink their position if that vote doesn't materialise and the UK leaves the EU. On the other side of the coin, the four Labour MPs, Frank Field included, who voted with the government and saved it from defeat in a crucial Brexit vote in the Commons in July, have also taken considerable flak; but there are significant electoral dangers in Labour purging its Brexiteers - remember that the seats Labour lost in 2017 were mostly in Leave-voting areas. More dangerous and immediate is the anti-Semitism issue which has dogged Labour through the summer. Crucial votes on Labour's approach to it take place in the National Executive Committee next week, and then the Parliamentary Labour Party, which might defuse, or detonate the whole issue. It is hard to understate the level of fury on both sides of this row, which is why it could easily run out of control. Words have already been spoken which make it hard to imagine the protagonists kissing and making up - but a serious attempt to discipline MPs like Margaret Hodge or Ian Austin, the most vocal critics of Mr Corbyn on this issue, could trigger a walkout by their supporters.What is harder to see is how these different strands of dissent could gel into a coherent breakaway. Take Mr Field. He is not part of any Labour tribe, and he certainly does not fit neatly into the vocal group of Blairite holdouts who are Mr Corbyn's loudest critics. For a start, reflecting his Birkenhead constituency, he's a Brexiteer, so any idea that he's about to line up with Labour's hardcore Remainers at some grand launch ceremony for a new party is a non-starter. And this illustrates a wider point; there are plenty of Labour MPs who don't like Mr Corbyn, but they don't necessarily agree on much else. To work, a new party would have to be more than a lifeboat for shipwrecked careers. It would need a unifying idea under which a critical mass of activists, as well as MPs, could gather (political parties need infantry as well as generals) and it would certainly need to attract people from beyond the Labour Party.That would require devising policies which might attract Tory dissidents like Anna Soubry, as well as Labour figures like Chris Leslie or Chuka Umunna.  And such a party would also require leaders, and here there's another problem - if the 1980s SDP is the model, the possible MP defectors include plenty of Bill Rogers types, but no Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams or David Owen - big, recognisable popular figures.  My guess is the biggest threat to Labour unity is that the case of Mr Field raises the temperature and the pot starts to boil; that deselection threats escalate and that more and more MPs consider their positions.Close Corbyn ally Chris Williamson spent the summer pushing for local parties with MPs who are leadership opponents to deselect their incumbents and choose someone more congenial. Until now, many MPs uncomfortable with the Corbyn leadership have bided their time, but if they sense a real threat to their personal positions - and if the party that nurtured them seems to be changing out of recognition - then the bets may be off. Political parties are held together by more than ideology - for their members they can be a family tradition and a way of life, providing friendships and social life. Those links are hard to break, but there is a sense that for many Labour MPs and members, they are fraying. And across the party divide, the Conservatives, who are developing reselection rumbles and talk of purges of their own, are watching with a combination of opportunism and fear.   "
2018-09-03,Salmond allegation,https://web.archive.org//web/20180903213126/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-45295578,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTwo people have made sexual harassment complaints against Scotland's former first minister Alex Salmond. The complaints, which he denies, relate to his time in office. Why have they come to light now? In November, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #Metoo movement, there were concerns over reports that women at all levels in the Scottish Parliament had experienced harassment.At the same time, MPs at Westminster were accused of intimidating or propositioning young women inappropriately. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for an internal review to be carried out of the Scottish government's procedures for handling complaints in the workplace.As part of that review, a new procedure on handling harassment complaints involving current or former ministers was introduced.Two complaints in relation to Mr Salmond were made in January of this year.According to the Daily Record, they relate to events in 2013 when he was first minister.Scotland's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, informed Mr Salmond on Wednesday 22 August that she was considering the public interest in making the fact of the complaints and investigation publicly known.Mr Salmond, who was Scottish first minister from 2007 to 2014 and oversaw the independence referendum, instigated legal action aimed at preventing the Scottish government revealing details of its investigation but later dropped those proceedings.The next evening, Mr Salmond put out a statement denying claims of harassment and saying he was launching a court action to contest the Scottish government's complaints process.The details of the claims of sexual harassment and who made them have not been officially released.The Scottish government's permanent secretary, Ms Evans, would only confirm that two complaints of sexual harassment had been made against Mr Salmond.The Scottish government insisted the investigation had been ""entirely confidential"".However, the Daily Record, which broke the story on Thursday 23 August, later claimed to have seen the wording of an allegation by a Scottish government staff member.It says she alleges Mr Salmond touched her bottom and breasts through her clothing while she was alone with him at at the first minister's official residence, Bute House, in December 2013.Police Scotland has confirmed that it is ""carrying out an assessment of information which we have received and inquiries are at an early stage"".Mr Salmond has strongly denied any claims of harassment or criminality.He also accused someone in the Scottish government of ""sustained leaking"" of the ""most unfair kind"".He said it was ""crucial"" to find out who in government was responsible.The former first minister was told in March this year that allegations had been made against him and he had been assured that the process would be confidential.He claims he has still not been allowed to see the evidence against him.His statement called the procedure ""unjust"" and said he had not been able to properly challenge the case against him.Mr Salmond said the procedure, put into operation by Ms Evans three years after he left office, was ""grossly unfair"" and would lead to prejudicial outcomes.On Wednesday 29 August, Mr Salmond lodged a petition with the Court of Session in Edinburgh seeking a Judicial Review.It will decide the issue of the lawfulness of the procedure.The court will now seek a response from the Scottish government. It is likely to be some weeks before there is a hearing before a judge.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she became aware in April that Mr Salmond was being investigated.In fact, it was Mr Salmond himself that told her.She said she had no prior knowledge of complaints being made against him.Ms Sturgeon said she had taken ""no role in the process"" and not spoken about it publicly because she did not want to compromise the internal investigation.She said the fact that complaints were made could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.""Mr Salmond announced on Wednesday 29 August he was resigning from the SNP.The ex-first minister said he intended to apply to rejoin the party once he had an opportunity to clear his name.He said he was quitting because he wanted to avoid potential divisions within the party, which has faced calls to suspend him.A Judicial Review will consider whether a proper ""decision-making process"" was followed by the Scottish government.It will not look at whether or not the ""correct"" decision was made.  The court will seek to ensure that principles of natural justice and fairness have been followed.Before the review can be heard Mr Salmond must appeal to the Court of Session for permission to proceed.  Permission will only be granted where the Judicial Review has ""a real prospect of success"".  His petition was formally lodged with the court earlier this week, and the Scottish government will now have an opportunity to respond."

The European Union's critics sometimes invoke the presence of tariffs - effectively taxes on imported items - on African goods when they accuse it of being a protectionist club or racket. So how much is there to this?  The relatively simple element is the EU's arrangement for a group of nations known as Least Developed Countries (LDCs.) Of these LDCs, there are currently 33 in Africa - most of the countries on the continent. These ""are low-income countries confronting severe structural impediments to sustainable development"". These countries have duty-free access for their goods to the EU under an initiative known as Everything but Arms (EBA). The same access is also given to Equatorial Guinea, which used to be an LDC country.If it's not a weapon or ammunition, and it is made or grown in one of the countries concerned, it has duty-free access to the EU. If the product is from Ethiopia, Uganda or Malawi, for example, there would be no tariffs. There may be other barriers - such as regulations, product standards and customs documents to complete - but that also applies to goods from other countries outside Europe's single market, including the US, Japan and Canada. None of the three countries the prime minister is visiting - South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya - are on that United Nations list of LDCs. That is probably one of the reasons she chose them. They are bigger economic players and there is more to be gained from commercial relations with them. But all three of them do get some degree of relief from EU trade tariffs. There is an arrangement that covers other developing countries beyond the LDCs. It's known as the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP).  Other rich countries, including the US and Japan operate their own GSPs. The EU's version applies to Nigeria and has benefited Kenya but does not cover South Africa. It doesn't open the tariff-free gates as wide as EBA does. The EU says it gives tariff-free access for 57% of products and reduced rates for most of the rest. But the minority of goods still subject to full tariffs are often farm produce. Both the Everything but Arms and the Generalised System of Preferences are unilateral. The EU simply lowers or eliminates tariffs and the partner country is under no obligation to reciprocate and cut their own tariffs on imports from the EU.But there are wider deals known as Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA). These go further and also mean a country like Kenya opening its market to the EU, though not as much as the EU does. Kenya is part of an EPA through an East African regional group. Kenya has duty-free access on an interim basis until three other countries in the group sign and ratify it so the agreement comes into full effect. South Africa, together with five other countries, has another partnership. The EU says it gives fully or partly duty-free access to 98.7% of imports coming from South Africa.  So there are tariffs that affect some South African goods. And it can get very complicated. For many types of agricultural products there are quotas at zero tariffs. For others there are reduced tariffs on a certain quota and higher duties on quantities above that. Some tariffs vary seasonally - oranges have higher tariffs when the EU crop is available. There are tariffs imposed on specific products from some African countries. Atiku Abubakar, a former vice-president of Nigeria writing in the Daily Express, was concerned about his own country.  Mr Abubakar wrote that refined sugar from Nigeria faces a tariff of more than 300% if it's exported to the EU. The EU tariff on imports of refined white sugar - not covered by any preferential arrangement or a reduced duty quota - is 419 euros per tonne. That probably would apply to sugar from Nigeria as it does not have an EPA and is not eligible for the EU's scheme for the least developed countries.  It is certainly true that the EU's tariffs on sugar are seen as high, although they are nowhere near as high as 300%.But there is another point about the EU's tariffs. Countries that don't face EU tariffs often welcome them being applied to other countries. Dr Peter Holmes of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at Sussex University points out some African sugar producers take that view. Without the tariff they would struggle to compete against the giant of the industry, Brazil.  When Mr Abubakar writes that ""if Nigeria and other African countries could export agricultural products tariff-free to Britain"", the fact is that most of them already can. Moreover Nigeria could get improved access to the EU if it accepted an EPA agreement negotiated with the EU and a group of West African nations. But President Buhari decided not to sign it, saying he wanted to protect the industries that provide jobs for Nigerians. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-09-03,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180903213126/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to Â£40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-03,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180903213126/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

The Brexit supporter said it ""beggared belief"" that the world's sixth-biggest economy should be talking of stockpiling food and medicines.This left the government without a credible bargaining position, he said.""A government that cannot take action to prevent some of these catastrophic outcomes illustrates a whole lack of preparation,"" he said.""It doesn't tell us anything about whether the policy of staying in the EU is good or bad, it tells us everything about the incompetence of the preparation for it.""Lord King said the 11th-hour preparation for a no-deal Brexit had undermined the government's negotiating position. He added: ""We haven't had a credible bargaining position, because we hadn't put in place measures where we could say to our colleagues in Europe, 'Look, we'd like a free-trade deal, we think that you would probably like one too, but if we can't agree, don't be under any misapprehension, we have put in place the measures that would enable us to leave without one.'""He predicts that we will find ourselves with what's been dubbed as Brino - Brexit in name only - which he said was the worst of all worlds. It's also a state of affairs that he fears could drag on for years. ""I think the biggest risk to the UK, and this is what worries me most, is that this issue isn't going to go away, you know the referendum hasn't decided it, because both camps feel that they haven't got what they wanted.""Lord King expressed regret and surprise that it was more difficult for a single country to present a united front than the other 27 EU members.He said: ""They must have been really worried that they had 27 countries to try to corral, how could they have a united negotiating position, they were dealing with a country that was one country, made a clear decision, voted to leave, it knew what it wanted to do, how on earth could the EU manage to negotiate against this one decisive group on the other side of the Channel?""Well, the reality's been completely the opposite. The EU has been united, has been clear, has been patient and it's the UK that's been divided without any clear strategy at all for how to get to where we want to go.""Please upgrade your browserHe also said he found the current level of debate around Brexit ""depressing"" and said it obscured the real challenges ahead.""The biggest economic problems facing the UK are, we save too little, we haven't worked out how to save for retirement, the pension system is facing I think a real challenge, we haven't worked out how to save enough for the NHS and finance it, we haven't worked out how we're going to save enough to provide care for the elderly. ""These are the big economic challenges we face, but are they being discussed at present in an open way? ""No, because the political debate has completely taken up by Brexit,"" he said. ""It's a discussion where both sides seem to be throwing insults at each other.""Lord King might argue he is being much more even-handed, with stinging criticism for all involved.  "
2018-09-04,"UK economy is unjust, says Archbishop",https://web.archive.org//web/20180905014627/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45412543,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Archbishop of Canterbury has called for a fundamental rethink of how the economy works, including more public spending and higher taxes on technology giants and the wealthy.In an interview with the BBC to mark the launch of a major report by the Commission on Economic Justice, of which he is a leading member, Archbishop Justin Welby said the present economy was ""unjust"".He backed demands from the Commission for a new regulator for technology firms, similar to those that oversee public utilities such as energy and water.The spiritual leader of the Church of England said a new regulator would be tasked with ensuring that technology giants such as Google and Facebook were using people's personal data in a way that was socially responsible.""They have enormous power and the use and handling of data has huge implications for people's security,"" he said.""But it also has huge implications for the flourishing of individuals and the prosperity and fairness of our society.""If you corner the market in data, you have probably more wealth advantages than if you corner the market in gold or oil.""Data is the real place where the money is, and we've always said that people with huge power should be regulated.""Archbishop Welby also argued for an increase in the minimum wage to better reflect the cost of living and support struggling families and said that without action, ""bitter resentment"" would grow.The Commission, set up by the left-leaning think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the present ""living wage"", as it is described by the government, should be increased by Â£1 an hour to Â£8.83 for those over 25.It said people on zero-hours contracts should be paid 20% more on top of that figure.It also called for higher levels of corporation tax on businesses, a ""minimum tax rate"" on multinationals such as technology firms to stem ""tax avoidance"" and the scrapping of inheritance tax - to be replaced by a ""lifetime gift tax"" on any gifted income above Â£125,000.The tax would be levied on individuals rather than estates.""People suffer from injustice in the economy,"" Archbishop Welby told me.""People suffer from the need to go to a food bank, even when you've got two adults both working. ""People suffer from being caught in a debt trap, because they can't replace a basic bit of equipment they need like a new stove, a washing machine - let alone have luxuries.""I think one of the regrettable things in the last few years has been to call what we used to call the minimum wage a 'living wage'.""We need a living wage because that enables people to live with dignity, and the dignity of the human being is fundamental to our understanding of what a just economy is about.""The Commission's board members include the Archbishop, as well as: Lord Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, is also a member.The Commission was launched in 2016 after the vote to leave the European Union, which some believe was driven in part by the economic difficulties faced by many millions of people.Its report says that problems in the economy are fundamental and have been building for more than 40 years.Low levels of investment by businesses and the government in anything from a new piece of technology to new digital and transport links have meant that growth has suffered, it said.And low levels of wealth creation, called productivity, have left many millions of people struggling as wages fail to keep up with the increase in prices.""I start with the dignity of the human being which is what I learn from Jesus Christ - the dignity and value of each individual human being, whoever they are,"" the Archbishop said, arguing that he was ""non-political"" and that his was not an attack on any particular government or party, as the problems had long-term roots.He said he had met many politicians who were trying to tackle ingrained problems and that there was much to be optimistic about, including high levels of employment.A government spokesman said: ""Since 2010, we've supported more people into work, introduced the National Living Wage worth Â£7.83 per hour, doubled free childcare and helped workers keep more of the money they earn at the end of every month by cutting taxes for 31 million people by an average of Â£1,000.""The spokesman added the government was spending Â£20bn more per year on the NHS and increasing pay for teachers, nurses and soldiers.Archbishop Welby said there were widespread problems. ""For a lot of people, even if their income has gone up a bit, it's become a lot less secure.""You don't know from one week to the next what you'll be earning.""And so for people trying to budget, people trying to just save a bit so that, I don't know, once a month they could have fish and chips with their kids or go to the cinema or go down to the beach on a nice hot summer, they can't plan.""It comes back to justice and the common good.""I asked the Archbishop if he agreed with the Commission that taxes needed to increase on technology firms and the wealthy.""What is clear is that tax should be a fundamental part of being a citizen, and that those who have the most should pay the most,"" he said.""And that no company, through being multinational, being global, can evade the responsibilities of paying its proper amount of tax, based on the revenues it earns in this country.""So yes, some people will need to pay more.""I'm not going to point at individuals, but certainly we see people and companies that seem not to pay what sounds like a reasonable amount of tax."""
2018-09-04,Labour adopts anti-Semitism definition,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905014627/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45414656,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK Labour Party's ruling body has agreed to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism, after months of rows.It will incorporate all the 11 examples of anti-Semitism cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance into its code of conduct. But Jewish groups have attacked an accompanying statement agreed by the NEC aimed at protecting free speech.One warned it risked giving ""racists a get-out-of-jail card"". After a three hour meeting in London, Labour said its National Executive Committee had adopted all of the IHRA examples of anti-Semitism, including four it left out in July, alongside a statement ensuring ""this will not in any way undermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians"". The party, which has struggled to contain a long-running row over claims of anti-Semitism within its ranks, said it ""welcomed Jeremy Corbyn's statement to the meeting about action against anti-Semitism, solidarity with the Jewish community and protection of Palestinian rights"". Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the NEC decision was a ""clear indication of our direction of travel"" and Labour would now hold a consultation on changing the wording of its code of conduct.She said the party needed ""a comprehensive and legally robust document"" with which to implement action against our members who might breach the IHRA examples and definition.""We need to have a code in place and what we want to do now is re-invite those organisations that we have sought to work with over the last year or so and get their views and really make that code watertight so that it's crystal clear to all of our members what is acceptable and what isn't.""Way out of the mess?By the BBC's political editor Laura KuenssbergPerhaps this marks the beginning of the end of this sorry mess. But what makes an early resolution tricky is the caveat that Labour has included alongside.It will be important to many of Mr Corbyn's supporters who want the right to criticise Israel.But for those campaigning against anti-Semitism, it still sends a message that Labour might want to make exceptions, that the party is saying ""yes, but"", rather than ""yes, of course"", to loud demands from the Jewish community that they take the strongest action possible against those who would foment tension.Rival protesters gathered outside Labour's headquarters as its senior officials discussed the issue.Some activists wrapped in Israeli flags condemned Labour as being ""for the many, not the Jew"" while others urged the NEC to resist calls to adopt the IHRA definition, one carrying a banner stating ""criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitism"". As well as urging the party to adopt the IHRA definition in full with all examples, Mr Corbyn set out some of the concerns Labour members had raised about limitations on freedom of speech in his comments at the NEC meeting.The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understood the Labour leader suggested a more extensive accompanying statement stating that ""it should not be considered anti-Semitic to describe Israel, its policies or the circumstances around its foundation as racist because of their discriminatory impact, or to support another settlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict"" but that this was rejected.The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said this followed a split among left-wing members of the NEC, with Momentum founder Jon Lansman and a Jewish colleague Rhea Wolfson making it clear they did not support their leader's position.The Jewish Leadership Council criticised Mr Corbyn's actions and said the free speech caveats would ""drive a coach and horses"" through the anti-Semitism definition.""It is clearly more important to the Labour leader to protect the free speech of those who hate Israel than it is to protect the Jewish community from the real threats that it faces,"" its chief executive Simon Johnson said.Campaign group Labour Against anti-Semitism said it was disappointed by ""the attachment of a ""clarification"" that risks giving racists in the party a get-out-of-jail card"". And the Board of Deputies of British Jews said ""firm action"" was now needed against anti-Semites in the party and Mr Corbyn should apologise for ""past anti-Semitic comments and affiliations"".There was a mixed response from MPs who have been critical of the leadership over what they say is its failure to get to grips with the problem.Two steps forward and one step back. Why dilute the welcome adoption IN FULL of the #IHRA definition of #Antisemitism with an unnecessary qualification?End of Twitter post  by @margarethodgeThat the NEC has reached the right conclusion is welcome and, frankly, a relief. Weâve got to repair the hurt this row has caused. Letâs root out the racists, put in place training and bust the myth that this decision undermines the cause of Palestinian human rights and statehood https://t.co/8RzWmuB2uGEnd of Twitter post  by @wesstreetingSupporters of Mr Corbyn had argued that adopting the IHRA definition with all examples would restrict freedom to criticise Israel's actions against Palestinians.Labour MP Chris Williamson, an ally of Mr Corbyn, said Jewish opinion was not ""homogenous"" when it came to backing the definition and the party's decision to adopt it was a ""pragmatic"" one.""I don't think Jeremy was isolated in any way, shape or form,"" he told the BBC. ""He set out the position and said it was important, in view of the pressure, the party needed to adopt all the examples not withstanding the criticisms by the original author of them.""He said the development would not prevent Labour activists from criticising the actions of the ""apartheid"" Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and he urged the ""small element obsessed with the issue"" of anti-Semitism within the party to now get behind their leader.

2018-09-04,Sturgeon announces mental health funds,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905014627/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-45395739,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has pledged an extra Â£250m for mental health services as she announced her plans for the coming year at Holyrood.Ms Sturgeon set out details of 12 new bills in her ""programme for government"" as MSPs returned from summer recess.Mental health support for young people and increased capital investment were among the key measures announced.Opposition parties said the government was being too timid, and had failed to follow through on previous promises.Ms Sturgeon said the plans unveiled on Tuesday would see her government ""focused on delivering for today and investing for tomorrow"".At the heart of the programme set out was support for mental health services, with Ms Sturgeon noting that more must be done to ""support positive mental health"" amid rising demand for services.Her speech came on the same day as new figures showed Scotland had recorded its worst ever performance on child and adolescent mental health waiting times.To help tackle the problem, Ms Sturgeon announced Â£250m of funding across the next five years to support mental health services, in particular for young people.This includes Â£60m for schools, supporting 350 counsellors and 250 extra school nurses, to ensure every secondary school has a counselling service.Teachers will be offered mental health first aid training, while the government will develop a community mental wellbeing service for people aged five to 24 and set up a fast-track system for young people with the most serious mental illnesses to get specialist help.Ms Sturgeon said this package ""underlines the commitment of this government to ensuring that our health services value and support mental wellbeing just as much physical wellbeing"".The first minister also announced Â£7bn of capital spending by 2026, with extra investment in infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, transport, digital connectivity and clean energy.She said her government had a ""national mission"" to produce ""a level of investment in our vital economic and social infrastructure that will protect and create jobs in the short term, and support growth and productivity in the long term"".Other pledges included:Opposition MSPs will now have a chance to put forward their priorities, with further debates on the programme for government scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said members would take Ms Sturgeon's plans with ""a gritter-load of salt"", saying the government was much better at making promises than following through on them.She said: ""They had great ambitions but remarkably little legislation has happened - not so much a relaunch, but a retread.""Ms Davidson said education plans were ""an unholy mess, entirely of the SNP's making"", challenging Ms Sturgeon to bring back the Education Bill shelved by ministers before recess.While she welcomed some sections of the speech, such as the focus on increasing exports, support for mental health services and funding for electric vehicles, she said the overall package was characterised by ""knee-jerk, backside-covering just-in-time-ism"".Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard also welcomed the mental health reforms, saying the latest waiting times figures showed ""how potentially important this announcement is"".But he said other things were missing from the programme, such as ""a fair pay deal for Scotland's teachers"" or a cap on agency fees in the NHS.He added: ""Eleven years into the SNP's office where is the vitality? Where is the driving force? Where is the real radical vision in this programme for government?""Over those eleven years the SNP's ambition has not matched this parliament's power. For our part, Labour will welcome use of the powers and always push for a bolder agenda.""The Scottish Greens said the programme was a ""missed opportunity"", and that the response proposed on climate issues was hugely outweighed by the scale of the problem.Co-convener Patrick Harvie said his party would work to push the government ""beyond its comfort zone"", adding that he would not enter budget talks with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay until ""meaningful progress"" had been made on reform of council tax.Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie criticised Ms Sturgeon for raising the issue of Scottish independence early in her speech, saying that it was ""independence first, last and always with the SNP, nothing else matters"".He said there was ""not one note of contrition"" from the first minister over ""failures"" on mental health waiting times, and urged her to back a new referendum on the final terms of the Brexit deal."

Contenders Shahrar Ali and Leslie Rowe received 1,466 and 495 votes respectively. Deputy leader Amelia Womack was re-elected with 3,981 of 7,369 total votes cast.The co-leaders said they wanted the party to be ""the opposite of vapid, old school centrist politics"" by responding to the ""big challenges of our time - from Brexit to climate breakdown and the housing crisis, to automation and the broken world of work"".They also promised ""fiercer Green resistance"" against fracking and the HS2 rail project.""When faced with the environmental destruction of fracking or the spiralling costs of HS2, or the inhumanity of indefinite detention and forced removals of refugees and migrants, we are not afraid to join protestors putting their bodies on the line for what is right,"" Mr Bartley said.Ms Lucas, the party's only MP and its figurehead for many years, was arrested during a fracking demonstration in 2013. By Political Correspondent Chris MasonIn a noisy, polarised political debate, the central challenge for the Green Party is being noticed. It's certainly novel in politics for leaders to have a job share - Jonathan Bartley and Sian Berry see this as a badge of their modernity; such arrangements being commonplace in many other careers. The potential downside for them is the lack of a single figurehead; one face and voice that personifies the party on the public stage.Mr Bartley has led the opposition on Lambeth council since being elected a Streatham councillor in May this year. Ms Berry was elected Green London Assembly member in 2016, when she also came third in the London mayoral race. She has been a Camden councillor since 2014.Ms Womack was re-elected deputy leader of the party for a third term and will continue work on women's rights, including the campaign to make misogyny a hate crime, as well as work on sustainable communities and the environment. The party failed to make its hoped-for breakthrough in the 2017 general election, as its vote was squeezed by Labour. But it made headway in May's council elections, adding eight seats.The new co-leaders said they wanted to see Green representation on every council in England as part of their ambition of becoming the ""third political party"" in Britain.

General Secretary Tim Roache told the BBC ""false promises"" had been made during the 2016 referendum and it was time to ""let the people decide"".But he said that the vote should be on the terms of exit, not on whether Brexit would actually happen, which he said had already been decided.The UK is to leave on 29 March 2019.The cross-party People's Vote campaign, which is backed by the Lib Dems and Greens as well as many Labour MPs, has said a referendum must be held on the outcome of the negotiations with the EU, including the option to remain in the bloc.GMB said it had consulted its 620,000 members before its executive committee chose to endorse the idea of a new referendum.While it respected the outcome of the 2016 Brexit vote, it said the reality facing the British public was very different from what they voted for. ""People voted for change,"" Mr Roache said. ""They voted to take back control. They did not vote for economic chaos or to put jobs and hard-won rights on the line.""""In trade union terms if we negotiate a pay deal for our members we put that deal back to the members and they decide whether that's acceptable or not.""We have no faith given what's happened in the last few months in this government delivering a Brexit deal that works for working people. ""If the government are comfortable with that, well let's let the people decide then.""A number of unions, including the TSSA and Royal College of Nursing, have backed a further referendum although Unite, the country's largest, has so far stopped short of doing so. In July, it said it was ""open to the possibility"" of another EU referendum ""depending on political circumstances"" and its priority was planning for a general election. The Labour leadership has said that a new referendum is not party policy but senior figures have suggested no options should be taken off the table as the negotiations enter a crucial phase and Prime Minister Theresa May attempts to negotiate a deal next month. Mrs May has insisted there will be no new vote under any circumstances and her Chequers plan for Brexit delivers on the result of the 2016 referendum.Updating MPs on negotiations on Tuesday, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said ""dangling"" the prospect of another vote at this stage would invite the EU to give the UK ""the very worst terms""."

""This is the kind of issue where countries that believe in civilised values have to take a stand and make sure that justice is done.""Mr Hunt said he intended to host a ""high-level meeting of ministers"" at the UN General Assembly but acknowledged a referral to the ICC had to come from the UN Security Council, with the backing of the five permanent members. ""At the moment it is not clear that there would be consensus on the Security Council to deliver that.""China, which has a close economic and diplomatic relationship with Myanmar, is expected to try to veto any attempt. Mr Hunt also said he wanted to visit Myanmar and raise the matter with authorities there, including the country's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi who has faced criticism for failing to stop the violence. Last week, the UK urged the Security Council to take ""concerted action"" over crimes committed against Rohingya Muslims, after the UN report called for the country's military leaders to be prosecuted.The report is the strongest condemnation from the UN so far and calls for the case to be referred to the ICC. It names six senior military figures it believes should go on trial and sharply criticises Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.Myanmar has rejected the report and has consistently said its operations targeted militant or insurgent threats. The Rohingya are one of many ethnic minorities in Myanmar but the government sees them as illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh and denies them citizenship."

The international chemical weapons experts reached their conclusions having collected samples from the UK. It was not possible to conclude whether the nerve agent used in the two incidents was from the same batch, the OPCW said.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked the OPCW and paid tribute to the ""high standards set by our world-leading scientists"".He said it was a reminder of the importance of upholding the the global ban on all use of chemical weapons.""The recklessness of the Russian state in bringing a nerve agent in to the UK, and total disregard for the safety of the public, is appalling and irresponsible,"" he added. ""Our thoughts are with the family of Dawn Sturgess, and with Charlie Rowley.""Mr Rowley - a friend of Ms Sturgess - fell ill but survived the poisoning. On 30 June, the couple collapsed in a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from Salisbury.Police said they were exposed after handling what they believed to be perfume.Mr Rowley was discharged from hospital on 20 July.The Foreign Office said police investigations into the Amesbury and Salisbury poisonings were continuing. Meanwhile, the Russian Embassy in London has accused the UK of refusing it access to the Skripals. In a statement marking six months since the pair were admitted to hospital, the embassy said the pair had been ""kept in isolation and under full control of British authorities"".""They remain out of the public eye at an unknown location, unable to communicate freely with their relatives, friends, journalists or Russian officials, deprived of the freedom of movement,"" the statement added.Ms Skripal has previously thanked the Russian embassy for its offer of assistance, but said she and her father were ""not ready to take it""."

Meanwhile, campaigners for the public to have the final say on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations have welcomed the GMB union's decision to come out in favour of a new referendum.The UK will leave the EU on 29 March and negotiations are taking place on the terms of its departure and its future relationship with the remaining members.In July, the UK government published proposals for how trade with the EU could be managed in years to come.It includes a ""common rulebook"" for goods and treating the UK and the EU as a ""combined customs territory"" in an attempt to minimise red tape for businesses and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.But Brexiteer critics - including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson - say this will leave the UK too closely tied to the EU in years to come, and are campaigning for it to be ""ditched"".Addressing MPs, Mr Raab was urged by one Tory backbencher to ""chuck Chequers"" in the face of recent criticism from EU negotiator Michel Barnier.Mr Raab said the European Commission had indeed ""raised concerns"" but that positive feedback had been received from member states.Since the government published its proposals in a White Paper, ministers have held more than 60 meetings with EU counterparts, he said.Mr Raab said the ""scope and contours"" of the agreement covering the UK's withdrawal were clear.This would protect citizens' rights and put in place a temporary transition period after the UK leaves, he added.He also defended the UK's plans for the possibility of no deal being reached, which included publishing 25 notices last month offering advice on how best to prepare for such a scenario, saying: ""The UK will be ready for Brexit, deal or no deal.""Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said his statement would ""reassure nobody"", dismissed the Chequers plan as a ""fudge"" and said there were ""huge gaps"" in the government's plans for no deal, notably on the Irish border.Writing in the Daily Telegraph, former Tory leader Lord Hague warned that disunity in the party could trigger a ""terrible chain of events over the next seven months"".If there is no agreement that can win the backing of the House of Commons, the UK could face a choice of leaving with no deal or deferring Brexit and holding a new referendum, he said.""Either of those outcomes could variously involve more serious economic consequences than anything seen so far, the fall of the Conservative government, a general election, and either the election of the dysfunctional Labour Party or another hung Parliament.""Mr Barnier's objections to the plan were underlined during a meeting with the Brexit committee of UK MPs on Monday.One member of the committee, former Conservative minister John Whittingdale, said it had become clear in the meeting that the EU ""just can't accept"" the Chequers plan, because it thinks it goes against the principles of the single market.Mr Whittingdale, who said he was personally ""very unhappy"" about the PM's plan, said Mr Barnier had instead been open to a free trade deal of ""unprecedented closeness""."

She described the group, which campaigns against proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act (GRA), as a ""far-right transphobic hate group"".Woman's Place UK said it is against all forms of discrimination and Ms Challenor's claim ""undermines the important discussion needed on this issue"".Co-founder Kiri Tunks said the campaign was formed to ensure women's voices were heard on proposed changes to the GRA and its meetings included trans people both on the platform and in the audience.She added: ""We are committed to respectful discussion that respects the rights of all.""Writing about Ms Challenor's suspension in The Guardian, Ms Lucas urged people to find ""a way through the current debate about trans rights that's respectful of one another and the facts"".The 20-year-old pulled out of the party's deputy leader race last week. The Green Party then announced it had suspended her on a no-fault basis while an investigation took place. A party spokesperson said it stood against transphobia in all its forms.""We also believe in the power of dialogue. That means taking time to talk to those who have different perspectives, even those we disagree with, to make progress towards a world where all women are safe.""Ms Challenor's father David had acted as an election agent at the 2017 general election and local elections in May, despite being charged with child rape in November 2016, according to West Midlands Police. He was jailed for 22 years at Warwick Crown Court, where he was found guilty of 20 offences including the rape of a 10-year-old girl. The court was told he held the victim captive in his attic and photographed the abuse as it was carried out. "

And how does the EU defend its strict adherence to its negotiating stance in the light of the scepticism of the EU and sympathy for the UK that many citizens in the EU27 undoubtedly feel?Last week I travelled around Austria in search of answers to those questions. It's one of those countries where there is an Anglophile public and a nationalist right-wing coalition that frequently questions EU policies has recently taken power. It currently holds the rotating chair of the Union's various ministerial committees. As it hosted the foreign ministers get together last week, we were able to canvass opinion.Only Poland's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowizc, arriving at the meeting, seemed responsive to Theresa May's appeal to exert a moderating influence on Mr Barnier's negotiating team. ""We argue for a good deal for both sides. I think it is possible,"" he said, adding, ""I will encourage, my partners within the European Union to be more open to arguments of the UK"". But saying something to the waiting press and repeating that sentiment in the ministers' meeting, breaking ranks with colleagues, are different things of course. His colleague, Poland's Europe minister, did indeed urge moderation of the EU27's position on the Irish border during a recent general affairs council in Brussels. But the stern reaction from his French and German counterparts reportedly squashed the dissenting member pretty quickly.So the first reason for the UK's lack of progress in getting the member states more involved is that none wants to break ranks. In the corridors around European meetings you meet officials from an extensive list of countries who - very privately - express sympathy or support on some aspects of the Brexit negotiation: from the V4 (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia); to the Baltic states and Austria. But none regards Brexit as a first order national problem worth taking a stand for. As for countries like the Netherlands or Italy, where there is certainly a strand of Eurosceptic politics, more substantial ties with the UK, as well as the necessary heft to take a leadership role, mean there is also reluctance. In these countries politicians are putting the survival of the EU and its single market first (in defending its integrity against any British 'cherry picking') - as well as wanting to manage their own voters disenchantment with the European project.It would appear that many European politicians have made a cold calculation that a 'successful' Brexit could create political momentum in their own countries for looser ties with the EU.We visited the Austrian town of Wels, which was taken by the far right Freedom Party after the refugee crisis changed the political weather. There is little actual Euroscepticism in Austria in the sense of people campaigning to leave, but there is widespread voter disenchantment with the EU's refugee policy and the way the Eurozone is run. But even in this industrial town of 60,000 in the province of Upper Austria, there is cold comfort for Downing St.""It is right to be tough,"" Andreas Rabl, the Freedom Party mayor of Wels told us, endorsing the European Commission's negotiating stance. ""If it is possible for countries to exit and enjoy the same advantages as before, when they were still EU members, that would be a fatal signal to all other EU countries"".His party is now trying to impose benefit restrictions on migrants from fellow EU countries that go well beyond David Cameron's 2015 suggested caps. It seems a heavy irony that right wing governments in several European countries might now be ready to back the type of measures that Britain was asking for before the referendum. However as Mr Rabl points out, Austria intends to fight for benefit changes from within - it has no intention of leaving. And so far Austrian courts, acting on European law, have struck down such measures against newcomers from fellow EU states. The new wave of populists may have their own points of difference with the EU but they are hardly going to fritter away the political capital they need in those battles in order to give Britain a soft Brexit deal.Underlining all these factors one gets the sense, when talking to many Anglophile politicians across the continent, that they would rather the UK remained in, and that the best way to do that might be to hang tough on the terms of Brexit in the hope that this causes a change of mind.

But can it be done in a way that satisfies everybody?As Frank Field resigned the Labour whip on Thursday, the inner core of Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) - the ""officers' group""- was preparing to meet to draw up the agenda for what could be a stormy gathering of the full NEC next Tuesday. That meeting is set to become the forum for deciding the party's position on tackling anti-Semitism.In July, Labour adopted a new code of conduct for its MPs and other elected representatives. The new code incorporated the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition of anti-Semitism, which has been adopted by many public bodies in the UK and around the world since it was agreed in 2016.But crucially, say critics of the Labour leadership's stance on this issue, it did not reproduce four of the 11 ""contemporary examples"" of anti-Semitism in public life, cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) as guiding its work.Labour sources maintained that most of the excluded examples were covered by the new code, but had simply been reworded to give them disciplinary force.For instance, the IHRA says that ""Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis"" is an example of anti-Semitism. Labour's code says members should ""resist"" using Hitler or Nazi metaphors and that ""such language carries a strong risk of being prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party"".There was an outcry that not every example had been adopted, not just from some Jewish groups but from many Labour MPs too.The Parliamentary Labour Party - its MPs - is due to be balloted on adopting the complete IHRA document, including all the examples, on 5 September, the day after the NEC meets. While open to further amendments to the new code of conduct, there is one IHRA example of anti-Semitism in particular which Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have been reluctant to adopt: ""Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, eg, by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavour.""They say this would especially restrict the free speech of Palestinians - and the ability to discuss the circumstances around the foundation of the state of Israel.But with Unite's Len McCluskey and Jon Lansman of Momentum (who are usually allies of the Labour leader) now willing to adopt the IHRA examples in full, the Left is not solidly behind the initial position taken by their party leader.It also means there is now a majority on the NEC for full adoption of the IHRA document.Opponents of Jeremy Corbyn will portray this as a setback, and question why he didn't adopt the IHRA's examples earlier.But his supporters are likely to argue that he hasn't been defeated, as at July's NEC meeting it was agreed to continue to consult on Labour's code and that the party has simply changed tack in light of the consultations.Will this detoxify the issue? Well, that may depend on what accompanies the adoption of the IHRA examples.Back in July, the pro-Palestinian MP Richard Burden suggested at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party that it does indeed adopt the IHRA definition and examples in full - but that this, in his words, should be ""IHRA plus"" - the ""plus"" being a statement making clear that criticism of the Israeli government would still be legitimate.He suggested that the party take a similar tack to the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, which held an inquiry into anti-Semitism in 2016.It recommended the adoption of the IHRA definition and examples by all political parties, but with the following addendum:""It is not anti-Semitic to criticise the government of Israel, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent. It is not anti-Semitic to hold the Israeli government to the same standards as other liberal democracies, or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government's policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent.""It is possible the NEC will take this approach.But there are suggestions that more wide-ranging caveats could be added - effectively neutralising the effect of adopting the ""racist endeavour"" example of anti-Semitism.It is possible the IHRA examples sit alongside Labour's code of conduct rather than be formally integrated.And the NEC may make clear that the adoption of the IHRA examples would not lead to the retrospective disciplining of party members.Some Jewish groups which have been outspoken in their criticism of the Labour leadership would be far from satisfied with this outcome.Euan Philipps, from Labour Against Anti-Semitism, has got his retaliation in first.""For the Labour Party to claim that it has re-adopted the IHRA working definition of anti-Semitism then the party would need to ensure that the definition has a functional place within the organisation's disciplinary process,"" he said in a statement.""If it is watered down by caveats and addendums then the party cannot claim that it has been fully adopted. It is a false compromise.""So some caveats could severely weaken the IHRA antidote to this toxic political issue. But there is another possible, if unlikely, outcome next week.Labour sources say there is a ""three-month rule"" at the NEC, which means the party's ruling body cannot return to exactly the same subject for further debate during this period.I'm told at least some of those who oppose adopting all the IHRA examples are considering invoking this - trying to defer the whole issue until the Labour conference in late September. That, of course, would mean that an anti-Semitism row would almost certainly overshadow that event.It's hard to believe that the leadership would welcome this. Some NEC members tell me that as anti-Semitism will now formally be on the agenda it is inconceivable that it won't be discussed.Nonetheless, there could be a procedural wrangle next week before anything of substance is debated. A demonstration is being planned by the Camden Momentum group - which takes a quite different view from Momentum's founder and NEC member Jon Lansman - outside next week's meeting, highlighting differences on the Left over this issue.It doesn't want the NEC to endorse the full IHRA document - and wants any decision to be taken by Labour's rank and file members. Last week the Camden group passed the following motion:""The members elected Jeremy Corbyn. The IHRA definition would return the party to the right which we voted down by a large majority - twice. Therefore, the members, not the NEC, nor the PLP, must decide whether or not to adopt the IHRA examples. WE DEMAND THAT THE DECISION BE PUT TO A VOTE OF ALL LABOUR PARTY MEMBERS'.""Also on the NEC agenda is a discussion of Labour's long-running Democracy Review. Rule changes arising from this review - for example, a further reduction in MPs' influence in nominating future leadership contenders - will be put to next month's Labour conference.But what isn't in the Democracy Review document could be more controversial than what is. The review hasn't called for the mandatory reselection of MPs.But some local constituency parties have been proposing rule changes to the way MPs and parliamentary candidates are selected - and it's likely these will be debated at Labour's conference.They are calling for ""open selections"" - in other words sitting MPs could be challenged by other party members between each scheduled general election. And it's possible that they could get the backing of the influential left-wing Momentum group for this controversial change.Momentum's current position is to reform the existing system of selecting candidates - where MPs aren't automatically challenged.But if Momentum decides to back open selections following a meeting of its leadership on Saturday, it's more likely the Labour conference will do likewise.I'm told there is strong grassroots pressure to do so.The influential Unite union's official policy is also to support the mandatory reselection of MPs.Labour former deputy leader Lord Hattersley has already warned that this could provoke a split.And very senior and current figures in the party are privately warning that while there may not be a huge split, the party could splinter - with a handful of MPs initially sitting as independents in protest.As politicians return to Westminster next week, Jeremy Corbyn will face the twin challenges of how to hold his party together and how to reach a consensus on tackling anti-Semitism."

We received the data through an FOI application - which the Home Office took seven months to process. The BBC's request was only answered after the Home Office was instructed to do so by the Information Commissioner, who intervened when we complained that the department had not replied.The Home Office admits that its delay in some cases has been ""unacceptable"". In the past it has been censured by the Information Commissioner's Office over its slow handling of FOI applications, which the ICO has described as ""extremely lengthy"", ""particularly severe"" and ""inexplicable and unjustifiable"".However Elizabeth Denham, the commissioner, faces criticism from openness campaigners for not taking stronger action over these persistent failings. The Campaign for Freedom of Information says ""the ICO has been asleep on the job"".In the longest case covered by the data obtained, the Home Office replied to a request submitted on 8 September 2015 after nearly 34 months had expired, on 5 July 2018. In another it took 29 months, not answering an inquiry made in September 2015 until February 2018.The figures also show that more than 500 requests made since the 2015 general election have taken longer than six months to be answered.In the period covered by this data, the Home Office received a total of 9,786 FOI applications. Under the law they must be answered within 20 working days, or this can be extended for a ""reasonable"" period if necessary to assess whether the material is exempt from being released. The Information Commissioner expects that all requests should normally be dealt with within 40 working days.In a few instances the lengthy delay appears to stem from the role of special advisers.There were nine requests where special advisers took at least a year between the case being passed to them by officials and finally clearing the response. There are 54 other examples where the special adviser stage of the process took at least six months. But this helps to explain the extreme delays in only a minority of cases. A Home Office spokesman said: ""The Home Office receives a high number of FOI requests, some complex and sensitive. The most recent published statistics show we answered 89% of non-routine requests within the deadline or with a permitted extension. ""However we acknowledge that the delay in some cases was unacceptable.  We have worked with the ICO to improve the department's FOI performance. The ICO has noted that we have made and will continue to make steps to improve.""The department's poor track record has annoyed FOI activists. Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information says the Home Office figures reveal ""industrial scale disregard of their FOI obligations"". He said: ""To have taken over two years to respond to some requests is completely off the charts. They've been allowed to get away with this for a very long time. That suggests the ICO has been asleep on the job.""The ICO states it is establishing a new dedicated compliance and monitoring department. A spokesperson said: ""We recognise that many public bodies deal with sensitive issues and deciding whether to disclose is not always straightforward. That is why we work with organisations, so that their responses to requests can be given more effectively and efficiently.""""However, the Commissioner is confident that public authorities are fully aware of her enforcement powers and her commitment to exercise those powers in appropriate cases."""

2018-09-04,No Labour breakaway,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905014627/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45367473,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEvery avalanche, it is said, starts with a single pebble, and in Westminster terms, Frank Field is a pretty hefty pebble. The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee is one of Parliament's lone wolves - austere and relentless in a series of policy battles stretching back across the decades. On the committee corridor at the Palace of Westminster, he is a formidable figure who has savaged the bosses of Carillion and BHS, been a thorn in the side of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, and, if your memory stretches back across the decades, the scourge of the Maxwell brothers. So is his departure from the Labour whip the beginning of the much predicted split in the party?  Not by design, anyway. Mr Field's departure looks very much like a personal decision. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect for Labour is that he has got unhappy MPs (and there are plenty of them) thinking about their own futures. There are several factors in play.First, if the government does manage to get its plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 through Parliament - and the final proposed boundaries are expected to be published next week - then something close to a general reselection exercise may follow. That provides Jeremy Corbyn's supporters with an opportunity to remove those who don't support their leader. Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) and the party conference will have to approve a set of rules to deal with that eventuality, and the details of those rules, and the level of protection they afford to sitting MPs will be studied very closely by those who fear they are under threat. If the rules look like the vehicle for a purge, there will be trouble ahead, and some Labour MPs will calculate they have nothing to lose. There are also wider concerns about a more general revamp of party structures proposed by the former MP and close Corbyn ally Katy Clark, which would entrench the left's organisational grip. Then there's Brexit. Some of Mr Corbyn's most vocal internal critics are those who believe Labour should now be campaigning for a second referendum.They will be loath to upset the applecart while there is a chance of getting organised, cohesive Labour backing behind a Commons vote which could achieve that - and they will be looking to the forthcoming party conference to see if party policy will change, perhaps on the back of union votes. It follows that they may rethink their position if that vote doesn't materialise and the UK leaves the EU. On the other side of the coin, the four Labour MPs, Frank Field included, who voted with the government and saved it from defeat in a crucial Brexit vote in the Commons in July, have also taken considerable flak; but there are significant electoral dangers in Labour purging its Brexiteers - remember that the seats Labour lost in 2017 were mostly in Leave-voting areas. More dangerous and immediate is the anti-Semitism issue which has dogged Labour through the summer. Crucial votes on Labour's approach to it take place in the National Executive Committee next week, and then the Parliamentary Labour Party, which might defuse, or detonate the whole issue. It is hard to understate the level of fury on both sides of this row, which is why it could easily run out of control. Words have already been spoken which make it hard to imagine the protagonists kissing and making up - but a serious attempt to discipline MPs like Margaret Hodge or Ian Austin, the most vocal critics of Mr Corbyn on this issue, could trigger a walkout by their supporters.What is harder to see is how these different strands of dissent could gel into a coherent breakaway. Take Mr Field. He is not part of any Labour tribe, and he certainly does not fit neatly into the vocal group of Blairite holdouts who are Mr Corbyn's loudest critics. For a start, reflecting his Birkenhead constituency, he's a Brexiteer, so any idea that he's about to line up with Labour's hardcore Remainers at some grand launch ceremony for a new party is a non-starter. And this illustrates a wider point; there are plenty of Labour MPs who don't like Mr Corbyn, but they don't necessarily agree on much else. To work, a new party would have to be more than a lifeboat for shipwrecked careers. It would need a unifying idea under which a critical mass of activists, as well as MPs, could gather (political parties need infantry as well as generals) and it would certainly need to attract people from beyond the Labour Party.That would require devising policies which might attract Tory dissidents like Anna Soubry, as well as Labour figures like Chris Leslie or Chuka Umunna.  And such a party would also require leaders, and here there's another problem - if the 1980s SDP is the model, the possible MP defectors include plenty of Bill Rogers types, but no Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams or David Owen - big, recognisable popular figures.  My guess is the biggest threat to Labour unity is that the case of Mr Field raises the temperature and the pot starts to boil; that deselection threats escalate and that more and more MPs consider their positions.Close Corbyn ally Chris Williamson spent the summer pushing for local parties with MPs who are leadership opponents to deselect their incumbents and choose someone more congenial. Until now, many MPs uncomfortable with the Corbyn leadership have bided their time, but if they sense a real threat to their personal positions - and if the party that nurtured them seems to be changing out of recognition - then the bets may be off. Political parties are held together by more than ideology - for their members they can be a family tradition and a way of life, providing friendships and social life. Those links are hard to break, but there is a sense that for many Labour MPs and members, they are fraying. And across the party divide, the Conservatives, who are developing reselection rumbles and talk of purges of their own, are watching with a combination of opportunism and fear.   "
2018-09-04,Salmond allegation,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905014627/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-45295578,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTwo people have made sexual harassment complaints against Scotland's former first minister Alex Salmond. The complaints, which he denies, relate to his time in office. Why have they come to light now? In November, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #Metoo movement, there were concerns over reports that women at all levels in the Scottish Parliament had experienced harassment.At the same time, MPs at Westminster were accused of intimidating or propositioning young women inappropriately. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for an internal review to be carried out of the Scottish government's procedures for handling complaints in the workplace.As part of that review, a new procedure on handling harassment complaints involving current or former ministers was introduced.Two complaints in relation to Mr Salmond were made in January of this year.According to the Daily Record, they relate to events in 2013 when he was first minister.Scotland's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, informed Mr Salmond on Wednesday 22 August that she was considering the public interest in making the fact of the complaints and investigation publicly known.Mr Salmond, who was Scottish first minister from 2007 to 2014 and oversaw the independence referendum, instigated legal action aimed at preventing the Scottish government revealing details of its investigation but later dropped those proceedings.The next evening, Mr Salmond put out a statement denying claims of harassment and saying he was launching a court action to contest the Scottish government's complaints process.The details of the claims of sexual harassment and who made them have not been officially released.The Scottish government's permanent secretary, Ms Evans, would only confirm that two complaints of sexual harassment had been made against Mr Salmond.The Scottish government insisted the investigation had been ""entirely confidential"".However, the Daily Record, which broke the story on Thursday 23 August, later claimed to have seen the wording of an allegation by a Scottish government staff member.It says she alleges Mr Salmond touched her bottom and breasts through her clothing while she was alone with him at at the first minister's official residence, Bute House, in December 2013.Police Scotland has confirmed that it is ""carrying out an assessment of information which we have received and inquiries are at an early stage"".Mr Salmond has strongly denied any claims of harassment or criminality.He also accused someone in the Scottish government of ""sustained leaking"" of the ""most unfair kind"".He said it was ""crucial"" to find out who in government was responsible.The former first minister was told in March this year that allegations had been made against him and he had been assured that the process would be confidential.He claims he has still not been allowed to see the evidence against him.His statement called the procedure ""unjust"" and said he had not been able to properly challenge the case against him.Mr Salmond said the procedure, put into operation by Ms Evans three years after he left office, was ""grossly unfair"" and would lead to prejudicial outcomes.On Wednesday 29 August, Mr Salmond lodged a petition with the Court of Session in Edinburgh seeking a Judicial Review.It will decide the issue of the lawfulness of the procedure.The court will now seek a response from the Scottish government. It is likely to be some weeks before there is a hearing before a judge.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she became aware in April that Mr Salmond was being investigated.In fact, it was Mr Salmond himself that told her.She said she had no prior knowledge of complaints being made against him.Ms Sturgeon said she had taken ""no role in the process"" and not spoken about it publicly because she did not want to compromise the internal investigation.She said the fact that complaints were made could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.""Mr Salmond announced on Wednesday 29 August he was resigning from the SNP.The ex-first minister said he intended to apply to rejoin the party once he had an opportunity to clear his name.He said he was quitting because he wanted to avoid potential divisions within the party, which has faced calls to suspend him.A Judicial Review will consider whether a proper ""decision-making process"" was followed by the Scottish government.It will not look at whether or not the ""correct"" decision was made.  The court will seek to ensure that principles of natural justice and fairness have been followed.Before the review can be heard Mr Salmond must appeal to the Court of Session for permission to proceed.  Permission will only be granted where the Judicial Review has ""a real prospect of success"".  His petition was formally lodged with the court earlier this week, and the Scottish government will now have an opportunity to respond."
2018-09-04,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905014627/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to Â£40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-04,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905014627/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

2018-09-05,What's the Brexiteers' alternative plan?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905222347/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45423791,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAs Westminster is settling down to the next phase of its collective mild nervous breakdown, the pushback to Brexiteers' criticism of Theresa May's Chequers plan is that the naysayers don't have their own. It's not that far off from saying 'come and have a go if you think you're hard enough'!Or, in more polite terms, the kind that your parents might have advised, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. Those in government are deeply frustrated that they get knocked about by criticism from Brexiteers (and not just Boris Johnson, honest) who are right now engaged in an overt plan to kill off the prime minister's plan, based on months of work,  but are yet to front up with their own proposal. In the coming days, the Brexiteers, organised behind the scenes by that powerful grouping, the ERG, which regular readers here will be very familiar with, have a plan to counter that accusation.I hear from Sunday onwards we should expect several days of carefully planned announcements, almost like a government grid perhaps, where the Brexiteers, with their eyes ruthlessly on their short term prize of ""chucking Chequers"", will lay out an alternative. A roll out of written papers will begin over the weekend, with a big event expected in Westminster on Monday which, if it comes off, would just by chance coincide with Boris Johnson's next newspaper column. Plans, which are in this very febrile environment subject to a whole lot of change, are right now for a push on Sunday to make the argument for a free trade agreement, rather than Chequers.On Monday, we should see an explanation of the Brexiteers' vision for money and migration, and then on Wednesday for solutions to be presented for the crucial Northern Irish border question and other issues like agriculture and fishing. The idea is not, sources say crucially, to put pressure directly on Theresa May to trigger some kind of putsch. But don't be in any doubt, it is a carefully worked-through plan designed to present alternatives to what the government has put on the table, calculated to force the prime minister to ditch the policy. Of course, by publishing their own plans, the Brexiteers' will submit themselves to the same kind of scrutiny that the government itself has. It is one thing, they are well aware, to be merely critics, quite another to commit to alternatives that it's likely Number 10 will waste little time in tearing down. The emerging consensus among Brexiteers seems to be that it is better to present an alternative that will be open to criticism, than face the charge of having no worked out ideas of their own. The idea, when ministers say to MPs 'well it's Chequers or nothing', is their solution can fill in that blank. And to try, notably, to make Theresa May perform a huge U-turn before the Tory conference and admit, whether privately, tacitly, or publicly, that the July settlement simply can't stand.Those involved in designing the ""chuck Chequers"" plan are careful to point out that they would absolutely support the prime minister in shifting position. The condition being, if she does their bidding, they won't seek to damage her further. The political truth is too that while many Brexiteers would be ruthless in trying to achieve their political goal, their aim right now, and this goes for Boris Johnson too, is that the target is changing the policy, not changing the Tory party's leader. Yet for those in government right now, there is no question whatsoever of ditching the Chequers deal. Remember it's only the basis for a negotiation, and it took the government two years (yes two years) to come to that position. And insiders say for all the claims of Chequers being dead, in fact it will to a large extent be part of the eventual deal. In other words, remember, remember, remember Chequers was always a document from which a negotiation would finally start, and inside government there is still a strong belief that elements of it will survive. There's an acknowledgement inside government too that the next few weeks will be extremely testing. But right now, there is not even a sniff that they would be able, even if willing, to give one inch to the Brexiteers. But they are organised, determined and willing to try to force her to move, and might have more in their armoury if the prime minister sticks to her ground.  "

Here's what happened.It was the first Prime Minister's Questions since MPs returned from their summer break - and to no one's great surprise Brexit dominated.Equally predictably, Theresa May tried to make the most of Labour's anti-Semitism row and used a planted question from a Conservative MP to call on Jeremy Corbyn to apologise to the Jewish community before the Labour leader had even got to his feet.Mr Corbyn said there was ""no place for racism in any form"" in his party and society as a whole - ""and that includes the Conservative Party"". ""We were the first country in the world to adopt the definition of anti-Semitism as set out by @TheIHRA"" says the PM #PMQs https://t.co/8IfZN5gq1l pic.twitter.com/ue4RwFvjcsEnd of Twitter post  by @BBCPoliticsHe used all six of his questions to highlight Cabinet splits over the prime minister's Brexit proposals - starting with a quote from International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, who said the chance of a ""no deal"" Brexit was 60/40. Was he right, Mr Corbyn asked the prime minister.Mrs May said she was working to ""get a good deal with the European Union"" but it was also ""right and proper that we should prepare for all eventualities"", including a ""no deal"" Brexit. It was a form of words she stuck to for the rest of her exchanges with Mr Corbyn. She called on the Labour leader to rule out a second referendum.PM: ""We will not have a second referendum"" #PMQs #brexit https://t.co/8IfZN5gq1l pic.twitter.com/rkELX3PMpZEnd of Twitter post 2 by @BBCPoliticsThe Labour leader threw quotes at her from Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Chancellor Philip Hammond warning about the dangers to the economy and Britain's place in the world of a ""no deal"" Brexit, starkly at odds, he suggested, with Liam Fox's attitude.Mrs May quoted the head of the World Trade Organisation who, she told MPs, had said a ""no deal"" scenario ""would not be a walk in the park but it would not be the end of the world"".Mr Corbyn then tried to pin her down on what Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab had meant when he said there were ""countervailing opportunities to a no deal Brexit"".In response she called on him to rule out a second EU referendum again. Mr Corbyn then made a crack about the prime minister's dancing - as seen on her summer trip to Africa. ""She can not keep dancing around all the issues,"" said the Labour leader. Mrs May grinned and pulled a face at him. The PM can't ""keep dancing around the issues"" over #Brexit, says Jeremy Corbyn #PMQs https://t.co/MTFXGTc1B9 pic.twitter.com/4WOUXQxZX6End of Twitter post 3 by @BBCPoliticsPanasonic ""had decided to dance off altogether"", said the Labour leader, and ""relocate to another country"". Had other companies told her they would be doing that as well, he asked.The PM read out a list of businesses she said had ""shown confidence in our economy"" by investing in the UK and had a dig at the Labour leader's shifting positions on the customs union.Mr Corbyn asked if the PM was still planning get a deal with the EU by October. The government was ""working to the timetable of October,"" she told him.The Labour leader quoted former Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King - who has accused the government of ""incompetence"" in Brexit talks - before reaching the climax of his attack.""The Chequers proposal is dead, already ripped apart by her own MPs, when will the prime minster publish a real plan that survives contact with her cabinet and reality and protects jobs,"" he asked. Mrs May repeated her standard line on her Brexit plans and ended with another swipe at Labour's anti-Semitism issues, saying Mr Corbyn ""should be ashamed of himself"".The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, also attacked the prime minister's Chequers plan for post-Brexit trade, claiming it was ""even more unpopular than the poll tax"" had been in Scotland. He said staying in the single market and customs union was the only option to protect jobs.Guinea pigs and dodos: ""Why is the PM gambling with Scotland's future"" over #Brexit? asks @IanBlackfordMP #PMQs https://t.co/8IfZN5gq1l pic.twitter.com/cfs2P9Wzt9End of Twitter post 4 by @BBCPoliticsAndrea Jenkyns said online abuse targeted at a newly-elected Conservative councillor had left her special needs son too scared to leave the house.Here is BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg's take on the session:""Scrappy, tetchy exchanges"" @bbclaurak sums up #PMQs https://t.co/8IfZN5gq1l pic.twitter.com/l45YXWLCTqEnd of Twitter post 5 by @BBCPoliticsBBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy's verdict:I sometimes wonder if anyone would notice if a broadcaster were to substitute one of the previous weeks' PMQs exchanges on Brexit for today's. These formulaic, ritualistic clashes tell us little or nothing about the biggest issue confronting the country. Jeremy Corbyn brandishes the latest unhelpful quotes from cabinet ministers and other big figures. Theresa May says it's all going according to plan and challenges the Labour leader to rule out a second referendum. It's Kabuki dancing for Brexit nerdsâ¦ a rather niche form of, er, entertainment.The former Brexit minister Steve Baker, a long time organiser of the backbench Eurosceptics, asked a deceptively simple question about preparations for a no-deal Brexit - an issue which matters a great deal to the hardcore Brexiters. The answer from the PM was not the point - the aim was to underline how important this party faction thinks those preparations are. It is always hard to gauge the reaction of the troops on either side of the House to another helping of all this, but they were clearly less than ecstatic. If one of these two leaders were a really top parliamentary artist, the other would have been ousted by now. Instead the opposing sides cheered their ritual cheers - and on the Labour side the forced mirth at their leader's quip about the PM ""dancing around"" Brexit issues looked a little embarrassed. The question of the day was probably Meg Hillier's pithy inquiry about cash-strapped schools cutting the number of teaching days. The PM floundered around for a few minutes before grinding out a non-answer about more pupils being in good schools.Sir Vince Cable delivered a nice well-honed question about the process for giving EU nationals resident in Britain the ""settled status"" which will allow them to continue to live here after Brexit. There are 59 pages of guidance, he said, providing ""59 ways of saying no in a hostile environment"".It was a nice piece of parliamentary art, but it produced barely a splash. The PM did not even bother to make some sarcastic quip about the Lib Dem leader's rumoured plans to stand down. Perhaps the strategy is to starve him of publicity by declining to seriously engage with anything he says."
2018-09-05,Review into treating misogyny as hate crime,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905222347/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45423789,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA review is to take place into whether misogynistic conduct should be treated as a hate crime, following Labour MP Stella Creasy's call to change the law.The move was announced during a debate on proposed legislation to criminalise upskirting in England and Wales.The Law Commission will review how sex and gender characteristics are treated within existing hate crime laws and whether new offences are needed.Ms Creasy said it sent a message to ""young women we are on their side"".On Wednesday, MPs approved the Voyeurism Bill, which would ban the taking of unsolicited pictures under someone's clothing, known as upskirting, in England and Wales.Proposals to create a new criminal offence, which is already on the statute book in Scotland, will now be considered by the House of Lords.Ms Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, wanted to amend the draft law to allow judges to take into account whether people convicted of hate crimes against women should get a tougher sentence if it was ""motivated"" by misogyny or if misogyny was deemed to be an aggravating factor. Misogyny involves showing dislike, contempt or ingrained prejudice against women.Justice Minister Lucy Frazer said the Voyeurism Bill was not the right vehicle for seeking such a change in the law but said she sympathised with Ms Creasy's views.She said ministers would fund a review into the ""coverage and approach"" of hate crime laws.""We, as a government, are concerned our hate crime legislation is up to date and consistent.""This review will include how protected characteristics, including sex and gender characteristics, should be considered by new or existing hate crime law.""Ms Creasy said the government's commitment to review existing laws and consider whether there was a need for new offences sent a hugely positive signal.""For the first time we are now saying as a country that misogyny is not a part of life, it is something that shouldn't be tolerated, and it is something we are going to tackle,"" she said.""We have just sent a message to every young woman in this country that we are on their side.""She has called for an extension of a pilot project by Nottinghamshire Police, which has for two years been recording misogynistic behaviour as either hate crime or hate incidents, depending on whether or not it is criminal.Nottinghamshire Police, which has been recording misogyny as a hate crime since 2016, defines misogyny as ""incidents against women that are motivated by the attitude of men towards women and includes behaviour targeted at women by men simply because they are women"".Examples include sexual assault, indecent exposure, groping, taking unwanted photographs on mobiles, upskirting, online abuse, being followed home, whistling, sexually explicit language, threatening/aggressive/intimidating behaviour, and unwanted sexual advances.However, not all hate crimes are criminal offences according to the legal definition."
2018-09-05,Ex-minister's top NHS job questioned,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905222347/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45423788,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour has questioned the choice of a former Conservative health minister to be the next chair of NHS England.Lord Prior, a former Tory MP who served in government between 2015 and 2017, has been named preferred candidate to succeed Sir Malcolm Grant in the role.Paul Williams, a Labour member of the health committee, said he had ""serious concerns"" over the peer's independence and warned of ""politicisation"".But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Lord Prior was ""enormously qualified"".In its role of running the NHS in England, the non-departmental body decides how the health service's annual budget of more than Â£120bn is spent and has day-to-day operational responsibility for the commissioning of services. Lord Prior's emergence as the government's chosen candidate to be its next chair, a decision signed off by Mr Hancock, comes less than a year after fellow Tory peer Baroness Harding was named as chair of NHS Improvement.Dr Williams said the two appointments constituted a ""massive politicisation of the institutions intended to take politics out of the day-to-day running of the NHS"".The MP for Stockton South, a former GP, told the BBC the health secretary appeared to be wanting to ""recruit another politician to run the NHS for him"".""Lord Prior has got experience, he has got expertise but he is a politician,"" he said. ""He is a politician in what should be a non-political role.""Lord Prior, the son of the late Tory cabinet minister Jim Prior, served as a junior minister in the health department under Mr Hancock's predecessor Jeremy Hunt.Before accepting a peerage in 2015, he was, as David Prior, Tory MP for North Norfolk between 1997 and 2001.He is currently chair of University College London Hospital NHS Trust, one of the largest in the country. During long career in public life, he has served as a former chair of the Care Quality Commission and the Norfolk and Norwich University NHS Foundation Trust.Dr Williams said the peer would face ""tough questions"" at a pre-appointment hearing of the cross-party health select committee next week.Although the committee does not have the power to block the appointment, the Labour MP said it should ""show teeth"" and he would have to be personally convinced that the peer would be able to  put political interests aside when making future funding decisions. ""He has not just held the Tory whip in the House of Lords,"" he said. ""He has been a minister. It is going to be very hard for him to say no to Matt Hancock.""NHS England is supposed to be arms length of the Department of Health and political influence. He has to convince us that he will stand firm against political interference.""Lord Prior, he added, should consider resigning the Tory whip for the duration of his chairmanship.Former Tory MP Lord Tyrie recently bowed to demands to sit as an independent after controversy over his appointment as chair of the Financial Conduct Authority. In a statement, Mr Hancock said he believed Lord Prior was the right man for the job and looked forward to working closely with him.""Lord Prior brings huge experience to this important role where he will help deliver the long-term plan for the NHS. He is enormously qualified.""The Tory peer would become only the second chair of the organisation, which began life as the NHS Commissioning Board Authority in 2011. Earlier this summer, the government agreed a real-terms funding increase for the NHS of Â£20.5bn a year over the next five years, representing an average increase of 3.4% every year. Ministers said this must go hand in hand with challenging efficiency and productivity targetsLabour said the settlement did not make up for under-investment in the NHS over the past eight years and a lack of funds or planning for social care.

2018-09-05,Novichok attack Russian 'agents' named,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905222347/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45421445,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTwo Russian nationals have been named as suspects in the attempted murder of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.The men, using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are thought to be officers from Russia's military intelligence service, the PM said.Scotland Yard and the CPS say there is enough evidence to charge the men.Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok in March.Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident in Salisbury.  Police are linking the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June, when Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley became unwell at a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from Salisbury.Ms Sturgess died in hospital on 8 July. Mr Rowley was discharged from hospital on 20 July.Speaking to ITV News on Wednesday, he said he wanted to see the suspects ""brought to justice"".  Speaking in the Commons, Prime Minister Theresa May said the government had concluded, from intelligence provided by UK agencies, that the men were part of the GRU intelligence service. The poisoning was ""not a rogue operation"" and was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state, she said. The two suspects, believed to have been using aliases, travelled on Russian passports and are thought to be aged about 40.The BBC's security correspondent Gordon Corera said he understood the authorities identified the pair ""a while back"" and ""may also know their real names"" and had hoped by not making this information public, they could intercept them should they continue to travel.He said there was little expectation that the pair would end up in a British court, but releasing the evidence would instead add pressure with the intention of ""deterring Russia from doing something similar again"". ""We must now step up our collective efforts specifically against the GRU,"" Mrs May said on Wednesday. She condemned the ""despicable attack"" and promised ""the full range of tools from across our national security apparatus"" would be used to ""counter the threat"" caused by Russia. Responding in a statement, Russia's London embassy called on the British government to ""give up politicised public accusations"".The embassy statement accused the UK authorities of being unwilling to engage with them, by providing additional information about the suspects such as their passport numbers.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the use of military-grade nerve agent on the streets of Britain was an ""outrage and beyond reckless"".The CPS is not applying to Russia for the extradition of the two men, as Russia does not extradite its own nationals.But a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained in case they travel to the EU.Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters the names of the Russian suspects ""do not mean anything to me"".The UK will meet the UN security council to discuss the case on Thursday. Mrs May also said Britain would push for the EU to agree new sanctions against Russia. But BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said many European countries would be ""reluctant to tighten the screw on Russia"", fearing a loss of trade and energy.Sue Hemming, CPS director of legal services, said there was enough evidence ""to provide a realistic prospect of conviction"" and that it was ""clearly in the public interest"" to bring charges.The offences include conspiracy to murder Sergei Skripal; the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, Yulia Skripal and Nick Bailey; the use and possession of Novichok contrary to the Chemical Weapons Act; and causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Yulia Skripal and Nick Bailey.Scotland Yard's Neil Basu, the head of UK counter-terrorism policing, said that Det Sgt Bailey ""continues to make good progress but remains off work"".  Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan MarcusThe decision to identify two named Russian individuals in the Skripal case as agents of the Military Intelligence Service - the GRU -  is a significant development. It raises the level of evidence on which the UK government's charges are based and potentially gives added weight to calls for additional international sanctions against Moscow. This evidence will be presented to the UN Security Council later this week. Already messages have been exchanged between London and Moscow; the British Ambassador there seeing a senior Russian official and a Russian diplomat going into the foreign office here in London. But given that it is highly unlikely that these men will ever face trial, what happens now? The prime minister put her emphasis upon bolstering western democracies' defences - not just in purely military terms, but specifically in countering the powerful intelligence arm of the Russian armed forces, the GRU. Analysis by BBC security correspondent Frank GardnerLess famous than the KGB - or its successor, the FSB - the GRU plays a shadowy but important role in Moscow's strategic plans. It is Russia's military intelligence arm, reporting directly to the defence minister. It has extensive cyber and signals operations and has been accused of hacking and online sabotage. GRU officers are often stationed in embassies around the world and many were expelled after the Salisbury attack in March. Since 2013 Russia's elite Spetznaz (Special Purpose) Special Forces have been part of the GRU's command structure and are believed to have played a part in the annexation of Crimea in 2014. British government officials maintain that the GRU's operations include assassinations both inside Russia and overseas. Sergei Skripal served in the GRU as a military intelligence officer in Afghanistan in the 1980s. In 2006 he was arrested and jailed after reportedly betraying the names of his GRU colleagues to Britain's MI6. In 2010 he was allowed to leave for Britain as part of a prisoner swap, but in the Kremlin's eyes he will always be seen as a traitor. The Metropolitan Police said the two men arrived at Gatwick Airport from Moscow on 2 March and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London.  On 4 March they travelled to Salisbury - having also visited for reconnaissance the previous day - where Mr Skripal's front door was contaminated with Novichok.Officers believe a modified perfume bottle was used to spray the door. The pair flew from Heathrow to Moscow later that night. While traces of Novichok were found in the London hotel room, there is no risk to other guests who were staying at the hotel at the time, police said. They now want to hear from anyone who was a guest there from 4 March to 4 May. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he had been assured there was no risk to public health in London.Police said Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley were later exposed to Novichok after handling a contaminated container, labelled as Nina Ricci Premier Jour perfume.Mr Rowley told police he found the box containing the small bottle and an applicator - all found to be counterfeit - in a charity bin. He tried to put the two parts together and got some of the contents on himself. His partner Ms Sturgess applied some of the contents to her wrists and became unwell. The bottle, with a modified nozzle, had contained a ""significant amount"" of Novichok, Scotland Yard said.Mr Basu said: ""We don't yet know where the suspects disposed of the Novichok they used to attack the door, where Dawn and Charlie got the bottle that poisoned them, or if it is the same bottle used in both poisonings."" But he added that the adapted bottle and packaging made it ""a perfect cover for smuggling the weapon into the country, and a perfect delivery method for the attack against the Skripal's front door"". Mr Basu confirmed the two poisoning cases were related.""It now forms one investigation,"" he said. ""We do not believe Dawn and Charlie were deliberately targeted, but became victims as a result of the recklessness in which such a toxic nerve agent was disposed of."" "

In the letter, leaked to The Daily Telegraph, she says: ""At this stage I am not agreeing to any preferred or final policy change for small or micro businesses.""We should take a final decision following this consultation and informed by the evidence submitted to it.""HM Treasury clearance is required for government's response to this consultation."""

""It won't heal divisions but widen them, it would be angrier, create social unrest and open up a massive opportunity for the populist far right in a way we are seeing elsewhere in Europe and the USA.""Mr Burnham said the alt-right could be pushing the no-deal agenda ""to exploit splits in British society"".However, he also said he was not supporting the People's Vote campaign for a referendum, and only advocated a second vote if the alternative was leaving with no deal.He continued: ""A second vote would further erode trust in Parliament and politicians, but that price is worth paying to stop the catastrophic damage to jobs that would come with a no-deal Brexit.""Mr Burnham, who is campaigning for extra powers to be given to the devolved regions and cities, said the 2016 Brexit referendum result was as much an ""instruction for Westminster to review its relationship with the rest of England"" as a message to Brussels.""If the phrase 'take back control' is to mean anything, it must mean substantial devolution of power and resources out of Westminster to all of the English regions,"" he said.A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: ""As a result of the significant progress made in negotiations, we remain confident we will agree a mutually advantageous deal with the EU."""

But Mr Robbins insisted the package remained ""credible and sensible"".The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Both sides are currently seeking to finalise the terms of withdrawal and agree a statement on future economic and security relations.They hope to get agreement before a summit of EU leaders next month but have acknowledged that this might not be possible until November.However, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said he is ""strongly opposed"" to key parts of the PM's plan, agreed at her country residence in July, arguing it breaches the core principles behind the EU's single market.  And many Tory MPs, including both Leavers and Remainers, have warned that it will leave the UK worse off than if it remained in the EU as it would see the UK sign up to a common rulebook for trade in goods and agriculture without having any say in making those rules. Sir Bill told Mr Robbins, who is giving evidence to the European Scrutiny Committee alongside Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, that ministers had been ""bounced"" into supporting the plan but, due to domestic and European opposition, it was ""now effectively dead"".He urged Mr Robbins, who he described as the ""architect of Chequers"", to ""advise the prime minister to put Chequers out of its misery as it satisfies virtually no-one"".But Mr Robbins, who was the top official in the Brexit department before becoming Mrs May's EU adviser a year ago, said the Chequers agreement remained the government's ""collective position"" and the basis for current negotiations between the two sides. ""Respectfully we disagree with Mr Barnier,"" he said. ""The government's view is that the proposals are a credible, sensible, balance of trying to achieve something which respects the autonomy of the EU and the sovereignty of the UK and provides for a pragmatic relationship with the EU.""Mr Raab dismissed calls by Brexiteers to instead pursue an enhanced Canada-style free trade deal, saying Mrs May's plan was the only one to keep the UK intact.Asked whether he would agree that a deal modelled on Canada's arrangements with the EU took Britain further forward and closer to a deal than Chequers, he said: ""I don't understand why anyone of the Brexit flavouring... would cite that as a credible alternative.""The hearing got off to a heated start after Sir Bill accused No 10 of seeking to prevent Mr Robbins from appearing before them.He said it was ""unacceptable"" that seven months had passed since they first asked Mr Robbins to appear, suggesting that No 10 had only backed down after the committee had issued a summons.Last week, Mr Raab suggested Mr Robbins would not be appearing before parliamentary committees in future since as Brexit Secretary he should be held accountable for the government's position."

The Brexit supporter said it ""beggared belief"" that the world's sixth-biggest economy should be talking of stockpiling food and medicines.This left the government without a credible bargaining position, he said.A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) said that getting a good deal with the EU was ""by far, the most likely outcome"".Lord King said that ""a government that cannot take action to prevent some of these catastrophic outcomes illustrates a whole lack of preparation"". ""It doesn't tell us anything about whether the policy of staying in the EU is good or bad, it tells us everything about the incompetence of the preparation for it.""In a BBC interview to discuss the 10 years since the economic crisis - due to be aired next week - Lord King spent a significant amount of time saying the 11th hour preparation for a no-deal Brexit has undermined the government's negotiating position. He added: ""We haven't had a credible bargaining position, because we hadn't put in place measures where we could say to our colleagues in Europe, 'Look, we'd like a free-trade deal, we think that you would probably like one too, but if we can't agree, don't be under any misapprehension, we have put in place the measures that would enable us to leave without one.'""In response, the government said it was ""focused on negotiating a deal of unprecedented scope and ambition"".""We have already made significant progress,"" the DExEU spokesperson added. ""The vast majority of the Withdrawal Agreement has now been agreed, and we are making further progress on the outstanding separation issues"". But Lord King predicts that we will find ourselves with what's been dubbed as Brino - Brexit in name only - which he said was the worst of all worlds. It's also a state of affairs that he fears could drag on for years. ""I think the biggest risk to the UK, and this is what worries me most, is that this issue isn't going to go away, you know the referendum hasn't decided it, because both camps feel that they haven't got what they wanted.""Lord King expressed regret and surprise that it was more difficult for a single country to present a united front than the other 27 EU members.He said: ""They must have been really worried that they had 27 countries to try to corral, how could they have a united negotiating position, they were dealing with a country that was one country, made a clear decision, voted to leave, it knew what it wanted to do, how on earth could the EU manage to negotiate against this one decisive group on the other side of the Channel?""Well, the reality's been completely the opposite. The EU has been united, has been clear, has been patient and it's the UK that's been divided without any clear strategy at all for how to get to where we want to go.""Please upgrade your browserHe also said he found the current level of debate around Brexit ""depressing"" and said it obscured the real challenges ahead.""The biggest economic problems facing the UK are, we save too little, we haven't worked out how to save for retirement, the pension system is facing I think a real challenge, we haven't worked out how to save enough for the NHS and finance it, we haven't worked out how we're going to save enough to provide care for the elderly. ""These are the big economic challenges we face, but are they being discussed at present in an open way? ""No, because the political debate has been completely taken up by Brexit,"" he said. ""It's a discussion where both sides seem to be throwing insults at each other.""Lord King might argue he is being much more even-handed, with stinging criticism for all involved.  His comments come as Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham calls for Brexit to be postponed, if a no-deal scenario seems likely.In a speech on Wednesday, the former Labour minister will say that although ""a price would undoubtedly be paid in terms of social cohesion,"" a suspension of the process would be necessary to avoid damaging jobs."

It wasn't entirely surprising they ended up there, given that under Mr Corbyn's leadership fears about anti-Semitism have been raised on many, many occasions. But over the summer the mess got deeper and deeper, with new allegations about Mr Corbyn's own views and associations emerging. The definition itself became a totem of whether the party was serious about stamping out prejudice. Finally today, Labour's ruling body agreed they would adopt the whole version, despite the clamour from some protestors outside its meeting. Perhaps this marks the beginning of the end of this sorry mess. But what makes an early resolution tricky is the caveat that Labour has included alongside. It will be important to many of Mr Corbyn's supporters who want the right to criticise Israel. But for those campaigning against anti-Semitism, it still sends a message that Labour might want to make exceptions, that the party is saying ""yes, but"", rather than ""yes, of course"", to loud demands from the Jewish community that they take the strongest action possible against those who would foment tension. And secondly, detractors will point to the statement I'm told Mr Corbyn himself suggested should be included alongside, which incorporated the following line -  ""It should not be considered anti-Semitic to describe Israel, its policies or the circumstances around its foundation as racist because of their discriminatory impact, or to support another settlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict.""That's not so different to one of the clauses that has been at the heart of the summer's dispute. And after hours of argument it was clear that the NEC, the ruling body, simply would not accept it. It's a measure of how serious the problem has become that even with his tight grip on the party, Mr Corbyn didn't get his own way. But his personal desire to preserve that element in the Labour definition will be seen by many of his critics as a sign that he still doesn't get it. There will also still be a consultation on the NEC's decision, as well as many cases of alleged anti-Semitism to resolve. There is still some way to go before the party has a hope of drawing a final line. "
2018-09-05,EU unity on Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905222347/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45409188,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTime and again, the unity shown by the 27 other members of the European Union in the face of Brexit has wrong-footed Downing St. Indeed, Karin Kneissl, the Austrian foreign minister told us in a Newsnight interview, Brexit is ""the only topic [on which] we are as cohesive as we are"".So how can it be that far from splitting the EU, getting member states to exert an influence and soften Michel Barnier's negotiating stance, the UK has managed to unite them to an almost unheard of degree? And how does the EU defend its strict adherence to its negotiating stance in the light of the scepticism of the EU and sympathy for the UK that many citizens in the EU27 undoubtedly feel?Last week I travelled around Austria in search of answers to those questions. It's one of those countries where there is an Anglophile public and a nationalist right-wing coalition that frequently questions EU policies has recently taken power. It currently holds the rotating chair of the Union's various ministerial committees. As it hosted the foreign ministers get together last week, we were able to canvass opinion.Only Poland's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowizc, arriving at the meeting, seemed responsive to Theresa May's appeal to exert a moderating influence on Mr Barnier's negotiating team. ""We argue for a good deal for both sides. I think it is possible,"" he said, adding, ""I will encourage, my partners within the European Union to be more open to arguments of the UK"". But saying something to the waiting press and repeating that sentiment in the ministers' meeting, breaking ranks with colleagues, are different things of course. His colleague, Poland's Europe minister, did indeed urge moderation of the EU27's position on the Irish border during a recent general affairs council in Brussels. But the stern reaction from his French and German counterparts reportedly squashed the dissenting member pretty quickly.So the first reason for the UK's lack of progress in getting the member states more involved is that none wants to break ranks. In the corridors around European meetings you meet officials from an extensive list of countries who - very privately - express sympathy or support on some aspects of the Brexit negotiation: from the V4 (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia); to the Baltic states and Austria. But none regards Brexit as a first order national problem worth taking a stand for. As for countries like the Netherlands or Italy, where there is certainly a strand of Eurosceptic politics, more substantial ties with the UK, as well as the necessary heft to take a leadership role, mean there is also reluctance. In these countries politicians are putting the survival of the EU and its single market first (in defending its integrity against any British 'cherry picking') - as well as wanting to manage their own voters disenchantment with the European project.It would appear that many European politicians have made a cold calculation that a 'successful' Brexit could create political momentum in their own countries for looser ties with the EU.We visited the Austrian town of Wels, which was taken by the far right Freedom Party after the refugee crisis changed the political weather. There is little actual Euroscepticism in Austria in the sense of people campaigning to leave, but there is widespread voter disenchantment with the EU's refugee policy and the way the Eurozone is run. But even in this industrial town of 60,000 in the province of Upper Austria, there is cold comfort for Downing St.""It is right to be tough,"" Andreas Rabl, the Freedom Party mayor of Wels told us, endorsing the European Commission's negotiating stance. ""If it is possible for countries to exit and enjoy the same advantages as before, when they were still EU members, that would be a fatal signal to all other EU countries"".His party is now trying to impose benefit restrictions on migrants from fellow EU countries that go well beyond David Cameron's 2015 suggested caps. It seems a heavy irony that right wing governments in several European countries might now be ready to back the type of measures that Britain was asking for before the referendum. However as Mr Rabl points out, Austria intends to fight for benefit changes from within - it has no intention of leaving. And so far Austrian courts, acting on European law, have struck down such measures against newcomers from fellow EU states. The new wave of populists may have their own points of difference with the EU but they are hardly going to fritter away the political capital they need in those battles in order to give Britain a soft Brexit deal.Underlining all these factors one gets the sense, when talking to many Anglophile politicians across the continent, that they would rather the UK remained in, and that the best way to do that might be to hang tough on the terms of Brexit in the hope that this causes a change of mind.

We received the data through an FOI application - which the Home Office took seven months to process. The BBC's request was only answered after the Home Office was instructed to do so by the Information Commissioner, who intervened when we complained that the department had not replied.The Home Office admits that its delay in some cases has been ""unacceptable"". In the past it has been censured by the Information Commissioner's Office over its slow handling of FOI applications, which the ICO has described as ""extremely lengthy"", ""particularly severe"" and ""inexplicable and unjustifiable"".However Elizabeth Denham, the commissioner, faces criticism from openness campaigners for not taking stronger action over these persistent failings. The Campaign for Freedom of Information says ""the ICO has been asleep on the job"".In the longest case covered by the data obtained, the Home Office replied to a request submitted on 8 September 2015 after nearly 34 months had expired, on 5 July 2018. In another it took 29 months, not answering an inquiry made in September 2015 until February 2018.The figures also show that more than 500 requests made since the 2015 general election have taken longer than six months to be answered.In the period covered by this data, the Home Office received a total of 9,786 FOI applications. Under the law they must be answered within 20 working days, or this can be extended for a ""reasonable"" period if necessary to assess whether the material is exempt from being released. The Information Commissioner expects that all requests should normally be dealt with within 40 working days.In a few instances the lengthy delay appears to stem from the role of special advisers.There were nine requests where special advisers took at least a year between the case being passed to them by officials and finally clearing the response. There are 54 other examples where the special adviser stage of the process took at least six months. But this helps to explain the extreme delays in only a minority of cases. A Home Office spokesman said: ""The Home Office receives a high number of FOI requests, some complex and sensitive. The most recent published statistics show we answered 89% of non-routine requests within the deadline or with a permitted extension. ""However we acknowledge that the delay in some cases was unacceptable.  We have worked with the ICO to improve the department's FOI performance. The ICO has noted that we have made and will continue to make steps to improve.""The department's poor track record has annoyed FOI activists. Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information says the Home Office figures reveal ""industrial scale disregard of their FOI obligations"". He said: ""To have taken over two years to respond to some requests is completely off the charts. They've been allowed to get away with this for a very long time. That suggests the ICO has been asleep on the job.""The ICO states it is establishing a new dedicated compliance and monitoring department. A spokesperson said: ""We recognise that many public bodies deal with sensitive issues and deciding whether to disclose is not always straightforward. That is why we work with organisations, so that their responses to requests can be given more effectively and efficiently.""""However, the Commissioner is confident that public authorities are fully aware of her enforcement powers and her commitment to exercise those powers in appropriate cases."""

The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee is one of Parliament's lone wolves - austere and relentless in a series of policy battles stretching back across the decades. On the committee corridor at the Palace of Westminster, he is a formidable figure who has savaged the bosses of Carillion and BHS, been a thorn in the side of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, and, if your memory stretches back across the decades, the scourge of the Maxwell brothers. So is his departure from the Labour whip the beginning of the much predicted split in the party?  Not by design, anyway. Mr Field's departure looks very much like a personal decision. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect for Labour is that he has got unhappy MPs (and there are plenty of them) thinking about their own futures. There are several factors in play.First, if the government does manage to get its plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 through Parliament - and the final proposed boundaries are expected to be published next week - then something close to a general reselection exercise may follow. That provides Jeremy Corbyn's supporters with an opportunity to remove those who don't support their leader. Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) and the party conference will have to approve a set of rules to deal with that eventuality, and the details of those rules, and the level of protection they afford to sitting MPs will be studied very closely by those who fear they are under threat. If the rules look like the vehicle for a purge, there will be trouble ahead, and some Labour MPs will calculate they have nothing to lose. There are also wider concerns about a more general revamp of party structures proposed by the former MP and close Corbyn ally Katy Clark, which would entrench the left's organisational grip. Then there's Brexit. Some of Mr Corbyn's most vocal internal critics are those who believe Labour should now be campaigning for a second referendum.They will be loath to upset the applecart while there is a chance of getting organised, cohesive Labour backing behind a Commons vote which could achieve that - and they will be looking to the forthcoming party conference to see if party policy will change, perhaps on the back of union votes. It follows that they may rethink their position if that vote doesn't materialise and the UK leaves the EU. On the other side of the coin, the four Labour MPs, Frank Field included, who voted with the government and saved it from defeat in a crucial Brexit vote in the Commons in July, have also taken considerable flak; but there are significant electoral dangers in Labour purging its Brexiteers - remember that the seats Labour lost in 2017 were mostly in Leave-voting areas. More dangerous and immediate is the anti-Semitism issue which has dogged Labour through the summer. Crucial votes on Labour's approach to it take place in the National Executive Committee next week, and then the Parliamentary Labour Party, which might defuse, or detonate the whole issue. It is hard to understate the level of fury on both sides of this row, which is why it could easily run out of control. Words have already been spoken which make it hard to imagine the protagonists kissing and making up - but a serious attempt to discipline MPs like Margaret Hodge or Ian Austin, the most vocal critics of Mr Corbyn on this issue, could trigger a walkout by their supporters.What is harder to see is how these different strands of dissent could gel into a coherent breakaway. Take Mr Field. He is not part of any Labour tribe, and he certainly does not fit neatly into the vocal group of Blairite holdouts who are Mr Corbyn's loudest critics. For a start, reflecting his Birkenhead constituency, he's a Brexiteer, so any idea that he's about to line up with Labour's hardcore Remainers at some grand launch ceremony for a new party is a non-starter. And this illustrates a wider point; there are plenty of Labour MPs who don't like Mr Corbyn, but they don't necessarily agree on much else. To work, a new party would have to be more than a lifeboat for shipwrecked careers. It would need a unifying idea under which a critical mass of activists, as well as MPs, could gather (political parties need infantry as well as generals) and it would certainly need to attract people from beyond the Labour Party.That would require devising policies which might attract Tory dissidents like Anna Soubry, as well as Labour figures like Chris Leslie or Chuka Umunna.  And such a party would also require leaders, and here there's another problem - if the 1980s SDP is the model, the possible MP defectors include plenty of Bill Rogers types, but no Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams or David Owen - big, recognisable popular figures.  My guess is the biggest threat to Labour unity is that the case of Mr Field raises the temperature and the pot starts to boil; that deselection threats escalate and that more and more MPs consider their positions.Close Corbyn ally Chris Williamson spent the summer pushing for local parties with MPs who are leadership opponents to deselect their incumbents and choose someone more congenial. Until now, many MPs uncomfortable with the Corbyn leadership have bided their time, but if they sense a real threat to their personal positions - and if the party that nurtured them seems to be changing out of recognition - then the bets may be off. Political parties are held together by more than ideology - for their members they can be a family tradition and a way of life, providing friendships and social life. Those links are hard to break, but there is a sense that for many Labour MPs and members, they are fraying. And across the party divide, the Conservatives, who are developing reselection rumbles and talk of purges of their own, are watching with a combination of opportunism and fear.   "
2018-09-05,Salmond allegation,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905222347/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-45295578,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTwo people have made sexual harassment complaints against Scotland's former first minister Alex Salmond. The complaints, which he denies, relate to his time in office. Why have they come to light now? In November, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #Metoo movement, there were concerns over reports that women at all levels in the Scottish Parliament had experienced harassment.At the same time, MPs at Westminster were accused of intimidating or propositioning young women inappropriately. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for an internal review to be carried out of the Scottish government's procedures for handling complaints in the workplace.As part of that review, a new procedure on handling harassment complaints involving current or former ministers was introduced.Two complaints in relation to Mr Salmond were made in January of this year.According to the Daily Record, they relate to events in 2013 when he was first minister.Scotland's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, informed Mr Salmond on Wednesday 22 August that she was considering the public interest in making the fact of the complaints and investigation publicly known.Mr Salmond, who was Scottish first minister from 2007 to 2014 and oversaw the independence referendum, instigated legal action aimed at preventing the Scottish government revealing details of its investigation but later dropped those proceedings.The next evening, Mr Salmond put out a statement denying claims of harassment and saying he was launching a court action to contest the Scottish government's complaints process.The details of the claims of sexual harassment and who made them have not been officially released.The Scottish government's permanent secretary, Ms Evans, would only confirm that two complaints of sexual harassment had been made against Mr Salmond.The Scottish government insisted the investigation had been ""entirely confidential"".However, the Daily Record, which broke the story on Thursday 23 August, later claimed to have seen the wording of an allegation by a Scottish government staff member.It says she alleges Mr Salmond touched her bottom and breasts through her clothing while she was alone with him at at the first minister's official residence, Bute House, in December 2013.Police Scotland has confirmed that it is ""carrying out an assessment of information which we have received and inquiries are at an early stage"".Mr Salmond has strongly denied any claims of harassment or criminality.He also accused someone in the Scottish government of ""sustained leaking"" of the ""most unfair kind"".He said it was ""crucial"" to find out who in government was responsible.The former first minister was told in March this year that allegations had been made against him and he had been assured that the process would be confidential.He claims he has still not been allowed to see the evidence against him.His statement called the procedure ""unjust"" and said he had not been able to properly challenge the case against him.Mr Salmond said the procedure, put into operation by Ms Evans three years after he left office, was ""grossly unfair"" and would lead to prejudicial outcomes.On Wednesday 29 August, Mr Salmond lodged a petition with the Court of Session in Edinburgh seeking a Judicial Review.It will decide the issue of the lawfulness of the procedure.The court will now seek a response from the Scottish government. It is likely to be some weeks before there is a hearing before a judge.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she became aware in April that Mr Salmond was being investigated.In fact, it was Mr Salmond himself that told her.She said she had no prior knowledge of complaints being made against him.Ms Sturgeon said she had taken ""no role in the process"" and not spoken about it publicly because she did not want to compromise the internal investigation.She said the fact that complaints were made could not be ignored or swept under the carpet.""Mr Salmond announced on Wednesday 29 August he was resigning from the SNP.The ex-first minister said he intended to apply to rejoin the party once he had an opportunity to clear his name.He said he was quitting because he wanted to avoid potential divisions within the party, which has faced calls to suspend him.A Judicial Review will consider whether a proper ""decision-making process"" was followed by the Scottish government.It will not look at whether or not the ""correct"" decision was made.  The court will seek to ensure that principles of natural justice and fairness have been followed.Before the review can be heard Mr Salmond must appeal to the Court of Session for permission to proceed.  Permission will only be granted where the Judicial Review has ""a real prospect of success"".  His petition was formally lodged with the court earlier this week, and the Scottish government will now have an opportunity to respond."
2018-09-05,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905222347/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to Â£40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-05,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180905222347/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-09-06,Tax cut for self-employed workers scrapped,https://web.archive.org//web/20180906211215/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45439542,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA planned tax cut for 2.7m self-employed workers has been scrapped by the UK government.It was originally due to scrap Class 2 National Insurance contributions in April but the move had been delayed by a year and has now been shelved.It cited concerns that low-earning self-employed people would pay more to access the state pension, and it would make the tax system more complex.Labour's John McDonnell called it a ""betrayal of the self-employed"".The government was originally due to scrap Class 2 NI contributions, paid by self-employed people with profits of Â£6,205 or more a year, in April 2018 but last year announced it was delaying that for a year.But it announced on Thursday that they would not now be abolished in this Parliament.The move was set to save millions of workers about Â£150 a year. But there had been concerns that the move would hit more than 300,000 self-employed people earning less than Â£6,000 a year who were paying the Class 2 NICs voluntarily, in order to access the state pension. They would have faced being moved to Class 3 contributions, raising weekly payments from Â£2.95 to Â£14.65.In a written statement, Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick said the change had been intended to simplify the tax system for the self-employed but it had ""become clear"" that a ""significant number"" of self-employed people with the lowest profits would have ended up paying more.""Having listened to those likely to be affected by this change, we have concluded that it would not be right to proceed during this Parliament, given the negative impacts it could have on some of the lowest earning in our society,"" it said. Trying to address the concerns would have meant ""greater complexity to the tax system, undermining the original objective of the policy"".He added: ""The government remains committed to simplifying the tax system for the self-employed and will keep this issue under review in the context of the wider tax system and the sustainability of the public finances.""But shadow chancellor Mr McDonnell said: ""This is yet another betrayal of the self-employed. These people are the engine of the economy and have been let down again, while giant corporations have seen their tax bills slashed."" The Federation of Small Businesses said it would hit more than three million people and would ""net the Treasury more than Â£350m annually in the three years to 2021"".FSB Chairman Mike Cherry said the Treasury ""should have worked harder"" to find ways to protect low-earners.""The self-employed community has been let down today, missing out on a promise to reduce their tax burden.

2018-09-06,World leaders back UK Novichok allegations,https://web.archive.org//web/20180906211215/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45439388,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed with the UK that the Russian government ""almost certainly"" approved the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury.They have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. At a UN Security Council meeting to discuss the attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". In a lengthy rebuttal, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"".The UK has named two men believed to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, as the main suspects. Theresa May told the Commons on Wednesday that the suspects had entered the UK on Russian passports using the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.She told MPs the poisoning was ""not a rogue operation"" and was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state. The Kremlin called these accusations ""unacceptable"". The statement from Mrs May, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau said: ""We, the leaders of France, Germany, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, reiterate our outrage at the use of a chemical nerve agent, known as Novichok, in Salisbury on March 4.""The leaders welcomed progress in the investigation, but urged those with more information to go to UK authorities. ""We have full confidence in the British assessment that the two suspects were officers from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU,"" the statement added. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries in response to the 4 March attack, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"".The leaders said the link to the Russian service - revealed on Wednesday - would strengthen their intention to work together against foreign spy networks, the use of chemical weapons, and to ""defend ourselves from all forms of malign state activity directed against us and our societies"".The UN Security Council, of which Russia is a permanent member, alongside China and UK allies the US and France, met in New York to discuss the latest progress in the investigation. Addressing the council, Britain's ambassador to the UN Karen Pierce, said the nerve agent attack was a ""direct challenge"" to the ""rules-based international system that has kept all of us safe since 1945"".But Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and UK citizens. ""We have lost all hope in finding the truth,"" he added. Prosecutors in the UK believe there is sufficient evidence to charge the two Russian nationals with offences including conspiracy to murder; attempted murder and the use and possession of Novichok contrary to the Chemical Weapons Act.Russia does not extradite its nationals, but a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained in case the pair travel to the EU.Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned with Novichok on 4 March. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident in Salisbury.  Police have also linked the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in nearby Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess and harmed her friend Charlie Rowley."

He added: ""Let's wait for the transcript and then let's check the sort of things that are reported of what Michel Barnier said against what he actually really said.""Meanwhile, a paper with details of planning for a no-deal Brexit has been caught on camera in Whitehall.It reveals government departments are expected to make cuts in other spending to prepare for the possibility of no deal being reached.Codenamed Operation Yellowhammer, it appears to be run by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, which is responsible for emergency planning.The government says a deal with the EU is the most likely outcome.But it is also making contingency plans for leaving without one, and recently published a series of papers detailing preparations and offering advice.The document, captured by photographer Steve Back, was being carried by Treasury Minister John Glen as he left the Cabinet Office.Downing Street said civil contingencies planning happened routinely in advance of significant events, and that the yellowhammer name had been generated at random.Asked about the document during a visit to Glasgow University, Chancellor Philip Hammond - who has previously warned about the economic impact of no deal being reached - said departments had the funding needed to plan for such a scenario.He added: ""In no deal circumstances we would have to refocus government priorities so that government was concentrated on the circumstances that we found ourselves in.""Let me reiterate again that is not the outcome we are expecting and it's not the outcome we're seeking.""Analysis by BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergAs an intellectual exercise, none of this brief excerpt is completely surprising.But it demonstrates the political reality that in government there is concern about what might happen to the financial system, what might happen to transport, air and rail, but still a message to government departments they should try to find cash to spend on 'no deal' preparations from existing budgets, rather than the big cash pot that's been allocated so far.Read Laura's blog on the leaked paper"

As an intellectual exercise, none  of this brief excerpt is completely surprising.But it demonstrates the political reality that in government there is concern about what might happen to the financial system, what might happen to transport, air and rail, but still a message to government departments they should try to find cash to spend on 'no deal' preparations from existing budgets, rather than the big cash pot that's been allocated so far.That could give yet another reason for Brexiteers to get riled. But in this hot political climate, that's not hard to do. The Treasury officially won't comment on the leak.Here is the text of the snap, captured by the sharp-eyed Westminster photographer @politicalpics:HMT briefing - Operation Yellowhammer - 04 September 2018Operation Yellowhammer: no deal contingency planning Summary of issueâ¢This meeting will consider progress on the Government's plans for mitigating the immediate impacts of a No Deal Brexit.â¢The Civil Contingencies Secretariat held a two-day workshop last week to review departments' plans, assumptions, interdependencies and next steps. HMT objectives1.Emphasise the importance of building XWH [cross Whitehall] communications architecture that can help maintain confidence in the event of contingency plans being triggered - particularly important for financial services.2.Explain that departments should be raising Yellowhammer costs through the normal channels - through their spending teams for in-year pressures, and in their bids for 19/20 Brexit allocations for spending that year. Their first call should be internal prioritisation.3.Reaffirm the need for consistent planning assumptions across plans [â¦] aviation and rail access to the EU.4.Remind departments of the need to consider the financial [â¦] commercial firms that play a role in their contingency plans."

Karen Bradley has also ruled out calling a fresh Assembly election and she is to bring forward legislation to allow civil servants to make decisions in the absence of devolution.MLA pay will fall in November from Â£49,500 to Â£35,888.The cut will happen in two stages. The first cut of Â£7,425 will be followed by a further reduction of Â£6,187 in three months' time.The pay cut was first suggested last December in a report written for the Northern Ireland Office by the former Assembly chief executive Trevor Reaney. He recommended a pay cut until a functioning executive is restored.Ms Bradley made the announcement in the House of Commons.She told MPs: ""The reduction will take effect in two stages, commencing in November - it would not reduce the allowance for staff as I do not think that MLAs' staff should suffer because of the politicians' failure to form an Executive.""She also spoke about the issue of civil service decision making in the absence of an Executive.The secretary of state told MPs: ""I recognise that there is a need to provide reassurance and clarity to both the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the people of Northern Ireland on the mechanisms for the continued delivery of public services.""So, the legislation I intend to introduce after the conference recess will also include provisions to give greater clarity and certainty to enable Northern Ireland departments to continue to take decisions in Northern Ireland in the public interest and to ensure the continued delivery of public services.""Alliance party leader, Naomi Long, tweeted her approval of the announcement. Not before time https://t.co/6IkwCGhWx0End of Twitter post  by @naomi_longMeanwhile, DUP leader Arlene Foster issued a statement which said: ""The proposal to reduce the pay for MLAs is a sensible step as we are not able to fulfil our full role as legislators.""The Secretary of State is right to guard against cuts to the pay and allowances for Members' staff.""The secretary of state also ruled out calling an election as she is required to do under current legislation.   She told MPs: ""I have not believed and do not now believe that holding an election during this time of significant change and political uncertainty would be helpful or would increase the prospects of restoring the Executive.""She added: ""I intend, therefore, to introduce primary legislation in October to set aside for a limited and prescribed period the legal requirement to propose a date for a further election.""Northern Ireland's system of government, where power was shared between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, collapsed after a row over a flawed green energy scheme.DUP leader Arlene Foster was the minister at Stormont's Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) when it set up the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme in 2012, and in that role she signed off on the project.Critical flaws in the scheme meant that claimants of the scheme could earn substantial returns at the taxpayer's expense.The most recent estimate put the projected overspend at Â£700m over 20 years, up from an original figure of Â£490m.That led to a snap assembly election on 2 March 2017, which saw the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in re-emerge as the largest parties, but so far they have been unable to reach a deal to restore the institutions.A big sticking point is Sinn FÃ©in's demand for legislation to give official status to the Irish language in Northern Ireland.The party has been frank and forthright in its insistence that Stormont will not get up and running again until a standalone act is agreed.Other issues, including rights for same-sex couples to marry also feature high on the agenda.Ms Bradley is to have discussions with the local parties and the Irish government in the weeks ahead about political talks aimed at restoring devolution.The secretary of state said she would also seek the parties' views ""on when and how external facilitation"" should be used.There have been a number of calls for an independent talks chairperson to be appointed.Ms Bradley said ""a functioning North-South Ministerial Council is vital to ensure NI makes the most of its unique position within the UK and in relation to Ireland."""

Ms Brown, he said, was acting for ""pecuniary advantage"" and consequently had possibly been committing a criminal offence.Mr Williams said Mr Blaxendale, was not suitable for a job as a caseworker or receptionist. He claimed the AM's brother had no qualifications and ""was not capable of doing the job"".Ms Brown ""simply wanted to employ him as he was her brother and so that he could have a good income"", he added.In his statement, Mr Williams said he was on the interview panel that did not appoint Mr Blaxendale, following a six month probationary period. The ex-advisor said his access to Ms Brown's emails was revoked the following working day. Mr Williams said she also cut him ""out of all future arrangements and would not speak with me"" as a result of concern over his ""performance"" despite there being no previous concerns about his work. He was later suspended and dismissed from his role.Mr Williams said in the statement that Michelle Brown had stated that she dismissed him because it was found he had made derogatory remarks about her to a third party and had breached the assembly's code of conduct. He said she did not know about this when she removed his email access.Under cross-examination, Mr Williams said he had told Ms Brown in conversations several times that he believed she was committing offences under the Fraud Act, but he admitted that was not included in any of the documentation he sent her.Michelle Brown's lawyer told Mr Williams the case against him - which had led to his dismissal for gross misconduct - was that he had communicated via email with the UKIP official David Soutter, someone who she had expressly told him not to contact on many occasions.Mr Williams said he was in touch with Mr Soutter about party matters rather than assembly matters, and he disputed that Ms Brown had made it clear to him that he should have any contact with him. The tribunal will continue on Friday."

The Preseli Pembrokeshire AM had been interim leader of the 12-strong Senedd group, the second largest after Labour. Celebrating his victory, Paul Davies said: ""To the members from right across Wales who put their trust in me - thank you - I will not let you down.""He described leading Conservative assembly members as an ""absolute privilege"" and said it was ""now time for us to raise our game"".Welsh Conservative chairman Byron Davies told activists at Ffos Las racecourse, Carmarthenshire, on Thursday that Mr Davies won a postal ballot of party members by 68.1% of the votes to 31.9% on a turnout of 52%. Mr Davies warned it ""cannot be healthy for our democracy"" for Labour to win the next assembly election in 2021.""If they win a sixth consecutive term at the next election, they'll be close to 30 uninterrupted years of power,"" he said.""We have a duty at the next assembly elections to offer the people of Wales a progressive, innovative and, yes, radical alternative to more of the same.""But the new leader admitted the Welsh Conservatives had ""gone backwards"" at both the 2017 general election and the 2016 assembly poll.The party needed to be ""ready for the political fight of our lives"", he said, adding: ""Before we can transform our country we must first transform our party.""Mr Davies acknowledged a lack of diversity amongst Welsh Conservative politicians, saying: ""Our elected ranks are not sufficiently representative of the whole of Wales.""He pledged a ""genuinely diverse slate"" of candidates at the 2021 assembly elections, admitting it was ""still extremely worrying that the Conservative Party, which introduced many of the great reform acts has never had a female MP in Wales"". During the leadership campaign, Mr Davies said he would be open to the idea of a coalition with other parties to wrest power from Labour.Speaking to BBC Wales following his victory, he said: ""My door is always open.""But he added: ""I've also made it clear that if there is a coalition deal on the table, then our members will have the final say on that.""Prime Minister Theresa May offered her congratulations, saying she looked forward to working with the new leader and his team ""as they hold Labour's failing Welsh Government to account"". ""There has never been a more vital time to do this, and I know that Paul will do a fantastic job speaking up for the Welsh people,"" she added.Conservative Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns praised what he called the ""enthusiasm, ideas and close collaboration"" he would bring to the role. Paul Davies succeeds Andrew RT Davies, who quit the leadership of the group in June saying he felt he had lost the support of his colleagues.  Leadership election campaigns have been sparked in all four main Welsh Assembly parties this year.In August, UKIP named Gareth Bennett as the winner of a grassroots ballot for Senedd group leader over his predecessors Neil Hamilton and Caroline Jones.Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood faces a three-way battle with Adam Price and Rhun ap Iorwerth for her leadership of the party this month, while later this year Welsh Labour will elect a successor to Carwyn Jones, who is stepping down as leader and first minister in December."
2018-09-06,Government criticised over problem debt,https://web.archive.org//web/20180906211215/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45420449,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWeaknesses in the government's strategy for managing personal debt is raising costs to the taxpayer, according to the National Audit Office.Struggling to pay debts makes people more likely to end up in state-subsidised housing, the body says. It also leads to anxiety and depression, which adds to NHS costs.But the government has a ""limited"" understanding of the impact of debt, and there was a lack of co-ordination between departments, the NAO said.""Problem debt has significant consequences both for individuals and the taxpayer,"" said Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO.The government's attempts to address the issue so far had been ""insufficient"", he added.Funding pressures might also be leading to debts being pursued ""too quickly and aggressively"" the NAO said, thus exacerbating their impact.The NAO said its modelling estimates suggested that ""intimidating actions and additional charges"" for those in debt increased the likelihood of mental health problems. There are 8.3 million people struggling with personal debt in the UK, it said.Problem debts to government, largely over council tax or benefits, have become the biggest issue reported to Citizens Advice in the last five years.The NAO estimates the cost of problem debts to the taxpayer as follows:But it adds that the wider costs to the economy of problem debts, such as increased dependency on a wide range of public services, informal care, and lost employment, run to Â£900m.Frank Field MP, chairman of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, said the level of private debt owed to government was ""a sorry indictment of the benefits policy"".Lower earning families are being locked ""into a miserable cycle of debt and hunger, easy prey to loan sharks and forced to resort to food banks"", he added.An HM Treasury Spokesperson said it was taking action on problem debt: ""We're increasing funding for the Money Advice Service to over Â£56m enough to help over 530,000 people get the debt advice they need. ""We're also introducing a breathing space from problem debt to give people time to get their lives back on track.""HM Treasury has formal responsibility for managing these debts, but the NAO says it has limited information, does not fully understand the problem, and cannot respond effectively. Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said: ""The Treasury needs a better understanding of the scale of people's debt problems and how it is impacting their lives and the taxpayer so it can effectively resolve the problem."" Joanna Elson OBE, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said: ""We need to see a new cross-government strategy to tackle problem debt - which brings together the work of government departments, agencies and regulators into a single, coherent approach. The NAO says the way government bodies try to collect debts can end up being counter-productive.It said its analysis had found that ""intimidating actions and additional charges"" were 15% to 29% ""more likely to make debts harder to manage and increase levels of anxiety or depression.""""We found examples of good practice, but it is not adopted consistently. ""For example, established best practice in how to assess the affordability of repayments, promoted by The Money Advice Service, is used by only 19% of local authorities and is not used as standard by government departments,"" it added.Research by the debt charity StepChange  found that more people felt they were treated unfairly by local authorities than by payday lenders. Treating debtors fairly, it estimated, could lead to creditors saving an average of Â£730 per person.StepChange CEO Phil Andrew said: ""The National Audit Office hits the nail on the head.  ""Poor debt collection practices that fixate only on getting as much money back as quickly as possible are counter-productive and ultimately harmful. ""The government is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul, as the wider implications of government debt collection practices are costing taxpayers almost a quarter of a billion pounds every year."""

The scheme, which would run during a transition period after the UK leaves the EU, was announced by the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.Ministers stressed that the pilot will be closely monitored and could close if there is evidence migrant workers were not returning to their home countries when their visas expire.The government said that more automated harvesting solutions will be used on British farms in the future. But it said the industry needed to remain competitive, and almost all OECD countries currently use seasonal workers to pick fruit and vegetables.Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the pilot's operation will be reviewed to see how best to support the longer-term needs of the farming industry.""We have listened to the powerful arguments from farmers about the need for seasonal labour to keep the horticulture industry productive and profitable,"" he said. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""This pilot will ensure farmers have access to the seasonal labour they need to remain productive and profitable during busy times of the year.""Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers' Union, said growers will take great confidence in knowing that they will have access to workers next year after ""extremely testing and uncertain times"".She said the scheme was a ""recognition from the government that British horticulture is a successful, thriving sector which faces some unique challenges but is capable of producing more great, healthy British fruit and vegetables"".The UK's first seasonal agricultural workers scheme was introduced following labour shortages after World War Two.The most recent version covered workers from Romania and Bulgaria but ended five years ago when when restrictions on nationals of the two countries working in the UK stopped.

2018-09-06,The Brexiteers' alternative?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180906211215/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45423791,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAs Westminster is settling down to the next phase of its collective mild nervous breakdown, the pushback to Brexiteers' criticism of Theresa May's Chequers plan is that the naysayers don't have their own. It's not that far off from saying 'come and have a go if you think you're hard enough'!Or, in more polite terms, the kind that your parents might have advised, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. Those in government are deeply frustrated that they get knocked about by criticism from Brexiteers (and not just Boris Johnson, honest) who are right now engaged in an overt plan to kill off the prime minister's plan, based on months of work,  but are yet to front up with their own proposal. In the coming days, the Brexiteers, organised behind the scenes by that powerful grouping, the ERG, which regular readers here will be very familiar with, have a plan to counter that accusation.I hear from Sunday onwards we should expect several days of carefully planned announcements, almost like a government grid perhaps, where the Brexiteers, with their eyes ruthlessly on their short term prize of ""chucking Chequers"", will lay out an alternative. A roll out of written papers will begin over the weekend, with a big event expected in Westminster on Monday which, if it comes off, would just by chance coincide with Boris Johnson's next newspaper column. Plans, which are in this very febrile environment subject to a whole lot of change, are right now for a push on Sunday to make the argument for a free trade agreement, rather than Chequers.On Monday, we should see an explanation of the Brexiteers' vision for money and migration, and then on Wednesday for solutions to be presented for the crucial Northern Irish border question and other issues like agriculture and fishing. The idea is not, sources say crucially, to put pressure directly on Theresa May to trigger some kind of putsch. But don't be in any doubt, it is a carefully worked-through plan designed to present alternatives to what the government has put on the table, calculated to force the prime minister to ditch the policy. Of course, by publishing their own plans, the Brexiteers' will submit themselves to the same kind of scrutiny that the government itself has. It is one thing, they are well aware, to be merely critics, quite another to commit to alternatives that it's likely Number 10 will waste little time in tearing down. The emerging consensus among Brexiteers seems to be that it is better to present an alternative that will be open to criticism, than face the charge of having no worked out ideas of their own. The idea, when ministers say to MPs 'well it's Chequers or nothing', is their solution can fill in that blank. And to try, notably, to make Theresa May perform a huge U-turn before the Tory conference and admit, whether privately, tacitly, or publicly, that the July settlement simply can't stand.Those involved in designing the ""chuck Chequers"" plan are careful to point out that they would absolutely support the prime minister in shifting position. The condition being, if she does their bidding, they won't seek to damage her further. The political truth is too that while many Brexiteers would be ruthless in trying to achieve their political goal, their aim right now, and this goes for Boris Johnson too, is that the target is changing the policy, not changing the Tory party's leader. Yet for those in government right now, there is no question whatsoever of ditching the Chequers deal. Remember it's only the basis for a negotiation, and it took the government two years (yes two years) to come to that position. And insiders say for all the claims of Chequers being dead, in fact it will to a large extent be part of the eventual deal. In other words, remember, remember, remember Chequers was always a document from which a negotiation would finally start, and inside government there is still a strong belief that elements of it will survive. There's an acknowledgement inside government too that the next few weeks will be extremely testing. But right now, there is not even a sniff that they would be able, even if willing, to give one inch to the Brexiteers. But they are organised, determined and willing to try to force her to move, and might have more in their armoury if the prime minister sticks to her ground.  "
2018-09-06,All-female government,https://web.archive.org//web/20180906211215/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45117794,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMen have been cleared out of government and the women are in charge. That's the premise of a play, opening on Thursday, which has been collectively written by a group of leading female figures. The Assemblywomen by the Greek playwright Aristophanes was first written in 391 BC.Back then, a play about the women of Athens dressed as men (complete with fake beards) storming the Assembly and taking charge was seen as a totally unrealistic premise.Indeed, that was one of the reasons it worked as a comedy - and made for the perfect vehicle for the playwright to criticise the Athenian government at the time. Now, a group of leading female figures - among them poets, writers, comedians, broadcasters and politicians - have given the show a makeover, and the newly-titled Women in Power opens this week.Director Sam Hodges says the current political and social turmoil was the catalyst for bringing back a play which he describes as ""deeply resonant"" today.But things have, of course, changed dramatically since it was first written. Many leading female figures now spring to mind in the world of politics and public service.There's Prime Minister Theresa May. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The Commissioner of the Met Police, Cressida Dick. German Chancellor Angela Merkel.But the fact that a select few names always spring to mind is precisely why more progress needs to be made, argues Labour MP Jess Phillips, who's written Women in Power's opening scene.""You couldn't name all the men who are in power in the world right now could you?"" she asks BBC News.The backbencher adds the number of women in power will only be noteworthy when ""we can no longer list them because it's just the norm and there are so many"".""We're noticing it because it's a good thing, but the FTSE 100 companies, there's like 10 women out of 100, so we're still a very long way off.""(It's actually even fewer than that, seven out of 100 of the CEOs are women - there are more men called David or Steven in the top 100 then there are women.)But in the media and entertainment landscape, women are starting to have much more visibility.All female line-ups are very much in fashion, whether it's on panel shows or in Hollywood films like Ocean's 8 and Ghostbusters.Not everyone is happy about such things of course - the Ghostbusters trailer became the most disliked in YouTube history, while some critics said Ocean's 8 wouldn't have been as successful if it hadn't piggy-backed on a male franchise.On Monday, the BBC's new political show Politics Live took some viewers by surprise with its all-female line-up.Presenter Jo Coburn presided over a panel which included former home secretary Amber Rudd and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, alongside the corporation's political editor Laura Kuenssberg.While something unimaginable in Aristophanes's day may well now be seen as progressive - not all viewers were happy.The Daily Mail, The Guardian and The Daily Express picked up on the backlash to the all-female panel, with many on social media criticising ""woke producers"" for putting political correctness and virtue signalling ahead of editorial values. Editor Rob Burley  defended the show on Twitter, writing that he had ""literally zero shame"" about having an all-female panel.Similarly, Women in Power is a play which will likely have some people rolling their eyes at what could be perceived as yet another example of men being actively removed or excluded from a project.Comedian Shappi Khorsandi, who has also written a scene for the show, has some sympathy for the position many modern men find themselves in, adding that they shouldn't feel threatened by pro-women projects such as this.""It will be a real shame if [men feeling attacked] put them off coming, because in a play, things are longer, more nuanced, more humorous, and with actors, you can see the whites of their eyes, you have a connection,"" she says.""Men are in a difficult position in some ways. On the one hand, we're all up in arms about mental health - the fact that the biggest killer of men under 50 is suicide. And yet, on the other, we're peddling this narrative of white middle class men having no right to an input.""So on the one hand we're like, we've got to listen to them all, on another we're telling them to shut up.""Phillips adds: ""It's not intended to attack men. I don't hate men, I've got two sons for god's sake. I love men.""But the fact of the matter is there's still a massive equality imbalance. And if men feel under attack, all that is is a bit of their privilege being chipped away. ""And that's okay, they should want to share it. They should want what they have, whether it's economic stability or personal safety, to be shared. It's not an attack, it's an equalisation.""Writer Wendy Cope, comedian Jenny Eclair and broadcaster Natalie Haynes are among the other names to have contributed scenes to Women in Power.The play, though humorous, explores some quite serious and nuanced themes about the differences between the ways men and women operate, and the merits of each.""The big difference with men and women is that women form alliances,"" says Khorsandi.""They form unbreakable bonds and pacts with one another, and they get into gangs and cliques. And the pressure with women is to be a friend or a foe. ""Whereas men disagree, they argue, they fall out, they have philosophical differences, but they put them down and have a beer together afterwards. They separate emotional attachment from debate.""Phillips adds: ""If women were to be completely in power for even just a month in the UK, there would be a huge change in the decisions that get made.""""I think women are better at taking risks in lots of places. I think women are much more likely to work with each other to try and find a way through. ""In my experience, women work across barriers and assess humanity in a different way in politics... they would be able to progress things quicker because we're much more likely to work together to get a common goal. ""So yeah I think it would potentially be more efficient. It would also potentially just be pleasant. It would stop being about who's the best and start being much more about the country.""So, is Phillips' reason for getting involved in writing the play an attempt to further boost her profile, perhaps a result of leadership ambitions herself?""Oh god no, I'm just useless at saying no to things,"" she laughs, ""which is a very female trait!""Women in Power opens on Thursday at the NST City (at the Nuffield Southampton Theatres), and moves to the Oxford Playhouse in October."

2018-09-06,EU unity on Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180906211215/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45409188,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTime and again, the unity shown by the 27 other members of the European Union in the face of Brexit has wrong-footed Downing St. Indeed, Karin Kneissl, the Austrian foreign minister told us in a Newsnight interview, Brexit is ""the only topic [on which] we are as cohesive as we are"".So how can it be that far from splitting the EU, getting member states to exert an influence and soften Michel Barnier's negotiating stance, the UK has managed to unite them to an almost unheard of degree? And how does the EU defend its strict adherence to its negotiating stance in the light of the scepticism of the EU and sympathy for the UK that many citizens in the EU27 undoubtedly feel?Last week I travelled around Austria in search of answers to those questions. It's one of those countries where there is an Anglophile public and a nationalist right-wing coalition that frequently questions EU policies has recently taken power. It currently holds the rotating chair of the Union's various ministerial committees. As it hosted the foreign ministers get together last week, we were able to canvass opinion.Only Poland's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowizc, arriving at the meeting, seemed responsive to Theresa May's appeal to exert a moderating influence on Mr Barnier's negotiating team. ""We argue for a good deal for both sides. I think it is possible,"" he said, adding, ""I will encourage, my partners within the European Union to be more open to arguments of the UK"". But saying something to the waiting press and repeating that sentiment in the ministers' meeting, breaking ranks with colleagues, are different things of course. His colleague, Poland's Europe minister, did indeed urge moderation of the EU27's position on the Irish border during a recent general affairs council in Brussels. But the stern reaction from his French and German counterparts reportedly squashed the dissenting member pretty quickly.So the first reason for the UK's lack of progress in getting the member states more involved is that none wants to break ranks. In the corridors around European meetings you meet officials from an extensive list of countries who - very privately - express sympathy or support on some aspects of the Brexit negotiation: from the V4 (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia); to the Baltic states and Austria. But none regards Brexit as a first order national problem worth taking a stand for. As for countries like the Netherlands or Italy, where there is certainly a strand of Eurosceptic politics, more substantial ties with the UK, as well as the necessary heft to take a leadership role, mean there is also reluctance. In these countries politicians are putting the survival of the EU and its single market first (in defending its integrity against any British 'cherry picking') - as well as wanting to manage their own voters disenchantment with the European project.It would appear that many European politicians have made a cold calculation that a 'successful' Brexit could create political momentum in their own countries for looser ties with the EU.We visited the Austrian town of Wels, which was taken by the far right Freedom Party after the refugee crisis changed the political weather. There is little actual Euroscepticism in Austria in the sense of people campaigning to leave, but there is widespread voter disenchantment with the EU's refugee policy and the way the Eurozone is run. But even in this industrial town of 60,000 in the province of Upper Austria, there is cold comfort for Downing St.""It is right to be tough,"" Andreas Rabl, the Freedom Party mayor of Wels told us, endorsing the European Commission's negotiating stance. ""If it is possible for countries to exit and enjoy the same advantages as before, when they were still EU members, that would be a fatal signal to all other EU countries"".His party is now trying to impose benefit restrictions on migrants from fellow EU countries that go well beyond David Cameron's 2015 suggested caps. It seems a heavy irony that right wing governments in several European countries might now be ready to back the type of measures that Britain was asking for before the referendum. However as Mr Rabl points out, Austria intends to fight for benefit changes from within - it has no intention of leaving. And so far Austrian courts, acting on European law, have struck down such measures against newcomers from fellow EU states. The new wave of populists may have their own points of difference with the EU but they are hardly going to fritter away the political capital they need in those battles in order to give Britain a soft Brexit deal.Underlining all these factors one gets the sense, when talking to many Anglophile politicians across the continent, that they would rather the UK remained in, and that the best way to do that might be to hang tough on the terms of Brexit in the hope that this causes a change of mind.

We received the data through an FOI application - which the Home Office took seven months to process. The BBC's request was only answered after the Home Office was instructed to do so by the Information Commissioner, who intervened when we complained that the department had not replied.The Home Office admits that its delay in some cases has been ""unacceptable"". In the past it has been censured by the Information Commissioner's Office over its slow handling of FOI applications, which the ICO has described as ""extremely lengthy"", ""particularly severe"" and ""inexplicable and unjustifiable"".However Elizabeth Denham, the commissioner, faces criticism from openness campaigners for not taking stronger action over these persistent failings. The Campaign for Freedom of Information says ""the ICO has been asleep on the job"".In the longest case covered by the data obtained, the Home Office replied to a request submitted on 8 September 2015 after nearly 34 months had expired, on 5 July 2018. In another it took 29 months, not answering an inquiry made in September 2015 until February 2018.The figures also show that more than 500 requests made since the 2015 general election have taken longer than six months to be answered.In the period covered by this data, the Home Office received a total of 9,786 FOI applications. Under the law they must be answered within 20 working days, or this can be extended for a ""reasonable"" period if necessary to assess whether the material is exempt from being released. The Information Commissioner expects that all requests should normally be dealt with within 40 working days.In a few instances the lengthy delay appears to stem from the role of special advisers.There were nine requests where special advisers took at least a year between the case being passed to them by officials and finally clearing the response. There are 54 other examples where the special adviser stage of the process took at least six months. But this helps to explain the extreme delays in only a minority of cases. A Home Office spokesman said: ""The Home Office receives a high number of FOI requests, some complex and sensitive. The most recent published statistics show we answered 89% of non-routine requests within the deadline or with a permitted extension. ""However we acknowledge that the delay in some cases was unacceptable.  We have worked with the ICO to improve the department's FOI performance. The ICO has noted that we have made and will continue to make steps to improve.""The department's poor track record has annoyed FOI activists. Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information says the Home Office figures reveal ""industrial scale disregard of their FOI obligations"". He said: ""To have taken over two years to respond to some requests is completely off the charts. They've been allowed to get away with this for a very long time. That suggests the ICO has been asleep on the job.""The ICO states it is establishing a new dedicated compliance and monitoring department. A spokesperson said: ""We recognise that many public bodies deal with sensitive issues and deciding whether to disclose is not always straightforward. That is why we work with organisations, so that their responses to requests can be given more effectively and efficiently.""""However, the Commissioner is confident that public authorities are fully aware of her enforcement powers and her commitment to exercise those powers in appropriate cases."""
2018-09-06,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180906211215/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to Â£40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-06,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180906211215/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign.

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

""It is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back? I don't know,"" he said. Mr Corbyn responded: ""I think Tony should recognise that party membership is now much bigger than it has ever been.""Asked about his predecessor's comments, the Labour leader added: ""I've been in the Labour Party all my life. I am a socialist. I am determined to see a fairer and more equal society.""That's what the Labour Party exists for. We're there for human rights. We're there for social justice. We're there for the future of the people of this country.""It's not personal, it's about us as a movement. That's why we were founded. That's why the party is so big. And that's why I'm so confident that we are continually challenging this government and we will win a general election.""Mr Blair's invention comes as two more Corbyn critics lost no-confidence votes by local party members in their constituencies. Joan Ryan and Gavin Shuker dismissed the votes - which carry no official force in the party - and said they would carry on as usual, with Ms Ryan blaming ""Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard-left"" for the 94-92 vote defeat.Others to have lost similar votes include Frank Field, who quit the parliamentary party last week citing the handling of the anti-Semitism row and bullying in local constituency parties and Kate Hoey. Graham Stringer won a confidence vote in his constituency.Chuka Umunna, a leading member of the cross-party People's Voice campaign for a second EU referendum, has written to members of his local Labour Party in Streatham, south London, to deny reports that he is involved in talks about a new party, the New Statesman reports.Speaking on Nick Robinson's Political Thinking Podcast, Mr Blair said: ""I don't think the British people will tolerate a situation where, for example, the choice at the next election is Boris Johnson versus Jeremy Corbyn.""I don't know what will happen and I don't know how it will happen. ""But I just don't believe people will find that, in the country as a whole, an acceptable choice. Something will fill that vacuum.""He said there was a large constituency of voters who backed ""socially liberal, progressive"" politics but also believed in ""a strong private enterprise sector alongside a state that is capable of helping people"".Mr Blair's name has been linked with the formation of a new ""centre ground"" party, although he has never publicly backed the idea.And the former prime minister told Nick Robinson he was not as pessimistic as some of the people around him about the chances of his wing of the party regaining control of Labour.""There [are] lots of people associated with me who feel that the Labour Party is lost, that the game's over,"" he said.""I am hoping they are not right.""But he said the anti-Semitism row that had engulfed the party was ""bad because it has been, in the end, something that I just can't imagine ever having happened in the Labour Party that I joined"".""I can't imagine that we have had three to four months debating over something where we have profoundly insulted the Jewish community in our country,"" Mr Blair said.He said the current Labour leadership came from a left-wing tradition opposed to Western foreign policy. Those belonging to that tradition had always been ""on the margins"" of the party or in a different party, such as the Communists or ""Trotskyist groups"", he added.Mr Blair is a persistent critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership and warned in 2015 the Labour Party risked ""annihilation"" if he became leader. Last year he told the BBC he accepted it was ""possible"" that Mr Corbyn could become prime minister, in the wake of the 2017 snap election in which Labour defied predictions of a heavy defeat.Under Mr Corbyn's leadership, party membership has swelled from 388,000 at the end of 2015, to a reported 540,000 as of April 2018. Under Mr Blair's leadership it reached a peak of 405,000 in 1997 before falling to 198,000 by the time he left Downing Street.Labour backbencher Chris Williamson, an ally of Mr Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't really understand what Tony is talking about, the Labour Party now has never been more united. ""We achieved nearly 13m votes in the last election and we are giving hope to millions of people who had become really cynical about politics and inspiring people in a way that I never witnessed in my 42 years as a Labour Party member. ""So I think the party is going frankly from strength to strength."" And Jon Lansman, founder of the pro-Corbyn Momentum movement, said the party would ""never"" return to Mr Blair's policies.He said on Twitter: ""Tony Blair was never in the right party and there will never be a return to his politics in UK Labour.""The National Executive Committee member said that Blair-era policies like the minimum wage and Sure Start nurseries should be credited to other leaders.""Sure Start thanks to Gordon Brown, Min Wage thanks to John Smith, the tragic lost leader we should have had as PM in 1997,"" he wrote."
2018-09-07,Ministers plan divorce law overhaul,https://web.archive.org//web/20180907212446/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45452146,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDivorce laws in England and Wales are set to be overhauled under government plans seeking to allow couples to split up more quickly and with less acrimony.Justice Secretary David Gauke, who has said the system creates ""unnecessary antagonism"", is to begin a consultation on introducing ""no-fault"" divorces.Campaigners said it could be a ""landmark moment"" for divorce law.In July, a woman's appeal for divorce was rejected by the Supreme Court due to her husband's refusal to split.Tini Owens, 68, from Worcestershire, wanted to divorce her husband of 40 years on the grounds she is unhappy. Her husband Hugh has refused the split and the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the appeal, meaning she must remain married until 2020.Under the current law in England and Wales, unless people can prove their marriage has broken down due to adultery, unreasonable behaviour or desertion, the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's consent is to live apart for five years.The government's proposals - first reported by Buzzfeed - could see the concept of fault, or blame, removed from the process. Spouses could lose the right to contest a divorce, as part of the reform.By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondentPressure has been building for decades for a system of no-fault divorce. The Law Commission recommended it in 1990 and many senior judges favour it.  The reason? Many believe that when divorcing couples are being torn apart emotionally and financially, and trying to make living arrangements for their children, assigning blame to one party can only exacerbate an already stressful process.  No-fault divorce would have been introduced in a 1996 Act of Parliament requiring spouses to attend ""information meetings"" to encourage reconciliation, but following pilot schemes, the government decided it was unworkable. The Ministry of Justice will seek to end the right of spouses to contest a divorce, and also consult on how long the parties need to wait before becoming entitled to one, suggesting a minimum of six months.  Essentially, the government is proposing a notification system where, after a defined period, if one spouse still maintains the marriage has broken down irretrievably, they become entitled to a divorce.  There will be some who fear such a system will undermine marriage, but many believe it could remove a layer of stress and anxiety from one of life's most traumatic experiences.Speaking in the House of Lords, Baroness Vere of Norbiton said the call for reform after recent judgements had been noted and the lord chancellor was ""sympathetic"" to the argument for reform.""We are looking at ways to reduce conflict in a divorce, whether that can be no-fault, whether that can be under financial provisions, whether that can be for enforceable nuptial agreements,"" she added. Nigel Shepherd, chairman of the national family lawyer's organisation Resolution, said that couples had been forced ""into needless acrimony and conflict"" under the current system, ""to satisfy an outdated legal requirement"".""Today's news has the potential to be a landmark moment for divorce law in England and Wales,"" he said.""The government appears to have heeded our calls to make our divorce system fit for the modern age, and we will continue to push for this much-needed, overdue reform to be implemented as soon as possible.""However, shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said: ""Instead of yet another consultation, the Conservatives should get on with changing our divorce laws so that they are fit for the 21st century.""Labour was ""fully committed"" to introducing no-fault divorce proceedings, he added.Jenny from Kent got divorced five years ago. Her husband divorced her on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour because it was quicker than waiting for a no-fault divorce.""I would have been quite happy to wait for the two years so that we could have had a no-fault divorce,"" she told Radio 5 live. ""The people that got caught in the middle of this were my two children because they went from seeing their parents talking and being quite amenable to each other to having real arguments and being quite nasty to each other - purely because of the process.""Law Society president Christina Blacklaws said it was time to bring divorce law ""into the 21st century"".In Scotland, a simplified divorce procedure is available (to couples without children of the marriage under 16) where people can prove their marriage is broken down with one year's separation - with consent of both partners - or two years separation without consent.In Northern Ireland, the grounds for divorce are the same as the current requirements for England and Wales. When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following five reasons:Source: Gov.UK"
2018-09-07,Cable to quit 'once Brexit resolved',https://web.archive.org//web/20180907212446/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45438907,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSir Vince Cable will stand down as Lib Dem leader ""once Brexit is resolved or stopped""- and wants non-party members to vote for his replacement.In a speech, Sir Vince set out plans to transform the party into a ""movement for moderates"".Party sources say he wants to see this delivered while he is still leader and wants to stay in his job for crucial Brexit developments.He also wants to continue campaigning for a second EU referendum.""He has a set of objectives rather than a timeline,"" a senior Lib Dem source said. The Lib Dems have 12 MPs - down from the 57 they had in 2010. The party has struggled electorally since 2010, when it formed a coalition government with the Conservatives and remains in single figures in the opinion polls.Sir Vince has predicted a realignment of British politics, as Labour and the Conservatives split over Brexit and it is thought he wants to ensure the Lib Dems, who are campaigning for a second EU referendum, are well placed to work with any new ""centre ground"" groups.The former business secretary told an audience in Westminster: ""I think we have to recognise that despite our best efforts, the Liberal Democrats might not be the only centre force in British politics. ""I think it is the worst kept secret in Westminster that political disquiet in the two major parties, is provoking some people to consider a new party of the centre ground, or several. And I think this requires us to demand better than the usual tribalism, whether that is our own or others.""Sir Vince added: ""Liberal democracy itself is under threat notably in the USA, in eastern Europe and perhaps here. Authoritarians and extremists of both right and left are on the march."" Analysis by Chief Political Correspondent Vicki YoungSome Conservative and many more Labour MPs feel increasingly ill-at-ease with the direction their party is going in. There have been conversations over summer barbecues about creating a new party, or breaking away from the old ones but there's certainly no agreement about what happens next.             Tony Blair and Sir Vince Cable share the belief that there are millions of voters on what they call the centre ground who feel homeless. Sir Vince is offering to put a roof over their heads - but it's hard to imagine dozens of Labour MPs sidling over to the Liberal Democrats. The tribal nature of British politics is deeply ingrained.    Sir Vince's answer is to open up his party to outsiders in an attempt to attract a broader range of support and maybe a different pool of political talent. He seems to be saying to those who share his liberal values and his anti-Brexit stance, that he can supply the vehicle for their journey.But without an obvious figurehead, it's hard to see how these disparate voices can become more than a crowd of disillusioned politicians, grumbling about the status quo.     The Twickenham MP said he wanted to transform the Liberal Democrats from what he called ""an old-style political party"" into a ""movement for moderates"" and had held discussions with some unnamed Labour and Conservative MPs. He advocated a change to the party's rules, so someone who was not an MP could be leader, and ""liberal minded"" people could sign up to the Lib Dems for free and get the right to vote for the leadership.He said he did not want to follow in the footsteps of Liberal prime minister William Gladstone, who served into his 80s - or fellow octogenarian leader Robert Mugabe but added: ""Reports I have read of my imminent departure are very wide of the mark.""Now is not the time for an internal election, there is serious work for me and the party to do.""Once Brexit is resolved or stopped, that will be the time to conduct a leadership election under the new rules.""His proposed changes would have to be approved by party members and will be discussed at their conference in Brighton later this month.Sir Vince took over as leader in July 2017 without a contest following the resignation of Tim Farron.The Liberal Democrats had 99,200 members as of August 2018. The Labour Party changed its membership rules under Ed Miliband from an electoral college system in which union members, MPs and party members had one-third of the vote each to a ""one member one vote"" system, which allowed ""registered supporters"" to take part for a Â£3 fee. Labour's membership swelled in 2015 and it is thought to have had about 540,000 members as of April 2018, up from around 190,000 in 2014.But there were claims that the new rules were fuelling ""entryism"" - allowing other groups to infiltrate the party in an effort to promote their own agenda.It is thought that Sir Vince plans to rewrite the rules so that supporters need to be enrolled for 12 months before voting, to prevent infiltration by rival parties."

""I think actually Karen Bradley was giving an honest answer about what she understood about Northern Ireland before she came in here""Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017 after a bitter row between the governing parties, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in.On Thursday Mrs Bradley announced that she intended to cut Stormont Assembly members' pay.Karen Bradley has also ruled out calling a fresh Assembly election and she is to bring forward legislation to allow civil servants to make decisions in the absence of devolution.MLA pay will fall in November from Â£49,500 to Â£35,888.In her interview with House Magazine she said: ""I had no idea how wonderful Northern Ireland was. I was slightly scared of Northern Ireland because of my impression and images from 20 years ago.

""As friends we will continue to support our four children in the years ahead.""We will not be commenting further.""Mr Johnson and Ms Wheeler, a barrister, married in 1993 and have four children together, Lara Lettice, Milo Arthur, Cassia Peaches and Theodore Apollo. He was previously married to Allegra Mostyn-Owen, a fellow student at Oxford.News of the split follows newspaper allegations about Mr Johnson having had another extra-marital affair.In 2004, the MP was sacked from a shadow ministerial role by then Conservative leader Michael Howard for allegedly lying over an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt - something he had denied as an ""inverted pyramid of piffle"". He fronted the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum and joined Theresa May's first cabinet as foreign secretary but quit in July, shortly after his fellow cabinet Brexiteer David Davis resigned, over the prime minister's Chequers plan for the UK's future relationship with the EU.In 2016, following David Cameron's resignation, Mr Johnson dramatically ruled himself out of the race to be the next Conservative leader and prime minister, after his fellow Brexit campaigner Michael Gove's surprise announcement that he would run.But the former mayor of London and current MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip is widely thought to continue to harbour leadership ambitions.Conservative MP and digital industries minister Margot James, who has criticised the former foreign secretary in the past, said:  ""It is infuriating how Boris Johnson is continuously in the news. ""The prime minister has a really difficult job to do, with the Brexit secretary, to get the best possible deal for this country out of the EU negotiations.""I'm frankly fed up with talking about Boris Johnson"".

2018-09-07,Corbyn critics lose no-confidence votes,https://web.archive.org//web/20180907212446/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45445297,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTwo Labour MPs who lost no-confidence votes among local party members have told constituents they will not quit.Former minister Joan Ryan, the MP for Enfield North, blamed the 94-92 vote defeat on ""Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard-left"".Luton South MP Gavin Shuker said he was ""sorry a handful of people"" wanted to overturn his 2017 win.Both are among MPs to have criticised Jeremy Corbyn and faced no confidence votes in their local parties.Others include Frank Field, who quit the parliamentary party last week citing the handling of the anti-Semitism row and bullying in local constituency parties, Kate Hoey, who has voted with the government on Brexit, and another Brexit-backing Labour MP Graham Stringer, who won his no confidence vote.In July, Momentum's national co-ordinator Laura Parker suggested Ms Hoey, Mr Stringer, Mr Field and John Mann - who also backs Brexit - should be deselected, saying there was ""no room"" for them in the party.No confidence votes carry no official force within the Labour party but local activists could hold a ""trigger ballot"", where sitting Labour MPs can be forced to compete for selection as a candidate against all-comers, ahead of the next general election.Ms Ryan, who chairs the Labour Friends of Israel group and has been critical of Mr Corbyn, said on Twitter: ""Just to be clear, I am not resigning. I am Labour through and through and I will continue to stand up and fight for Labour values.""She added that losing 92 to 94 votes was ""hardly a decisive victory"": ""It never occurred to me that Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard left would [have] confidence in me. I have none in them."" Mr Shuker tweeted a message to his constituents: ""It's not part of any formal procedure, so it changes nothing about my role as Labour MP for Luton South.""I'm really sorry a handful of people in the Labour Party want to overturn your vote of confidence in me last year. Their actions say far less about me - and you - than they do about the face of today's Labour Party.""I've not changed, but the Labour Party has."" Earlier, Labour peer Lord Blunkett said that both he and former deputy leader Lord Hattersley had complained to the party's general secretary about the activities of Corbyn ally Chris Williamson, who he said was putting some MPs under ""enormous pressure"" with threats of deselection.Mr Williamson has been travelling around Labour constituencies with other prominent supporters of Mr Corbyn to make the case for greater democracy and accountability within the party - has rejected claims he is it to push for the removal of critics of the party leader.But Lord Blunkett told the BBC: ""It would be better if he would spend time in Conservative seats fighting the Tories or defending the very tiny majority he has in Derby North, rather than deselecting his colleagues,"" Lord Blunkett told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Lord Blunkett called on ""decent people in the Labour Party"" to ""stand up and take action"".Earlier, former Labour prime minister Tony Blair told the BBC it was a ""different type of Labour Party"" under Jeremy Corbyn adding: ""Can it be taken back? I don't know.""""There are lots of people associated with me who feel that the Labour Party's lost, that the game's over. I'm kind of hoping they're not right.""In response to Mr Blair's comments, a spokesman for the Labour Party said it was ""giving a voice and hope to communities that have been held back and ignored for years"".""Our policies to end austerity and bring water, energy and rail into public ownership are popular and reflect the mainstream of public opinion."""
2018-09-07,SNP MP 'will continue to appear on RT',https://web.archive.org//web/20180907212446/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-45445848,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAn SNP MP has insisted he will continue to appear on the RT channel despite his party's Westminster leader describing it as a ""tool of the Russian state"".Angus MacNeil said the best way to counter propaganda was to go on and give a ""counter message"". Speaking on Radio Scotland, he added: ""Many people have issues with the BBC, but I am talking to it right now.""He did not directly answer whether he believed that Russia was responsible for the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Mr MacNeil was speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme the day after the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, told the programme it was clear Russia had been responsible for an ""act of state terrorism"" and called for tougher sanctions to be imposed. Mr Blackford also said it was ""now clear what the Russian authorities have been up to in the United Kingdom"", and urged people to ""think very carefully about being seen"" on RT.Mr MacNeil has appeared on the channel in the past, as have MPs from all of the main parties, and is an ally of former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who hosts a weekly show on RT. The Western Isles MP heavily promoted Mr Salmond's recent crowdfunding appeal, which raised Â£100,000 to pay for his legal action against the Scottish government over its handling of sexual misconduct claims that have been made against him. Mr Salmond strongly denies the allegations. When asked whether he would now stop appearing on RT, Mr MacNeil replied: ""No, I will talk to any media. Many people have issues with the BBC but I am talking to the BBC just now and I will talk to any media at all if it is there and possible.""He later added: ""I think it is above my pay grade to go around and to be able to hold inquiries into every media channel.""The UK government says there is clear evidence that two members of Russia's GRU military intelligence service were responsible for the novichok attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury on 4 March. Both recovered after spending several weeks in hospital.Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident, while the attack was linked to a separate novichok poisoning on 30 June which led to the death of Dawn Sturgess.Russia has described the evidence of its involvement which had been presented by the UK as ""lies"".Mr MacNeil, who is a member of Westminster's joint committee on national security strategy, said: ""Some people might have clear evidence of the work of the secret services of many countries, perhaps even the UK.""He was asked whether he believes what the UK government has been saying about Russian involvement in the Salisbury attack, He responded: ""The best way to counter anybody's propaganda is to go on and put a different message, and perhaps a difficult message for them as well, and not let them carry on with their propaganda. ""Because if we only talk to our friends all we will have is a single unitary voice ,that is very much in a very narrow segment of society, so I think we have to have broader voices.""If that is happening with Russia, get onto RT and say that is happening so that their propaganda, if that is the case, is not as easily put because you put a counter message on RT and not just the message that perhaps the Russian government will like to hear on RT.""Another of Mr MacNeil's SNP colleagues, Glasgow South MP Stewart McDonald, has faced criticism from some independence supporters on Twitter after questioning the decision by former Scottish Socialist MSP Tommy Sheridan to host a show on the Russian-owned Sputnik radio station. Mr McDonald, who is the SNP's defence spokesman, has also been highly critical of Mr Salmond's RT show, and has previously written that there was a ""prima facie case that Russia has sought to exploit Scottish independence as part of a wider push to destabilise western institutions"".He has also previously said an independent Scotland would stand up to Russia and would have backed Theresa May's stance over the Salisbury attack."
2018-09-07,Councils under financial strain,https://web.archive.org//web/20180907212446/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45435368,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAway from the permutations of Brexit negotiations, ongoing leadership jostling and racism rows a less discussed debate continues a lot closer to home: the future of local government finances. As English councils strive to balance their yearly budgets, keep reserves stocked and plan future savings any service that can be cut is at risk. It has meant fewer bin collections, fewer libraries and - come the next Beast from the East - fewer roads that will be gritted. Instead, legal obligations dictate councils must fund certain aspects of adult social care and children's services - both of which are in high demand and very expensive.    Nationally, the overall financial picture is stark.The Local Government Association, the umbrella body for all councils, says by 2020 councils will have faced a reduction of core funding since 2010 of nearly Â£16bn - a loss of 60p in every Â£1.A recent survey by the Local Government Information Unit (LGIU) suggested 95% of local authorities planned to increase council tax this financial year and two thirds have dipped into their reserves. While, on Children's Services alone, BBC figures revealed a Â£640m overspend last year. The Department for Housing, Community and Local Government says Â£90.7bn will be provided to councils over the next two years, on top of giving them the power to earn extra through retaining an increased share of business rates.  But Labour say budgets are ""stretched to breaking point,"" with urgent sustainable funding immediately needed or councils will collapse.So which councils are under the most strain? The council made national headlines after it issued a rare Section 114 notice - its second in a year - which effectively bans all new spending. It was part of an effort to save Â£60-70m during this financial year. With services set to be stripped back to the bare minimum, there is concern among campaigners that vital facilities will face the axe. But council leader Matthew Golby says nobody will be put in danger.  Councillors have since voted to abolish the council entirely, replacing the county and seven district councils with two new unitary authorities from 2020 as it tries to get a grip on its financial future. After todayâs vote, Northamptonshire will become the first council to be scrapped because of Tory austerity and mismanagement... https://t.co/atMoZBBsmqEnd of Twitter post  by @GwynneMPOn Monday evening, the council announced Â£13m worth of extra cuts and the loss of up to 130 jobs as it seeks to tackle an Â£11.4m overspend that came predominately in children's services.The 70 savings proposals, due to be voted on next week, include a reduced road gritting service, suspension of a town centre and hospital park and ride and a reduction in youth services. The council leader says Somerset is at the ""very sharp end"" of continued austerity. East Sussex has the one of the oldest populations in the UK, meaning social care pressures in the region are particularly acute.With demand increasing, in July the council announced a ""core offer"" to residents to meet its legal duties after a report forecast further required savings of up to Â£46m by 2021/22.Short of specifics, the contents of this offer are due to be published soon.Second council cuts services to 'minimum'The council spent nearly Â£177m of its reserves to balance its budget in the last two years which ""masked the council's true position"", according to a July report by independent auditors.Though the council is not in immediate danger it may miss its savings target of over Â£100m by 2021/22. It too, like many other councils, has been over reliant on reserves in recent years. As a result the council's financial position is ""at a tipping point"", according to its auditors. The report predicts ""difficult decisions ahead"" for the council as it endeavours to save Â£135m by 2022. A quarterly analysis revealed this council is set for a Â£8.6m overspend in 2018/19 - Â£5m of it on children's services. This comes on top of a Â£5.2m overspend the year before, meaning more changes to frontline services in the coming months. A true-blue Conservative heartland and the local council of key cabinet ministers, Surrey has repeatedly used one-off measures over recent years to balance the budget - something its latest accounts warn is ""not repeatable"". It threatened to hold a referendum on raising council tax by 15% such were its budgetary pressures, only to row back at the last moment.   As a pre-emptive measure to avoid running into reserves, unitary authority Torbay has introduced a spending moratorium, effectively outlawing non-urgent purchases - a measure that could mean the cancellation of next year's Torbay Air Show. The council's chief executive Steve Parrock says they have not run out of money or reserves but are facing increased demand combined with Government funding cuts. Leader Louise Goldsmith says the council faces going the way of Northamptonshire if it doesn't balance its budget next year.  To achieve this, one of the measures the council is considering is to cut its Â£6m housing support budget. This has led to criticism from charities and local MPs, who say rough sleepers will be pushed onto the streets.  Council says ""dire"" state of local government funding is forcing them to take tough choices. Central Government tells us it's still committed to ending rough sleeping by 2027 and it's spending more money to do so.End of Twitter post  by @BenRTWeiszThe 2019/20 budget is the ""most challenging the council has ever faced"" as it seeks to address a projected deficit of nearly Â£6m - an increase from the Â£1.4m shortfall previously predicted. Savings have yet to be identified but chiefs are blaming factors outside the council's control including nine successive years of austerity, inflation and increasing social care pressures. Over a two to three-year period up to 890 council jobs could be lost as the council considers a revamp to increase digital investment and make use of new technology such as drones. The proposal could save up to Â£58m over five years without cutting key services.  While the council is under no immediate threat, the proposed measures represent a drastic attempt to save money without slashing frontline services. The council insists it has a good levels of reserves and no cashflow problems - and it is not in the same position as Northamptonshire County Council and others cutting key services.A new draft funding settlement for 2019/20 is due to be published in the autumn and released in 2019. For some councils, extra funds cannot come too soon."
2018-09-07,Tax cut for self-employed workers scrapped,https://web.archive.org//web/20180907212446/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45439542,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA planned tax cut for 2.7m self-employed workers has been scrapped by the UK government.It was originally due to scrap Class 2 National Insurance contributions in April but the move had been delayed by a year and has now been shelved.It cited concerns that low-earning self-employed people would pay more to access the state pension, and it would make the tax system more complex.Labour's John McDonnell called it a ""betrayal of the self-employed"".The government was originally due to scrap Class 2 NI contributions, paid by self-employed people with profits of Â£6,205 or more a year, in April 2018 but last year announced it was delaying that for a year.But it announced on Thursday that they would not now be abolished in this Parliament.The move was set to save millions of workers about Â£150 a year. But there had been concerns that the move would hit more than 300,000 self-employed people earning less than Â£6,000 a year who were paying the Class 2 NICs voluntarily, in order to access the state pension. They would have faced being moved to Class 3 contributions, raising weekly payments from Â£2.95 to Â£14.65.In a written statement, Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick said the change had been intended to simplify the tax system for the self-employed but it had ""become clear"" that a ""significant number"" of self-employed people with the lowest profits would have ended up paying more.""Having listened to those likely to be affected by this change, we have concluded that it would not be right to proceed during this Parliament, given the negative impacts it could have on some of the lowest earning in our society,"" it said. Trying to address the concerns would have meant ""greater complexity to the tax system, undermining the original objective of the policy"".He added: ""The government remains committed to simplifying the tax system for the self-employed and will keep this issue under review in the context of the wider tax system and the sustainability of the public finances.""But shadow chancellor Mr McDonnell said: ""This is yet another betrayal of the self-employed. These people are the engine of the economy and have been let down again, while giant corporations have seen their tax bills slashed."" The Federation of Small Businesses said it would hit more than three million people and would ""net the Treasury more than Â£350m annually in the three years to 2021"".FSB Chairman Mike Cherry said the Treasury ""should have worked harder"" to find ways to protect low-earners.""The self-employed community has been let down today, missing out on a promise to reduce their tax burden. ""This raises serious questions once again about the government's commitment to supporting the self-employed. ""He added: ""Class 2 NICs is a regressive levy that indiscriminately hits sole traders and makes life even tougher for those who are hard-up."""
2018-09-07,Ofsted cuts 'leave parents guessing',https://web.archive.org//web/20180907212446/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-45433653,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowParents in England are not getting the assurance they need about the quality of education their children are receiving, a committee of MPs warns.It is unacceptable that so many schools - previously rated outstanding by education watchdog Ofsted - are exempt from being reinspected, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says.PAC says cuts to Ofsted's budget mean families cannot make informed choices.Ofsted says it is confident inspections offer parents the assurance they need.Ofsted's chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said it was maintaining ""excellent levels of assurance"" despite its budget being more than halved. ""One might think that a parliamentary committee that was responsible for public money would be pleased that we had put so much effort into staying within our means. It would certainly be the first to roast us if we didn't,"" she said. The PAC report highlights a number of concerns, saying:The committee acknowledges funding issues. ""We recognise that Ofsted's budget has been cut significantly in recent years, and the amount it spent on inspecting the schools sector fell by 52% in real terms between 1999-2000 and 2017-18. ""However, this has led Ofsted and the Department for Education to focus narrowly on the cost of inspection, rather the value of getting independent assurance about schools' effectiveness.""The report also criticises the watchdog for incorrectly stating in its annual report for 2016-17 that it had met the statutory target for reinspecting schools every five years, when it had actually failed to do this for 43 schools. Under legislation, schools that Ofsted has previously rated as outstanding are exempt from routine reinspections - unless the watchdog identifies a particular risk. As at August 2017, 1,620 schools had not been inspected for six years or more, including 296 schools that had not been inspected for 10 years or more. The PAC report says: ""As a result, some pupils go through the whole of primary and/or secondary school without any independent assessment of their school's effectiveness.""Earlier this year, the National Audit Office warned that Ofsted's ""effectiveness has reduced"" as a result of the decision by the Department for Education and the watchdog to end routine inspections for these schools.Meg Hillier, the committee's chairwoman, said: ""Cuts to Ofsted's budget have undermined families' ability to make informed decisions about schools.""If the level of inspection continues to be eroded there is a risk that Ofsted will come to be perceived by parents, Parliament and taxpayers as not relevant or worse, simply a fig leaf for government failures on school standards. ""Should this happen, its credibility will evaporate.""Ofsted's chief inspector Ms Spielman, said: ""As with all of the public sector, we have had to do more with less. ""However, I remain confident that our inspections provide parents, schools and the government with the assurance they need about school standards and that we do so in a way that compares very favourably in terms of quality and value for money with school inspection regimes internationally,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""However, we have reached the limit in terms of being able to provide that level of assurance within our current funding envelope. ""That is why, with our ongoing framework review, we are looking at how to ensure that schools and parents get everything they need from our reports, and why many of the committee's recommendations are already long in train."" Ms Spielman added that she would continue to speak out on issues in the sector, such as the dangers of illegal unregistered schools, the risks of radicalisation, the narrowing of the curriculum and the importance of early literacy."
2018-09-07,World leaders back UK Novichok allegations,https://web.archive.org//web/20180907212446/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45439388,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed with the UK's assessment that Russia's government ""almost certainly"" approved the Salisbury poisoning.They have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme.At a UN Security Council meeting to discuss the attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". The head of GCHQ has said the UK's allies would ""reject the Kremlin's brazen determination to undermine the international rules-based order"".In a speech in Washington, Jeremy Fleming said: ""The threat from Russia is real. It's active.""He added: ""And it will be countered by a strong international partnership of allies. Able to deploy the full range of tools from across our national security apparatus.""Mr Fleming said the intelligence community had supported police in a ""painstaking"" and ""highly complex"" investigation into what happened after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury on 4 March.The UK named two men, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, believed to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, as the main suspects. The Kremlin called these accusations ""unacceptable"". A statement from Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel, Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau said: ""We, the leaders of France, Germany, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, reiterate our outrage at the use of a chemical nerve agent, known as Novichok, in Salisbury on March 4.""The leaders welcomed progress in the investigation, but urged those with more information to go to UK authorities. ""We have full confidence in the British assessment that the two suspects were officers from the Russian military intelligence service, also known as the GRU,"" the statement added. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries in response to the 4 March attack, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"".The leaders said the link to the Russian service - revealed on Wednesday - would strengthen their intention to work together against foreign spy networks, the use of chemical weapons, and to ""defend ourselves from all forms of malign state activity directed against us and our societies"".The UN Security Council, of which Russia is a permanent member, alongside China and UK allies the US and France, met in New York to discuss the latest progress in the investigation. Addressing the council, Britain's ambassador to the UN Karen Pierce, said the nerve agent attack was a ""direct challenge"" to the ""rules-based international system that has kept all of us safe since 1945"".In a lengthy rebuttal, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"".But Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and UK citizens. ""We have lost all hope in finding the truth,"" he said, adding that the latest developments were ""invented out of thin air"".He highlighted a number of so-called ""inconsistencies"", which he said were ""off the charts"", in the UK's evidence.Theresa May told the Commons on Wednesday that the two suspects had entered the UK on Russian passports.She told MPs the poisoning was ""not a rogue operation"" and was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state. Prosecutors in the UK believe there is sufficient evidence to charge the pair with offences including conspiracy to murder; attempted murder and the use and possession of Novichok contrary to the Chemical Weapons Act.Russia does not extradite its nationals, but a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained in case the men travel to the EU.Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned with Novichok on 4 March. Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident in Salisbury.  Police have also linked the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in nearby Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess and harmed her friend Charlie Rowley."

What is going on?In a Rotherhithe theatre hall that looks like the perfect setting for Shakespeare, Labour members gather to discuss plans to make it easier for local parties to remove their MPs. It's a meeting that's part of a ""democracy roadshow"" organised by the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting MP Chris Williamson. But talk of this tour being about plots to oust disloyal MPs is much ado about nothing, according to the Derby North MP. ""It's not a hatefest, it's a lovefest,"" Chris Williamson tells the 60 or so people who've come to hear him. Mr Williamson has been holding meetings like this one across the country all summer while the debate in Labour around the selection rules for Westminster MPs has been gaining traction.Thirteen Labour Party branches are now trying to get the issue of how MPs are selected on to the agenda at the Labour conference in Liverpool later this month.Some are calling for Labour MPs to be subject to mandatory open contests. The Jeremy Corbyn-supporting group Momentum also changed its official position earlier this week in favour of an open selection process. In the theatre hall at Rotherhithe's Sands Films Studio, almost every hand goes up when Mr Williamson asks people who support mandatory re-selection for MPs to raise their hands for a selfie. But then this is an audience made up of left-wingers - some Labour, some not - who have travelled here on a weekday evening to listen to him speak about the subject, so he's probably preaching to the converted.Among them is Pascale Mitchell, a former Liberal Democrat who joined Labour in 2013. She helped to organise the event, and invited me along to watch. She says trying to change the rules on selection isn't about getting rid of MPs who do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn. ""It means that the MPs will actually work to be more useful for the local people and the communities, because they're under a bit more scrutiny. ""I don't think it's a mechanism to get rid of MPs, I think it's a mechanism to make MPs better.""Her local Labour MP disagrees. Neil Coyle was elected in Bermondsey and Old Southwark in 2015 -pushing out Lib Dem Simon Hughes, who had held the seat for 32 years. Mr Coyle meets me in a neighbourhood in Bermondsey where knife crime claimed the life of a young man this summer. He says what voters here ""want to see is a Labour party focused on the struggle they face, on getting crime addressed"".""This is something the government's getting away with and that's something people should hear more from the Labour Party on,"" he says. ""Instead, we're spending hour after hour, day after day, week after week on internal issues that are irrelevant - by and large - not just to the majority of Labour members, but to the vast majority of voters.""Mr Coyle has been a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party. He believes that is why his constituency is one of the stops on Chris Williamson's tour - which he says is all about targeting MPs who aren't cheerleaders for the Labour leader.""This is only coming from those who think that they need more Corbyn clones in Parliament to do better,"" says Mr Coyle. ""Actually I disagree. If this system had been in place in the past who knows, Blair and New Labour could have used it to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn as an MP. ""It's a very dangerous precedent to suggest that any leader should be able to dictate who their MPs are.""The MP said there was ""already a process, the trigger ballot system, which is where members' branches and affiliates can trigger an open selection instead of the automatic retention of their sitting MP"".Under current Labour rules, sitting MPs who wish to stand for re-election are subject to a so-called ""trigger ballot"" process. If more than half of the branches and affiliates in the local constituency vote ""yes"" the MP is reselected. If they vote ""no"", then the process is put to an open selection in which other candidates can stand against the sitting MP.Chairing this democracy roadshow meeting in south London is Councillor Jack Buck. He joined Labour in 2014, is a member of Momentum and was elected to Southwark Council at the local elections in May this year.He tells me the current system is not fit for purpose.""I think that the selection procedures at the moment create quite a negative atmosphere.  ""The way in which the trigger ballot system works within the party that's been introduced creates this kind of environment of hostility, whereby anybody who wants to see thriving democratic process in the party has to vote against somebody instead of for something.""I think what Labour party members want is politicians of all stripes putting positive visions forward that they can really get behind and create an atmosphere that's policy-driven.""Policy is another key issue on the agenda at this meeting.Chris Bright, who's a member of Camberwell and Peckham CLP and the Southwark Momentum group, re-joined Labour in 2015 on the day Jeremy Corbyn became its leader, after having left the party in the 1980s.He tells me Labour needs to change to meet the needs of the more than half a million-strong membership who want more of a say in its policy direction.  ""Members generally feel that they don't have enough input into policy-making. ""We've got a much bigger membership now than in the past and those people want to get engaged in decisions about the direction of the party, national policy, local policy and we feel that the Labour party should be responsive to that and give ordinary members more of an input.""Labour's Democracy Review has been looking at how the grassroots could have a greater say in party matters, and was discussed by the party's ruling body - the National Executive Committee - this week. But de-selection hasn't been included in the review. Speaking to me in Rotherhithe, Chris Williamson said that was why local Labour branches across the country are making their own submissions to get the subject on the agenda at conference.""The mandatory re-selection is not actually part of the terms of reference of the democracy review.""There are a few motions that have been forwarded by constituency parties. ""The one that I'm backing and I hope that will get support is the one that's been put forward by Labour International, which is calling for open selections so that sitting MPs are subject to an endorsement process between three years and four years into their term of office.""If the motion does make it onto the conference agenda in Liverpool and enough Labour members vote for it, it could end up becoming party policy."

The government's proposed pilot scheme would allow the recruitment of up to 2,500 workers on six-month visas between the spring of 2019 and December 2020. The National Farmers Union (NFU) said the government's announcement was a ""major victory"" after two years of evidence that ""a shortage of workers has been hampering food production"". But British Summer Fruits - the industry body representing companies that supply fresh berries in UK supermarkets - says it's not enough. According to British Summer Fruits, farms are already reporting staff shortages of between 10% and 20%.The NFU estimates that 60,000 seasonal workers are employed in UK horticulture every year. If that's right, then 10% to 20% would imply a range of between 6,000 and 12,000 workers per year, although other estimates believe the figure is higher. What is clear is that the overwhelming majority of those workers had - in previous years - come from Central and Eastern Europe.  The NFU says roughly 67% have come from Romania and Bulgaria, 23% from eight other Central and Eastern European countries in the EU, and just 1% from the UK itself. Fewer seasonal workers have been coming to the UK from Central and Eastern Europe since the Brexit referendum, partly because of the decline in the value of the pound, which makes the amount paid to EU workers worth less when they return home and convert it into euros.It is also partly because other EU countries such as Germany are making greater efforts to attract seasonal workers. There is also the argument - which is more difficult to quantify - that EU workers feel less welcome than they did before. Whatever the precise reasons, the vast majority of fruit growers are worried that shortages of seasonal workers are going to get worse. There has already been an impact.In 2017, the NFU says, wages increased by an average of 9% compared with 2016. But the shortages were still there and there was no sign of more local workers signing up for the work. There has been plenty of anecdotal information about fruit left rotting in the fields - but it's hard to get any overall figures for the amount of fruit that may have been left on the plants across the UK.There are some clues out there, though.Angus Growers - based in Arbroath on the east coast of Scotland - says it was unable to pick 83.5 tonnes of soft fruit with an estimated value of Â£416,000 last year, because of a shortage of labour. Overall, it says, the total shortage of work days (the number of people multiplied by the number of days work missed) was 7,944. British Summer Fruits estimates that Angus Growers represents about 10% of the UK berry production.It is only one example but other companies tell similar stories. And the concern is that future growth in the sector is under threat. The government's proposed pilot scheme represents ""a 4% increase in a shrinking workforce"", says Nick Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits. ""The UK berry industry grows by at least 8% per annum and this [the government's plan] will not sustain a standstill, let alone growth."" Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs suggest those fears have not yet been realised. They say there was production of Â£541m of soft fruit in 2017, up from Â£495m in 2016. In the same period, orchard fruit rose from Â£205m to Â£224m.But labour shortages are certainly beginning to bite. The last time the UK had a seasonal agricultural worker scheme in 2013, 21,250 workers were allowed into the UK from Bulgaria and Romania before they gained full EU rights to freedom of movement.And many people in the industry believe similar numbers will be needed in the future. The government has suggested that it is willing to listen. ""We will review the pilot's results,"" said the Environment Secretary Michael Gove, ""as we look at how best to support the longer-term needs of industry outside the EU.""What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-09-07,The Brexiteers' alternative?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180907212446/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45423791,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAs Westminster is settling down to the next phase of its collective mild nervous breakdown, the pushback to Brexiteers' criticism of Theresa May's Chequers plan is that the naysayers don't have their own. It's not that far off from saying 'come and have a go if you think you're hard enough'!Or, in more polite terms, the kind that your parents might have advised, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. Those in government are deeply frustrated that they get knocked about by criticism from Brexiteers (and not just Boris Johnson, honest) who are right now engaged in an overt plan to kill off the prime minister's plan, based on months of work,  but are yet to front up with their own proposal. In the coming days, the Brexiteers, organised behind the scenes by that powerful grouping, the ERG, which regular readers here will be very familiar with, have a plan to counter that accusation.I hear from Sunday onwards we should expect several days of carefully planned announcements, almost like a government grid perhaps, where the Brexiteers, with their eyes ruthlessly on their short term prize of ""chucking Chequers"", will lay out an alternative. A roll out of written papers will begin over the weekend, with a big event expected in Westminster on Monday which, if it comes off, would just by chance coincide with Boris Johnson's next newspaper column. Plans, which are in this very febrile environment subject to a whole lot of change, are right now for a push on Sunday to make the argument for a free trade agreement, rather than Chequers.On Monday, we should see an explanation of the Brexiteers' vision for money and migration, and then on Wednesday for solutions to be presented for the crucial Northern Irish border question and other issues like agriculture and fishing. The idea is not, sources say crucially, to put pressure directly on Theresa May to trigger some kind of putsch. But don't be in any doubt, it is a carefully worked-through plan designed to present alternatives to what the government has put on the table, calculated to force the prime minister to ditch the policy. Of course, by publishing their own plans, the Brexiteers' will submit themselves to the same kind of scrutiny that the government itself has. It is one thing, they are well aware, to be merely critics, quite another to commit to alternatives that it's likely Number 10 will waste little time in tearing down. The emerging consensus among Brexiteers seems to be that it is better to present an alternative that will be open to criticism, than face the charge of having no worked out ideas of their own. The idea, when ministers say to MPs 'well it's Chequers or nothing', is their solution can fill in that blank. And to try, notably, to make Theresa May perform a huge U-turn before the Tory conference and admit, whether privately, tacitly, or publicly, that the July settlement simply can't stand.Those involved in designing the ""chuck Chequers"" plan are careful to point out that they would absolutely support the prime minister in shifting position. The condition being, if she does their bidding, they won't seek to damage her further. The political truth is too that while many Brexiteers would be ruthless in trying to achieve their political goal, their aim right now, and this goes for Boris Johnson too, is that the target is changing the policy, not changing the Tory party's leader. Yet for those in government right now, there is no question whatsoever of ditching the Chequers deal. Remember it's only the basis for a negotiation, and it took the government two years (yes two years) to come to that position. And insiders say for all the claims of Chequers being dead, in fact it will to a large extent be part of the eventual deal. In other words, remember, remember, remember Chequers was always a document from which a negotiation would finally start, and inside government there is still a strong belief that elements of it will survive. There's an acknowledgement inside government too that the next few weeks will be extremely testing. But right now, there is not even a sniff that they would be able, even if willing, to give one inch to the Brexiteers. But they are organised, determined and willing to try to force her to move, and might have more in their armoury if the prime minister sticks to her ground.  "
2018-09-07,All-female government,https://web.archive.org//web/20180907212446/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45117794,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMen have been cleared out of government and the women are in charge. That's the premise of a play, opening on Thursday, which has been collectively written by a group of leading female figures. The Assemblywomen by the Greek playwright Aristophanes was first written in 391 BC.Back then, a play about the women of Athens dressed as men (complete with fake beards) storming the Assembly and taking charge was seen as a totally unrealistic premise.Indeed, that was one of the reasons it worked as a comedy - and made for the perfect vehicle for the playwright to criticise the Athenian government at the time. Now, a group of leading female figures - among them poets, writers, comedians, broadcasters and politicians - have given the show a makeover, and the newly-titled Women in Power opens this week.Director Sam Hodges says the current political and social turmoil was the catalyst for bringing back a play which he describes as ""deeply resonant"" today.But things have, of course, changed dramatically since it was first written. Many leading female figures now spring to mind in the world of politics and public service.There's Prime Minister Theresa May. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The Commissioner of the Met Police, Cressida Dick. German Chancellor Angela Merkel.But the fact that a select few names always spring to mind is precisely why more progress needs to be made, argues Labour MP Jess Phillips, who's written Women in Power's opening scene.""You couldn't name all the men who are in power in the world right now could you?"" she asks BBC News.The backbencher adds the number of women in power will only be noteworthy when ""we can no longer list them because it's just the norm and there are so many"".""We're noticing it because it's a good thing, but the FTSE 100 companies, there's like 10 women out of 100, so we're still a very long way off.""(It's actually even fewer than that, seven out of 100 of the CEOs are women - there are more men called David or Steven in the top 100 then there are women.)But in the media and entertainment landscape, women are starting to have much more visibility.All female line-ups are very much in fashion, whether it's on panel shows or in Hollywood films like Ocean's 8 and Ghostbusters.Not everyone is happy about such things of course - the Ghostbusters trailer became the most disliked in YouTube history, while some critics said Ocean's 8 wouldn't have been as successful if it hadn't piggy-backed on a male franchise.On Monday, the BBC's new political show Politics Live took some viewers by surprise with its all-female line-up.Presenter Jo Coburn presided over a panel which included former home secretary Amber Rudd and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, alongside the corporation's political editor Laura Kuenssberg.While something unimaginable in Aristophanes's day may well now be seen as progressive - not all viewers were happy.The Daily Mail, The Guardian and The Daily Express picked up on the backlash to the all-female panel, with many on social media criticising ""woke producers"" for putting political correctness and virtue signalling ahead of editorial values. Editor Rob Burley  defended the show on Twitter, writing that he had ""literally zero shame"" about having an all-female panel.Similarly, Women in Power is a play which will likely have some people rolling their eyes at what could be perceived as yet another example of men being actively removed or excluded from a project.Comedian Shappi Khorsandi, who has also written a scene for the show, has some sympathy for the position many modern men find themselves in, adding that they shouldn't feel threatened by pro-women projects such as this.""It will be a real shame if [men feeling attacked] put them off coming, because in a play, things are longer, more nuanced, more humorous, and with actors, you can see the whites of their eyes, you have a connection,"" she says.""Men are in a difficult position in some ways. On the one hand, we're all up in arms about mental health - the fact that the biggest killer of men under 50 is suicide. And yet, on the other, we're peddling this narrative of white middle class men having no right to an input.""So on the one hand we're like, we've got to listen to them all, on another we're telling them to shut up.""Phillips adds: ""It's not intended to attack men. I don't hate men, I've got two sons for god's sake. I love men.""But the fact of the matter is there's still a massive equality imbalance. And if men feel under attack, all that is is a bit of their privilege being chipped away. ""And that's okay, they should want to share it. They should want what they have, whether it's economic stability or personal safety, to be shared. It's not an attack, it's an equalisation.""Writer Wendy Cope, comedian Jenny Eclair and broadcaster Natalie Haynes are among the other names to have contributed scenes to Women in Power.The play, though humorous, explores some quite serious and nuanced themes about the differences between the ways men and women operate, and the merits of each.""The big difference with men and women is that women form alliances,"" says Khorsandi.""They form unbreakable bonds and pacts with one another, and they get into gangs and cliques. And the pressure with women is to be a friend or a foe. ""Whereas men disagree, they argue, they fall out, they have philosophical differences, but they put them down and have a beer together afterwards. They separate emotional attachment from debate.""Phillips adds: ""If women were to be completely in power for even just a month in the UK, there would be a huge change in the decisions that get made.""""I think women are better at taking risks in lots of places. I think women are much more likely to work with each other to try and find a way through. ""In my experience, women work across barriers and assess humanity in a different way in politics... they would be able to progress things quicker because we're much more likely to work together to get a common goal. ""So yeah I think it would potentially be more efficient. It would also potentially just be pleasant. It would stop being about who's the best and start being much more about the country.""So, is Phillips' reason for getting involved in writing the play an attempt to further boost her profile, perhaps a result of leadership ambitions herself?""Oh god no, I'm just useless at saying no to things,"" she laughs, ""which is a very female trait!""Women in Power opens on Thursday at the NST City (at the Nuffield Southampton Theatres), and moves to the Oxford Playhouse in October."

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to Â£40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-07,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180907212446/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task.

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign.

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

It follows claims by Labour MP Chuka Umunna that centre-left MPs are being run out the party, as he urged Mr Corbyn to ""call off the dogs"". Mr McDonnell branded the comments ""grossly offensive"", saying ""our party members are not dogs"". Some Labour MPs lost no-confidence votes by local party members this week. But the shadow chancellor told the BBC: ""There is no campaign directed by the leadership, or anybody as far as I can see, to drive MPs out.""Responding to Mr Umunna's comments he said it was ""unacceptable"" to refer to party members as ""dogs"".""They are the people who go out and deliver the leaflets, who canvas, who get Labour MPs elected and who secure a Labour government that will transform the lives of our country,"" he said.He told Mr Umunna: ""Stop throwing yourself in front of TV cameras, inventing stories and get out there and start campaigning for a Labour government. ""In a speech on Saturday Mr Umunna - a leading member of the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a second referendum - warned so-called moderates were being ""targeted systematically"" and faced a ""clear and present danger"" of being run out of the party by hardline factions. Some critics of Mr Corbyn have faced battles with their local parties. This week Chris Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, lost a no-confidence vote from one branch of the local party  while Enfield North's Joan Ryan and Luton South's Gavin Shuker also lost no confidence votes.Mr Leslie accused the party leadership machine of orchestrating the move.But Mr McDonnell insisted there was ""no co-ordinated campaign"" and it was ""democratic"" for members to express dissatisfaction with their local MP in this way. The votes carry no official force in the party. It comes as Mr McDonnell begins a speaking tour of the UK to highlight Conservative spending cuts.He launched the ""road to rebuilding the economy tour"" in Broxtowe, the Nottinghamshire constituency of Conservative MP Anna Soubry, on Saturday.Earlier this week, former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was ""not sure it is possible"" for Labour ""moderates"" to take the party back from Mr Corbyn and the left - and hinted at the creation of a new ""centre ground"" party.Other Labour MPs who have lost local confidence votes include Frank Field, who quit the parliamentary party last week - citing the handling of the anti-Semitism row and bullying in local constituency parties - and Kate Hoey. Graham Stringer won a confidence vote in his constituency.These ballots were organised by activists angry at Mr Field, Ms Hoey and Mr Stringer's decision to back the government in Brexit votes, which they say robbed Labour of the chance of forcing a general election it could have won."
2018-09-08,Ministers plan divorce law overhaul,https://web.archive.org//web/20180908232118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45452146,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDivorce laws in England and Wales are set to be overhauled under government plans seeking to allow couples to split up more quickly and with less acrimony.Justice Secretary David Gauke, who has said the system creates ""unnecessary antagonism"", is to begin a consultation on introducing ""no-fault"" divorces.Campaigners said it could be a ""landmark moment"" for divorce law.In July, a woman's appeal for divorce was rejected by the Supreme Court due to her husband's refusal to split.Tini Owens, 68, from Worcestershire, wanted to divorce her husband of 40 years on the grounds she is unhappy. Her husband Hugh has refused the split and the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the appeal, meaning she must remain married until 2020.Under the current law in England and Wales, unless people can prove their marriage has broken down due to adultery, unreasonable behaviour or desertion, the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's consent is to live apart for five years.The government's proposals - first reported by Buzzfeed - could see the concept of fault, or blame, removed from the process. Spouses could lose the right to contest a divorce, as part of the reform.By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondentPressure has been building for decades for a system of no-fault divorce. The Law Commission recommended it in 1990 and many senior judges favour it.  The reason? Many believe that when divorcing couples are being torn apart emotionally and financially, and trying to make living arrangements for their children, assigning blame to one party can only exacerbate an already stressful process.  No-fault divorce would have been introduced in a 1996 Act of Parliament requiring spouses to attend ""information meetings"" to encourage reconciliation, but following pilot schemes, the government decided it was unworkable. The Ministry of Justice will seek to end the right of spouses to contest a divorce, and also consult on how long the parties need to wait before becoming entitled to one, suggesting a minimum of six months.  Essentially, the government is proposing a notification system where, after a defined period, if one spouse still maintains the marriage has broken down irretrievably, they become entitled to a divorce.  There will be some who fear such a system will undermine marriage, but many believe it could remove a layer of stress and anxiety from one of life's most traumatic experiences.Speaking in the House of Lords, Baroness Vere of Norbiton said the call for reform after recent judgements had been noted and the lord chancellor was ""sympathetic"" to the argument for reform.""We are looking at ways to reduce conflict in a divorce, whether that can be no-fault, whether that can be under financial provisions, whether that can be for enforceable nuptial agreements,"" she added. Nigel Shepherd, chairman of the national family lawyer's organisation Resolution, said that couples had been forced ""into needless acrimony and conflict"" under the current system, ""to satisfy an outdated legal requirement"".""Today's news has the potential to be a landmark moment for divorce law in England and Wales,"" he said.""The government appears to have heeded our calls to make our divorce system fit for the modern age, and we will continue to push for this much-needed, overdue reform to be implemented as soon as possible.""However, shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said: ""Instead of yet another consultation, the Conservatives should get on with changing our divorce laws so that they are fit for the 21st century.""Labour was ""fully committed"" to introducing no-fault divorce proceedings, he added.Jenny from Kent got divorced five years ago. Her husband divorced her on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour because it was quicker than waiting for a no-fault divorce.""I would have been quite happy to wait for the two years so that we could have had a no-fault divorce,"" she told Radio 5 live. ""The people that got caught in the middle of this were my two children because they went from seeing their parents talking and being quite amenable to each other to having real arguments and being quite nasty to each other - purely because of the process.""Law Society president Christina Blacklaws said it was time to bring divorce law ""into the 21st century"".In Scotland, a simplified divorce procedure is available (to couples without children of the marriage under 16) where people can prove their marriage is broken down with one year's separation - with consent of both partners - or two years separation without consent.In Northern Ireland, the grounds for divorce are the same as the current requirements for England and Wales. When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following five reasons:Source: Gov.UK"
2018-09-08,Blair doubts Labour can be 'taken back',https://web.archive.org//web/20180908232118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45438855,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTony Blair says he is ""not sure it is possible"" for Labour ""moderates"" to take the party back from the left.The former Labour leader told the BBC's Nick Robinson Labour had been through a ""profound change"" under Jeremy Corbyn. ""It is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back? I don't know,"" he said. Mr Corbyn responded: ""I think Tony should recognise that party membership is now much bigger than it has ever been.""Asked about his predecessor's comments, the Labour leader added: ""I've been in the Labour Party all my life. I am a socialist. I am determined to see a fairer and more equal society.""That's what the Labour Party exists for. We're there for human rights. We're there for social justice. We're there for the future of the people of this country.""It's not personal, it's about us as a movement. That's why we were founded. That's why the party is so big. And that's why I'm so confident that we are continually challenging this government and we will win a general election.""Mr Blair's invention comes as two more Corbyn critics lost no-confidence votes by local party members in their constituencies. Joan Ryan and Gavin Shuker dismissed the votes - which carry no official force in the party - and said they would carry on as usual, with Ms Ryan blaming ""Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard-left"" for the 94-92 vote defeat.Others to have lost similar votes include Frank Field, who quit the parliamentary party last week citing the handling of the anti-Semitism row and bullying in local constituency parties and Kate Hoey. Graham Stringer won a confidence vote in his constituency.Chuka Umunna, a leading member of the cross-party People's Voice campaign for a second EU referendum, has written to members of his local Labour Party in Streatham, south London, to deny reports that he is involved in talks about a new party, the New Statesman reports.Speaking on Nick Robinson's Political Thinking Podcast, Mr Blair said: ""I don't think the British people will tolerate a situation where, for example, the choice at the next election is Boris Johnson versus Jeremy Corbyn.""I don't know what will happen and I don't know how it will happen. ""But I just don't believe people will find that, in the country as a whole, an acceptable choice. Something will fill that vacuum.""He said there was a large constituency of voters who backed ""socially liberal, progressive"" politics but also believed in ""a strong private enterprise sector alongside a state that is capable of helping people"".Mr Blair's name has been linked with the formation of a new ""centre ground"" party, although he has never publicly backed the idea.And the former prime minister told Nick Robinson he was not as pessimistic as some of the people around him about the chances of his wing of the party regaining control of Labour.""There [are] lots of people associated with me who feel that the Labour Party is lost, that the game's over,"" he said.""I am hoping they are not right.""But he said the anti-Semitism row that had engulfed the party was ""bad because it has been, in the end, something that I just can't imagine ever having happened in the Labour Party that I joined"".""I can't imagine that we have had three to four months debating over something where we have profoundly insulted the Jewish community in our country,"" Mr Blair said.He said the current Labour leadership came from a left-wing tradition opposed to Western foreign policy. Those belonging to that tradition had always been ""on the margins"" of the party or in a different party, such as the Communists or ""Trotskyist groups"", he added.Mr Blair is a persistent critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership and warned in 2015 the Labour Party risked ""annihilation"" if he became leader. Last year he told the BBC he accepted it was ""possible"" that Mr Corbyn could become prime minister, in the wake of the 2017 snap election in which Labour defied predictions of a heavy defeat.Under Mr Corbyn's leadership, party membership has swelled from 388,000 at the end of 2015, to a reported 540,000 as of April 2018. Under Mr Blair's leadership it reached a peak of 405,000 in 1997 before falling to 198,000 by the time he left Downing Street.Labour backbencher Chris Williamson, an ally of Mr Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't really understand what Tony is talking about, the Labour Party now has never been more united. ""We achieved nearly 13m votes in the last election and we are giving hope to millions of people who had become really cynical about politics and inspiring people in a way that I never witnessed in my 42 years as a Labour Party member. ""So I think the party is going frankly from strength to strength."" And Jon Lansman, founder of the pro-Corbyn Momentum movement, said the party would ""never"" return to Mr Blair's policies.He said on Twitter: ""Tony Blair was never in the right party and there will never be a return to his politics in UK Labour.""The National Executive Committee member said that Blair-era policies like the minimum wage and Sure Start nurseries should be credited to other leaders.""Sure Start thanks to Gordon Brown, Min Wage thanks to John Smith, the tragic lost leader we should have had as PM in 1997,"" he wrote."

They said they would carry on as usual, with Ms Ryan blaming ""Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard-left"" for the 94-92 vote defeat. It comes as Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell prepares to begin a speaking tour of the UK in a bid to draw a line under bitter infighting in the party and push the agenda onto Conservative spending cuts, the Guardian reports.He is expected to launch the ""road to rebuilding the economy tour"" later in Broxtowe, the Nottinghamshire constituency of Conservative MP Anna Soubry, the paper says.Earlier this week, former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was ""not sure it is possible"" for Labour ""moderates"" to take the party back from Mr Corbyn and the left - and hinted at the creation of a new ""centre ground"" party.Meanwhile, Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb - a former minister - has joined the calls for another referendum, saying the public should ""decide if they are happy"" with the prime minister's deal.Mr Umunna has written to members of his local Labour Party in Streatham, south London, to deny reports that he is involved in talks about a new party, the New Statesman reports.In a speech to the Blairite campaign group Progress, the former frontbencher said MPs were being targeted for standing up for zero tolerance of racism.He said: ""My message to our leadership: it is within your power to stop this, so call off the dogs and get on with what my constituency, one of the most diverse communities in the nation, demands we do - without equivocation, fight this Tory Brexit. ""That is where all our efforts should be.""Mr Umunna told the BAME Voices for Progress conference that the Brexit debate has normalised hatred and that black and minority ethnic voters have ""paid the price"".He warned the Labour leadership it would be a ""complete betrayal"" of the party's values to ""act as a bystander and wave through this disastrous Brexit"" and called for it to back a referendum on the final deal.A Labour Party source criticised Mr Umunna's speech. They told the BBC: ""This is incoherent and inaccurate, and does a disservice to his constituents who want Labour to oppose the Tories' brutal cuts to the services our communities rely on.""Other Labour MPs who have lost local confidence votes include Frank Field, who quit the parliamentary party last week - citing the handling of the anti-Semitism row and bullying in local constituency parties - and Kate Hoey.

2018-09-08,Cable to quit 'once Brexit resolved',https://web.archive.org//web/20180908232118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45438907,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSir Vince Cable will stand down as Lib Dem leader ""once Brexit is resolved or stopped""- and wants non-party members to vote for his replacement.In a speech, Sir Vince set out plans to transform the party into a ""movement for moderates"".Party sources say he wants to see this delivered while he is still leader and wants to stay in his job for crucial Brexit developments.He also wants to continue campaigning for a second EU referendum.""He has a set of objectives rather than a timeline,"" a senior Lib Dem source said. The Lib Dems have 12 MPs - down from the 57 they had in 2010. The party has struggled electorally since 2010, when it formed a coalition government with the Conservatives and remains in single figures in the opinion polls.Sir Vince has predicted a realignment of British politics, as Labour and the Conservatives split over Brexit and it is thought he wants to ensure the Lib Dems, who are campaigning for a second EU referendum, are well placed to work with any new ""centre ground"" groups.The former business secretary told an audience in Westminster: ""I think we have to recognise that despite our best efforts, the Liberal Democrats might not be the only centre force in British politics. ""I think it is the worst kept secret in Westminster that political disquiet in the two major parties, is provoking some people to consider a new party of the centre ground, or several. And I think this requires us to demand better than the usual tribalism, whether that is our own or others.""Sir Vince added: ""Liberal democracy itself is under threat notably in the USA, in eastern Europe and perhaps here. Authoritarians and extremists of both right and left are on the march."" Analysis by Chief Political Correspondent Vicki YoungSome Conservative and many more Labour MPs feel increasingly ill-at-ease with the direction their party is going in. There have been conversations over summer barbecues about creating a new party, or breaking away from the old ones but there's certainly no agreement about what happens next.             Tony Blair and Sir Vince Cable share the belief that there are millions of voters on what they call the centre ground who feel homeless. Sir Vince is offering to put a roof over their heads - but it's hard to imagine dozens of Labour MPs sidling over to the Liberal Democrats. The tribal nature of British politics is deeply ingrained.    Sir Vince's answer is to open up his party to outsiders in an attempt to attract a broader range of support and maybe a different pool of political talent. He seems to be saying to those who share his liberal values and his anti-Brexit stance, that he can supply the vehicle for their journey.But without an obvious figurehead, it's hard to see how these disparate voices can become more than a crowd of disillusioned politicians, grumbling about the status quo.     The Twickenham MP said he wanted to transform the Liberal Democrats from what he called ""an old-style political party"" into a ""movement for moderates"" and had held discussions with some unnamed Labour and Conservative MPs. He advocated a change to the party's rules, so someone who was not an MP could be leader, and ""liberal minded"" people could sign up to the Lib Dems for free and get the right to vote for the leadership.He said he did not want to follow in the footsteps of Liberal prime minister William Gladstone, who served into his 80s - or fellow octogenarian leader Robert Mugabe but added: ""Reports I have read of my imminent departure are very wide of the mark.""Now is not the time for an internal election, there is serious work for me and the party to do.""Once Brexit is resolved or stopped, that will be the time to conduct a leadership election under the new rules.""His proposed changes would have to be approved by party members and will be discussed at their conference in Brighton later this month.Sir Vince took over as leader in July 2017 without a contest following the resignation of Tim Farron.The Liberal Democrats had 99,200 members as of August 2018. The Labour Party changed its membership rules under Ed Miliband from an electoral college system in which union members, MPs and party members had one-third of the vote each to a ""one member one vote"" system, which allowed ""registered supporters"" to take part for a Â£3 fee. Labour's membership swelled in 2015 and it is thought to have had about 540,000 members as of April 2018, up from around 190,000 in 2014.But there were claims that the new rules were fuelling ""entryism"" - allowing other groups to infiltrate the party in an effort to promote their own agenda.It is thought that Sir Vince plans to rewrite the rules so that supporters need to be enrolled for 12 months before voting, to prevent infiltration by rival parties."

Mrs Bradley told House magazine, a weekly publication for the Houses of Parliament. that Northern Ireland was ""a very different world from the world I came from"" and she did not realise campaigns are generally fought within each part of the community. ""I didn't understand things like when elections are fought for example in Northern Ireland - people who are nationalists don't vote for unionist parties and vice-versa.""""So, the parties fight for election within their own community.""Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities,"" she added.Mrs Bradley was appointed in January to replace James Brokenshire.Mr Brokenshire stepped down for medical reasons.""The Northern Ireland Secretary is working incredibly hard to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland,"" a Number 10 spokeswoman said. Asked if the PM remained confident that Ms Bradley was able to do the job, the spokeswoman replied: ""Yes, she is working very closely with the parties there.""Asked how voters in Northern Ireland could have confidence in Ms Bradley, the spokeswoman replied: ""I would point to all of the work that she is doing to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland.""The South Belfast Sinn FÃ©in MLA MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir criticised Mrs Bradley: ""I knew that Karen Bradley moved particularly slowly when it came to delivering rights and justice to our community, but I didn't realise she was such a slow learner as well.""However, the East Antrim DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said Mrs Bradley's lack of knowledge was understandable.""Obviously it is going to be a steep learning curve for anyone who is coming into the Northern Ireland brief,"" he said. ""I think actually Karen Bradley was giving an honest answer about what she understood about Northern Ireland before she came in here""Labour's former Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward told the BBC that Mrs Bradley should have been better informed.He said it was a dangerous thing that Mrs Bradley went into the job ""without understanding the basics"". Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017 after a bitter row between the governing parties, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in.On Thursday Mrs Bradley announced that she intended to cut Stormont Assembly members' pay.Karen Bradley has also ruled out calling a fresh Assembly election and she is to bring forward legislation to allow civil servants to make decisions in the absence of devolution.MLA pay will fall in November from Â£49,500 to Â£35,888.In her interview with House Magazine she said: ""I had no idea how wonderful Northern Ireland was. I was slightly scared of Northern Ireland because of my impression and images from 20 years ago. That is not the place that it is today.""""I freely admit that when I started this job, I didn't understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland."""

He fronted the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum and joined Theresa May's first cabinet as foreign secretary but quit in July, shortly after his fellow cabinet Brexiteer David Davis resigned, over the prime minister's Chequers plan for the UK's future relationship with the EU.In 2016, following David Cameron's resignation, Mr Johnson dramatically ruled himself out of the race to be the next Conservative leader and prime minister, after his fellow Brexit campaigner Michael Gove's surprise announcement that he would run.But the former mayor of London and current MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip is widely thought to continue to harbour leadership ambitions.Conservative MP and digital industries minister Margot James, who has criticised the former foreign secretary in the past, said:  ""It is infuriating how Boris Johnson is continuously in the news. ""The prime minister has a really difficult job to do, with the Brexit secretary, to get the best possible deal for this country out of the EU negotiations.""I'm frankly fed up with talking about Boris Johnson"".

I am Labour through and through and I will continue to stand up and fight for Labour values.""She added that losing 92 to 94 votes was ""hardly a decisive victory"": ""It never occurred to me that Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard left would [have] confidence in me. I have none in them."" The vote was covered by Iranian station Press TV, which published video on its Twitter feed. Labour Party deputy leader Tom Watson said that made a ""farce of the proceedings and is not how the modern Labour Party should conduct its affairs"".A spokesperson for the London Labour Party said: ""Filming of local Labour Party meetings is not permitted, and Enfield North will be reminded of this fact.""In 2012, Ofcom revoked Press TV's licence to broadcast in the UK, for breaching rules about editorial control over the channel. It said there was an impression that decisions were being controlled by the offices in Tehran, not the UK.Meanwhile Mr Shuker tweeted a message to his constituents about the vote in his constituency: ""It's not part of any formal procedure, so it changes nothing about my role as Labour MP for Luton South.""I'm really sorry a handful of people in the Labour Party want to overturn your vote of confidence in me last year. Their actions say far less about me - and you - than they do about the face of today's Labour Party.""I've not changed, but the Labour Party has."" Earlier, Labour peer Lord Blunkett said that both he and former deputy leader Lord Hattersley had complained to the party's general secretary about the activities of Corbyn ally Chris Williamson, who he said was putting some MPs under ""enormous pressure"" with threats of deselection.Mr Williamson who has been travelling around Labour constituencies with other prominent supporters of Mr Corbyn to make the case for greater democracy and accountability within the party - has rejected claims he is doing it to push for the removal of critics of the party leader.But Lord Blunkett told the BBC: ""It would be better if he would spend time in Conservative seats fighting the Tories or defending the very tiny majority he has in Derby North, rather than deselecting his colleagues,"" Lord Blunkett told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Lord Blunkett called on ""decent people in the Labour Party"" to ""stand up and take action"".Earlier, former Labour prime minister Tony Blair told the BBC it was a ""different type of Labour Party"" under Jeremy Corbyn adding: ""Can it be taken back? I don't know.""""There are lots of people associated with me who feel that the Labour Party's lost, that the game's over. I'm kind of hoping they're not right.""In response to Mr Blair's comments, a spokesman for the Labour Party said it was ""giving a voice and hope to communities that have been held back and ignored for years"".""Our policies to end austerity and bring water, energy and rail into public ownership are popular and reflect the mainstream of public opinion."""
2018-09-08,SNP MP 'will continue to appear on RT',https://web.archive.org//web/20180908232118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-45445848,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAn SNP MP has insisted he will continue to appear on the RT channel despite his party's Westminster leader describing it as a ""tool of the Russian state"".Angus MacNeil said the best way to counter propaganda was to go on and give a ""counter message"". Speaking on Radio Scotland, he added: ""Many people have issues with the BBC, but I am talking to it right now.""He did not directly answer whether he believed that Russia was responsible for the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Mr MacNeil was speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme the day after the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, told the programme it was clear Russia had been responsible for an ""act of state terrorism"" and called for tougher sanctions to be imposed. Mr Blackford also said it was ""now clear what the Russian authorities have been up to in the United Kingdom"", and urged people to ""think very carefully about being seen"" on RT.Mr MacNeil has appeared on the channel in the past, as have MPs from all of the main parties, and is an ally of former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who hosts a weekly show on RT. The Western Isles MP heavily promoted Mr Salmond's recent crowdfunding appeal, which raised Â£100,000 to pay for his legal action against the Scottish government over its handling of sexual misconduct claims that have been made against him. Mr Salmond strongly denies the allegations. When asked whether he would now stop appearing on RT, Mr MacNeil replied: ""No, I will talk to any media. Many people have issues with the BBC but I am talking to the BBC just now and I will talk to any media at all if it is there and possible.""He later added: ""I think it is above my pay grade to go around and to be able to hold inquiries into every media channel.""The UK government says there is clear evidence that two members of Russia's GRU military intelligence service were responsible for the novichok attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury on 4 March. Both recovered after spending several weeks in hospital.Det Sgt Nick Bailey also fell ill after responding to the incident, while the attack was linked to a separate novichok poisoning on 30 June which led to the death of Dawn Sturgess.Russia has described the evidence of its involvement which had been presented by the UK as ""lies"".Mr MacNeil, who is a member of Westminster's joint committee on national security strategy, said: ""Some people might have clear evidence of the work of the secret services of many countries, perhaps even the UK.""He was asked whether he believes what the UK government has been saying about Russian involvement in the Salisbury attack, He responded: ""The best way to counter anybody's propaganda is to go on and put a different message, and perhaps a difficult message for them as well, and not let them carry on with their propaganda. ""Because if we only talk to our friends all we will have is a single unitary voice ,that is very much in a very narrow segment of society, so I think we have to have broader voices.""If that is happening with Russia, get onto RT and say that is happening so that their propaganda, if that is the case, is not as easily put because you put a counter message on RT and not just the message that perhaps the Russian government will like to hear on RT.""Another of Mr MacNeil's SNP colleagues, Glasgow South MP Stewart McDonald, has faced criticism from some independence supporters on Twitter after questioning the decision by former Scottish Socialist MSP Tommy Sheridan to host a show on the Russian-owned Sputnik radio station. Mr McDonald, who is the SNP's defence spokesman, has also been highly critical of Mr Salmond's RT show, and has previously written that there was a ""prima facie case that Russia has sought to exploit Scottish independence as part of a wider push to destabilise western institutions"".He has also previously said an independent Scotland would stand up to Russia and would have backed Theresa May's stance over the Salisbury attack."
2018-09-08,Councils under financial strain,https://web.archive.org//web/20180908232118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45435368,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAway from the permutations of Brexit negotiations, ongoing leadership jostling and racism rows a less discussed debate continues a lot closer to home: the future of local government finances. As English councils strive to balance their yearly budgets, keep reserves stocked and plan future savings any service that can be cut is at risk. It has meant fewer bin collections, fewer libraries and - come the next Beast from the East - fewer roads that will be gritted. Instead, legal obligations dictate councils must fund certain aspects of adult social care and children's services - both of which are in high demand and very expensive.    Nationally, the overall financial picture is stark.The Local Government Association, the umbrella body for all councils, says by 2020 councils will have faced a reduction of core funding since 2010 of nearly Â£16bn - a loss of 60p in every Â£1.A recent survey by the Local Government Information Unit (LGIU) suggested 95% of local authorities planned to increase council tax this financial year and two thirds have dipped into their reserves. While, on Children's Services alone, BBC figures revealed a Â£640m overspend last year. The Department for Housing, Community and Local Government says Â£90.7bn will be provided to councils over the next two years, on top of giving them the power to earn extra through retaining an increased share of business rates.  But Labour say budgets are ""stretched to breaking point,"" with urgent sustainable funding immediately needed or councils will collapse.So which councils are under financial strain? The council made national headlines after it issued a rare Section 114 notice - its second in a year - which effectively bans all new spending. It was part of an effort to save Â£60-70m during this financial year. With services set to be stripped back to the bare minimum, there is concern among campaigners that vital facilities will face the axe. But council leader Matthew Golby says nobody will be put in danger.  Councillors have since voted to abolish the council entirely, replacing the county and seven district councils with two new unitary authorities from 2020 as it tries to get a grip on its financial future. After todayâs vote, Northamptonshire will become the first council to be scrapped because of Tory austerity and mismanagement... https://t.co/atMoZBBsmqEnd of Twitter post  by @GwynneMPOn Monday evening, the council announced Â£13m worth of extra cuts and the loss of up to 130 jobs as it seeks to tackle an Â£11.4m overspend that came predominately in children's services.The 70 savings proposals, due to be voted on next week, include a reduced road gritting service, suspension of a town centre and hospital park and ride and a reduction in youth services. The council leader says Somerset is at the ""very sharp end"" of continued austerity. East Sussex has the one of the oldest populations in the UK, meaning social care pressures in the region are particularly acute.With demand increasing, in July the council announced a ""core offer"" to residents to meet its legal duties after a report forecast further required savings of up to Â£46m by 2021/22.Short of specifics, the contents of this offer are due to be published soon.Second council cuts services to 'minimum'The council spent nearly Â£177m of its reserves to balance its budget in the last two years which ""masked the council's true position"", according to a July report by independent auditors.Though the council is not in immediate danger it may miss its savings target of over Â£100m by 2021/22. It too, like many other councils, has been over reliant on reserves in recent years. As a result the council's financial position is ""at a tipping point"", according to its auditors. The report predicts ""difficult decisions ahead"" for the council as it endeavours to save Â£135m by 2022. A quarterly analysis revealed this council is set for a Â£8.6m overspend in 2018/19 - Â£5m of it on children's services. This comes on top of a Â£5.2m overspend the year before, meaning more changes to frontline services in the coming months. A true-blue Conservative heartland and the local council of key cabinet ministers, Surrey has repeatedly used one-off measures over recent years to balance the budget - something its latest accounts warn is ""not repeatable"". It threatened to hold a referendum on raising council tax by 15% such were its budgetary pressures, only to row back at the last moment.   As a pre-emptive measure to avoid running into reserves, unitary authority Torbay has introduced a spending moratorium, effectively outlawing non-urgent purchases - a measure that could mean the cancellation of next year's Torbay Air Show. The council's chief executive Steve Parrock says they have not run out of money or reserves but are facing increased demand combined with Government funding cuts. Leader Louise Goldsmith says the council faces going the way of Northamptonshire if it doesn't balance its budget next year.  To achieve this, one of the measures the council is considering is to cut its Â£6m housing support budget. This has led to criticism from charities and local MPs, who say rough sleepers will be pushed onto the streets.  Council says ""dire"" state of local government funding is forcing them to take tough choices. Central Government tells us it's still committed to ending rough sleeping by 2027 and it's spending more money to do so.End of Twitter post  by @BenRTWeiszThe 2019/20 budget is the ""most challenging the council has ever faced"" as it seeks to address a projected deficit of nearly Â£6m - an increase from the Â£1.4m shortfall previously predicted. Savings have yet to be identified but chiefs are blaming factors outside the council's control including nine successive years of austerity, inflation and increasing social care pressures. Over a two to three-year period up to 890 council jobs could be lost as the council considers a revamp to increase digital investment and make use of new technology such as drones. The proposal could save up to Â£58m over five years without cutting key services.  While the council is under no immediate threat, the proposed measures represent a drastic attempt to save money without slashing frontline services. The council insists it has a good levels of reserves and no cashflow problems - and it is not in the same position as Northamptonshire County Council and others cutting key services.A new draft funding settlement for 2019/20 is due to be published in the autumn and released in 2019. For some councils, extra funds cannot come too soon.About this articleThis article was based on intelligence gained from BBC political reporters around the country - the councils we listed were the ones they identified as being under pressure in their areas."
2018-09-08,Tax cut for self-employed workers scrapped,https://web.archive.org//web/20180908232118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45439542,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA planned tax cut for 2.7m self-employed workers has been scrapped by the UK government.It was originally due to scrap Class 2 National Insurance contributions in April but the move had been delayed by a year and has now been shelved.It cited concerns that low-earning self-employed people would pay more to access the state pension, and it would make the tax system more complex.Labour's John McDonnell called it a ""betrayal of the self-employed"".The government was originally due to scrap Class 2 NI contributions, paid by self-employed people with profits of Â£6,205 or more a year, in April 2018 but last year announced it was delaying that for a year.But it announced on Thursday that they would not now be abolished in this Parliament.The move was set to save millions of workers about Â£150 a year. But there had been concerns that the move would hit more than 300,000 self-employed people earning less than Â£6,000 a year who were paying the Class 2 NICs voluntarily, in order to access the state pension. They would have faced being moved to Class 3 contributions, raising weekly payments from Â£2.95 to Â£14.65.In a written statement, Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick said the change had been intended to simplify the tax system for the self-employed but it had ""become clear"" that a ""significant number"" of self-employed people with the lowest profits would have ended up paying more.""Having listened to those likely to be affected by this change, we have concluded that it would not be right to proceed during this Parliament, given the negative impacts it could have on some of the lowest earning in our society,"" it said. Trying to address the concerns would have meant ""greater complexity to the tax system, undermining the original objective of the policy"".He added: ""The government remains committed to simplifying the tax system for the self-employed and will keep this issue under review in the context of the wider tax system and the sustainability of the public finances.""But shadow chancellor Mr McDonnell said: ""This is yet another betrayal of the self-employed. These people are the engine of the economy and have been let down again, while giant corporations have seen their tax bills slashed."" The Federation of Small Businesses said it would hit more than three million people and would ""net the Treasury more than Â£350m annually in the three years to 2021"".FSB Chairman Mike Cherry said the Treasury ""should have worked harder"" to find ways to protect low-earners.""The self-employed community has been let down today, missing out on a promise to reduce their tax burden. ""This raises serious questions once again about the government's commitment to supporting the self-employed. ""He added: ""Class 2 NICs is a regressive levy that indiscriminately hits sole traders and makes life even tougher for those who are hard-up."""
2018-09-08,Ofsted cuts 'leave parents guessing',https://web.archive.org//web/20180908232118/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-45433653,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowParents in England are not getting the assurance they need about the quality of education their children are receiving, a committee of MPs warns.It is unacceptable that so many schools - previously rated outstanding by education watchdog Ofsted - are exempt from being reinspected, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) says.PAC says cuts to Ofsted's budget mean families cannot make informed choices.Ofsted says it is confident inspections offer parents the assurance they need.Ofsted's chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, said it was maintaining ""excellent levels of assurance"" despite its budget being more than halved. ""One might think that a parliamentary committee that was responsible for public money would be pleased that we had put so much effort into staying within our means. It would certainly be the first to roast us if we didn't,"" she said. The PAC report highlights a number of concerns, saying:The committee acknowledges funding issues. ""We recognise that Ofsted's budget has been cut significantly in recent years, and the amount it spent on inspecting the schools sector fell by 52% in real terms between 1999-2000 and 2017-18. ""However, this has led Ofsted and the Department for Education to focus narrowly on the cost of inspection, rather the value of getting independent assurance about schools' effectiveness.""The report also criticises the watchdog for incorrectly stating in its annual report for 2016-17 that it had met the statutory target for reinspecting schools every five years, when it had actually failed to do this for 43 schools. Under legislation, schools that Ofsted has previously rated as outstanding are exempt from routine reinspections - unless the watchdog identifies a particular risk. As at August 2017, 1,620 schools had not been inspected for six years or more, including 296 schools that had not been inspected for 10 years or more. The PAC report says: ""As a result, some pupils go through the whole of primary and/or secondary school without any independent assessment of their school's effectiveness.""Earlier this year, the National Audit Office warned that Ofsted's ""effectiveness has reduced"" as a result of the decision by the Department for Education and the watchdog to end routine inspections for these schools.Meg Hillier, the committee's chairwoman, said: ""Cuts to Ofsted's budget have undermined families' ability to make informed decisions about schools.""If the level of inspection continues to be eroded there is a risk that Ofsted will come to be perceived by parents, Parliament and taxpayers as not relevant or worse, simply a fig leaf for government failures on school standards. ""Should this happen, its credibility will evaporate.""Ofsted's chief inspector Ms Spielman, said: ""As with all of the public sector, we have had to do more with less. ""However, I remain confident that our inspections provide parents, schools and the government with the assurance they need about school standards and that we do so in a way that compares very favourably in terms of quality and value for money with school inspection regimes internationally,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""However, we have reached the limit in terms of being able to provide that level of assurance within our current funding envelope. ""That is why, with our ongoing framework review, we are looking at how to ensure that schools and parents get everything they need from our reports, and why many of the committee's recommendations are already long in train."" Ms Spielman added that she would continue to speak out on issues in the sector, such as the dangers of illegal unregistered schools, the risks of radicalisation, the narrowing of the curriculum and the importance of early literacy."

What is going on?In a Rotherhithe theatre hall that looks like the perfect setting for Shakespeare, Labour members gather to discuss plans to make it easier for local parties to remove their MPs. It's a meeting that's part of a ""democracy roadshow"" organised by the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting MP Chris Williamson. But talk of this tour being about plots to oust disloyal MPs is much ado about nothing, according to the Derby North MP. ""It's not a hatefest, it's a lovefest,"" Chris Williamson tells the 60 or so people who've come to hear him. Mr Williamson has been holding meetings like this one across the country all summer while the debate in Labour around the selection rules for Westminster MPs has been gaining traction.Thirteen Labour Party branches are now trying to get the issue of how MPs are selected on to the agenda at the Labour conference in Liverpool later this month.Some are calling for Labour MPs to be subject to mandatory open contests. The Jeremy Corbyn-supporting group Momentum also changed its official position earlier this week in favour of an open selection process. In the theatre hall at Rotherhithe's Sands Films Studio, almost every hand goes up when Mr Williamson asks people who support mandatory re-selection for MPs to raise their hands for a selfie. But then this is an audience made up of left-wingers - some Labour, some not - who have travelled here on a weekday evening to listen to him speak about the subject, so he's probably preaching to the converted.Among them is Pascale Mitchell, a former Liberal Democrat who joined Labour in 2013. She helped to organise the event, and invited me along to watch. She says trying to change the rules on selection isn't about getting rid of MPs who do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn. ""It means that the MPs will actually work to be more useful for the local people and the communities, because they're under a bit more scrutiny. ""I don't think it's a mechanism to get rid of MPs, I think it's a mechanism to make MPs better.""Her local Labour MP disagrees. Neil Coyle was elected in Bermondsey and Old Southwark in 2015 -pushing out Lib Dem Simon Hughes, who had held the seat for 32 years. Mr Coyle meets me in a neighbourhood in Bermondsey where knife crime claimed the life of a young man this summer. He says what voters here ""want to see is a Labour party focused on the struggle they face, on getting crime addressed"".""This is something the government's getting away with and that's something people should hear more from the Labour Party on,"" he says. ""Instead, we're spending hour after hour, day after day, week after week on internal issues that are irrelevant - by and large - not just to the majority of Labour members, but to the vast majority of voters.""Mr Coyle has been a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party. He believes that is why his constituency is one of the stops on Chris Williamson's tour - which he says is all about targeting MPs who aren't cheerleaders for the Labour leader.""This is only coming from those who think that they need more Corbyn clones in Parliament to do better,"" says Mr Coyle. ""Actually I disagree. If this system had been in place in the past who knows, Blair and New Labour could have used it to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn as an MP. ""It's a very dangerous precedent to suggest that any leader should be able to dictate who their MPs are.""The MP said there was ""already a process, the trigger ballot system, which is where members' branches and affiliates can trigger an open selection instead of the automatic retention of their sitting MP"".Under current Labour rules, sitting MPs who wish to stand for re-election are subject to a so-called ""trigger ballot"" process. If more than half of the branches and affiliates in the local constituency vote ""yes"" the MP is reselected. If they vote ""no"", then the process is put to an open selection in which other candidates can stand against the sitting MP.Chairing this democracy roadshow meeting in south London is Councillor Jack Buck. He joined Labour in 2014, is a member of Momentum and was elected to Southwark Council at the local elections in May this year.He tells me the current system is not fit for purpose.""I think that the selection procedures at the moment create quite a negative atmosphere.  ""The way in which the trigger ballot system works within the party that's been introduced creates this kind of environment of hostility, whereby anybody who wants to see thriving democratic process in the party has to vote against somebody instead of for something.""I think what Labour party members want is politicians of all stripes putting positive visions forward that they can really get behind and create an atmosphere that's policy-driven.""Policy is another key issue on the agenda at this meeting.Chris Bright, who's a member of Camberwell and Peckham CLP and the Southwark Momentum group, re-joined Labour in 2015 on the day Jeremy Corbyn became its leader, after having left the party in the 1980s.He tells me Labour needs to change to meet the needs of the more than half a million-strong membership who want more of a say in its policy direction.  ""Members generally feel that they don't have enough input into policy-making. ""We've got a much bigger membership now than in the past and those people want to get engaged in decisions about the direction of the party, national policy, local policy and we feel that the Labour party should be responsive to that and give ordinary members more of an input.""Labour's Democracy Review has been looking at how the grassroots could have a greater say in party matters, and was discussed by the party's ruling body - the National Executive Committee - this week. But de-selection hasn't been included in the review. Speaking to me in Rotherhithe, Chris Williamson said that was why local Labour branches across the country are making their own submissions to get the subject on the agenda at conference.""The mandatory re-selection is not actually part of the terms of reference of the democracy review.""There are a few motions that have been forwarded by constituency parties. ""The one that I'm backing and I hope that will get support is the one that's been put forward by Labour International, which is calling for open selections so that sitting MPs are subject to an endorsement process between three years and four years into their term of office.""If the motion does make it onto the conference agenda in Liverpool and enough Labour members vote for it, it could end up becoming party policy."

The government's proposed pilot scheme would allow the recruitment of up to 2,500 workers on six-month visas between the spring of 2019 and December 2020. The National Farmers Union (NFU) said the government's announcement was a ""major victory"" after two years of evidence that ""a shortage of workers has been hampering food production"". But British Summer Fruits - the industry body representing companies that supply fresh berries in UK supermarkets - says it's not enough. According to British Summer Fruits, farms are already reporting staff shortages of between 10% and 20%.The NFU estimates that 60,000 seasonal workers are employed in UK horticulture every year. If that's right, then 10% to 20% would imply a range of between 6,000 and 12,000 workers per year, although other estimates believe the figure is higher. What is clear is that the overwhelming majority of those workers had - in previous years - come from Central and Eastern Europe.  The NFU says roughly 67% have come from Romania and Bulgaria, 23% from eight other Central and Eastern European countries in the EU, and just 1% from the UK itself. Fewer seasonal workers have been coming to the UK from Central and Eastern Europe since the Brexit referendum, partly because of the decline in the value of the pound, which makes the amount paid to EU workers worth less when they return home and convert it into euros.It is also partly because other EU countries such as Germany are making greater efforts to attract seasonal workers. There is also the argument - which is more difficult to quantify - that EU workers feel less welcome than they did before. Whatever the precise reasons, the vast majority of fruit growers are worried that shortages of seasonal workers are going to get worse. There has already been an impact.In 2017, the NFU says, wages increased by an average of 9% compared with 2016. But the shortages were still there and there was no sign of more local workers signing up for the work. There has been plenty of anecdotal information about fruit left rotting in the fields - but it's hard to get any overall figures for the amount of fruit that may have been left on the plants across the UK.There are some clues out there, though.Angus Growers - based in Arbroath on the east coast of Scotland - says it was unable to pick 83.5 tonnes of soft fruit with an estimated value of Â£416,000 last year, because of a shortage of labour. Overall, it says, the total shortage of work days (the number of people multiplied by the number of days work missed) was 7,944. British Summer Fruits estimates that Angus Growers represents about 10% of the UK berry production.It is only one example but other companies tell similar stories. And the concern is that future growth in the sector is under threat. The government's proposed pilot scheme represents ""a 4% increase in a shrinking workforce"", says Nick Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits. ""The UK berry industry grows by at least 8% per annum and this [the government's plan] will not sustain a standstill, let alone growth."" Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs suggest those fears have not yet been realised. They say there was production of Â£541m of soft fruit in 2017, up from Â£495m in 2016. In the same period, orchard fruit rose from Â£205m to Â£224m.But labour shortages are certainly beginning to bite. The last time the UK had a seasonal agricultural worker scheme in 2013, 21,250 workers were allowed into the UK from Bulgaria and Romania before they gained full EU rights to freedom of movement.And many people in the industry believe similar numbers will be needed in the future. The government has suggested that it is willing to listen. ""We will review the pilot's results,"" said the Environment Secretary Michael Gove, ""as we look at how best to support the longer-term needs of industry outside the EU.""What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-09-08,The Brexiteers' alternative?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180908232118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45423791,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAs Westminster is settling down to the next phase of its collective mild nervous breakdown, the pushback to Brexiteers' criticism of Theresa May's Chequers plan is that the naysayers don't have their own. It's not that far off from saying 'come and have a go if you think you're hard enough'!Or, in more polite terms, the kind that your parents might have advised, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. Those in government are deeply frustrated that they get knocked about by criticism from Brexiteers (and not just Boris Johnson, honest) who are right now engaged in an overt plan to kill off the prime minister's plan, based on months of work,  but are yet to front up with their own proposal. In the coming days, the Brexiteers, organised behind the scenes by that powerful grouping, the ERG, which regular readers here will be very familiar with, have a plan to counter that accusation.I hear from Sunday onwards we should expect several days of carefully planned announcements, almost like a government grid perhaps, where the Brexiteers, with their eyes ruthlessly on their short term prize of ""chucking Chequers"", will lay out an alternative. A roll out of written papers will begin over the weekend, with a big event expected in Westminster on Monday which, if it comes off, would just by chance coincide with Boris Johnson's next newspaper column. Plans, which are in this very febrile environment subject to a whole lot of change, are right now for a push on Sunday to make the argument for a free trade agreement, rather than Chequers.On Monday, we should see an explanation of the Brexiteers' vision for money and migration, and then on Wednesday for solutions to be presented for the crucial Northern Irish border question and other issues like agriculture and fishing. The idea is not, sources say crucially, to put pressure directly on Theresa May to trigger some kind of putsch. But don't be in any doubt, it is a carefully worked-through plan designed to present alternatives to what the government has put on the table, calculated to force the prime minister to ditch the policy. Of course, by publishing their own plans, the Brexiteers' will submit themselves to the same kind of scrutiny that the government itself has. It is one thing, they are well aware, to be merely critics, quite another to commit to alternatives that it's likely Number 10 will waste little time in tearing down. The emerging consensus among Brexiteers seems to be that it is better to present an alternative that will be open to criticism, than face the charge of having no worked out ideas of their own. The idea, when ministers say to MPs 'well it's Chequers or nothing', is their solution can fill in that blank. And to try, notably, to make Theresa May perform a huge U-turn before the Tory conference and admit, whether privately, tacitly, or publicly, that the July settlement simply can't stand.Those involved in designing the ""chuck Chequers"" plan are careful to point out that they would absolutely support the prime minister in shifting position. The condition being, if she does their bidding, they won't seek to damage her further. The political truth is too that while many Brexiteers would be ruthless in trying to achieve their political goal, their aim right now, and this goes for Boris Johnson too, is that the target is changing the policy, not changing the Tory party's leader. Yet for those in government right now, there is no question whatsoever of ditching the Chequers deal. Remember it's only the basis for a negotiation, and it took the government two years (yes two years) to come to that position. And insiders say for all the claims of Chequers being dead, in fact it will to a large extent be part of the eventual deal. In other words, remember, remember, remember Chequers was always a document from which a negotiation would finally start, and inside government there is still a strong belief that elements of it will survive. There's an acknowledgement inside government too that the next few weeks will be extremely testing. But right now, there is not even a sniff that they would be able, even if willing, to give one inch to the Brexiteers. But they are organised, determined and willing to try to force her to move, and might have more in their armoury if the prime minister sticks to her ground.  "
2018-09-08,All-female government,https://web.archive.org//web/20180908232118/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45117794,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMen have been cleared out of government and the women are in charge. That's the premise of a play, opening on Thursday, which has been collectively written by a group of leading female figures. The Assemblywomen by the Greek playwright Aristophanes was first written in 391 BC.Back then, a play about the women of Athens dressed as men (complete with fake beards) storming the Assembly and taking charge was seen as a totally unrealistic premise.Indeed, that was one of the reasons it worked as a comedy - and made for the perfect vehicle for the playwright to criticise the Athenian government at the time. Now, a group of leading female figures - among them poets, writers, comedians, broadcasters and politicians - have given the show a makeover, and the newly-titled Women in Power opens this week.Director Sam Hodges says the current political and social turmoil was the catalyst for bringing back a play which he describes as ""deeply resonant"" today.But things have, of course, changed dramatically since it was first written. Many leading female figures now spring to mind in the world of politics and public service.There's Prime Minister Theresa May. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The Commissioner of the Met Police, Cressida Dick. German Chancellor Angela Merkel.But the fact that a select few names always spring to mind is precisely why more progress needs to be made, argues Labour MP Jess Phillips, who's written Women in Power's opening scene.""You couldn't name all the men who are in power in the world right now could you?"" she asks BBC News.The backbencher adds the number of women in power will only be noteworthy when ""we can no longer list them because it's just the norm and there are so many"".""We're noticing it because it's a good thing, but the FTSE 100 companies, there's like 10 women out of 100, so we're still a very long way off.""(It's actually even fewer than that, seven out of 100 of the CEOs are women - there are more men called David or Steven in the top 100 then there are women.)But in the media and entertainment landscape, women are starting to have much more visibility.All female line-ups are very much in fashion, whether it's on panel shows or in Hollywood films like Ocean's 8 and Ghostbusters.Not everyone is happy about such things of course - the Ghostbusters trailer became the most disliked in YouTube history, while some critics said Ocean's 8 wouldn't have been as successful if it hadn't piggy-backed on a male franchise.On Monday, the BBC's new political show Politics Live took some viewers by surprise with its all-female line-up.Presenter Jo Coburn presided over a panel which included former home secretary Amber Rudd and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, alongside the corporation's political editor Laura Kuenssberg.While something unimaginable in Aristophanes's day may well now be seen as progressive - not all viewers were happy.The Daily Mail, The Guardian and The Daily Express picked up on the backlash to the all-female panel, with many on social media criticising ""woke producers"" for putting political correctness and virtue signalling ahead of editorial values. Editor Rob Burley  defended the show on Twitter, writing that he had ""literally zero shame"" about having an all-female panel.Similarly, Women in Power is a play which will likely have some people rolling their eyes at what could be perceived as yet another example of men being actively removed or excluded from a project.Comedian Shappi Khorsandi, who has also written a scene for the show, has some sympathy for the position many modern men find themselves in, adding that they shouldn't feel threatened by pro-women projects such as this.""It will be a real shame if [men feeling attacked] put them off coming, because in a play, things are longer, more nuanced, more humorous, and with actors, you can see the whites of their eyes, you have a connection,"" she says.""Men are in a difficult position in some ways. On the one hand, we're all up in arms about mental health - the fact that the biggest killer of men under 50 is suicide. And yet, on the other, we're peddling this narrative of white middle class men having no right to an input.""So on the one hand we're like, we've got to listen to them all, on another we're telling them to shut up.""Phillips adds: ""It's not intended to attack men. I don't hate men, I've got two sons for god's sake. I love men.""But the fact of the matter is there's still a massive equality imbalance. And if men feel under attack, all that is is a bit of their privilege being chipped away. ""And that's okay, they should want to share it. They should want what they have, whether it's economic stability or personal safety, to be shared. It's not an attack, it's an equalisation.""Writer Wendy Cope, comedian Jenny Eclair and broadcaster Natalie Haynes are among the other names to have contributed scenes to Women in Power.The play, though humorous, explores some quite serious and nuanced themes about the differences between the ways men and women operate, and the merits of each.""The big difference with men and women is that women form alliances,"" says Khorsandi.""They form unbreakable bonds and pacts with one another, and they get into gangs and cliques. And the pressure with women is to be a friend or a foe. ""Whereas men disagree, they argue, they fall out, they have philosophical differences, but they put them down and have a beer together afterwards. They separate emotional attachment from debate.""Phillips adds: ""If women were to be completely in power for even just a month in the UK, there would be a huge change in the decisions that get made.""""I think women are better at taking risks in lots of places. I think women are much more likely to work with each other to try and find a way through. ""In my experience, women work across barriers and assess humanity in a different way in politics... they would be able to progress things quicker because we're much more likely to work together to get a common goal. ""So yeah I think it would potentially be more efficient. It would also potentially just be pleasant. It would stop being about who's the best and start being much more about the country.""So, is Phillips' reason for getting involved in writing the play an attempt to further boost her profile, perhaps a result of leadership ambitions herself?""Oh god no, I'm just useless at saying no to things,"" she laughs, ""which is a very female trait!""Women in Power opens on Thursday at the NST City (at the Nuffield Southampton Theatres), and moves to the Oxford Playhouse in October."

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to Â£40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-08,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180908232118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

In the Mail on Sunday, the former foreign secretary said the Chequers deal was ""feeble"" and ""pathetic"".He has been strongly criticised by some Tories - one minister said it marked a ""disgusting moment"" in politics.And Home Secretary Sajid Javid called for ""measured language"" to be used.Writing in the same paper, the current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for people to rally behind Mrs May, backing her to hold the line ""in the face of intense pressure"".The UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, and the government's plan - agreed at Chequers in July - has sparked criticism from Brexiteer Tories as well as the EU.In his article, Mr Johnson accused the EU of ""bullying"" the UK - but questioned why the response had been ""so utterly feeble"". He said that rather than getting a ""generous free trade deal"", Britain is saying, ""yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir"", to Brussels. ""At every stage of the talks so far, Brussels gets what Brussels wants,"" wrote Mr Johnson. ""It is a humiliation. We look like a seven-stone weakling being comically bent out of shape by a 500lb gorilla.""He said the reason for the UK's response was the ""insanity of the so-called backstop"" - the commitment by the UK and the EU to come up with a solution to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.However, his call to scrap the proposed backstop has been heavily criticised by Sinn FÃ©in and the SDLP. Sinn Fein said Mr Johnson's comments were ""foolish and dangerous"", while the SDLP said he had ""absolutely no regard for people on this island"".The BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the ""scathing remarks"" by Mr Johnson showed his ""willingness to challenge the prime minister remains undimmed"" after recent revelations about his private life.It is Mr Johnson's second attack on the prime minister's Brexit strategy inside a week, as last Monday he said the Chequers deal ""means disaster"" for Britain - Downing Street responded to that attack by saying he had offered ""no new ideas"".While Mr Javid voiced measured criticism of Mr Johnson, other Tories reacted more angrily to his remarks.Former Army officer and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat graphically described the aftermath of a suicide bomb that had gone off near his office in Helmand province, Afghanistan.He said comparing such an attack to the PM's plans ""isn't funny"", adding: ""Some need to grow up"".A suicide bomber murdered many in the courtyard of my office in Helmand. The carnage was disgusting, limbs and flesh hanging from trees and bushes. Brave men who stopped him killing me and others died In horrific pain. Some need to grow up. Comparing the PM to that isnât funny. https://t.co/IeRWhmhgS9End of Twitter post  by @TomTugendhatForeign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan criticised his former boss, saying the article was ""one of the most disgusting moments in modern British politics.""  If this latest broadside was not the end of Mr Johnson's political career, ""I will make sure it is later"", he said.Another Foreign Office minister, Alistair Burt, tweeted: ""I'm stunned at the nature of this attack. There is no justification for such an outrageous, inappropriate and hurtful analogy.""If we don't stop this extraordinary use of language over Brexit, our country might never heal. Again, I say, enough.""But backbench Tory MP Nadine Dorries defended Mr Johnson in the face of what she was ""vitriol"", saying his critics were ""terrified of his popular appeal"".And Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said the way Mr Johnson ""says it how he sees it and speaks truth unto power"" was ""something that endears him to a huge swathe of the British public"".On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid said: ""I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences. I think it's a reminder for all of us in public policy, whichever political party we represent, to use measured language because I think that's what the public want to see.""He backed the Chequers proposals which he said represented ""the only deal that we've got on the table"".In his Mail on Sunday article, Mr Hunt said Parliament would get to debate and vote on any agreement, adding: ""Until then, we should not rush to judgement on a deal that is still under negotiation.""It is the first public comment from Mr Johnson since he and his wife, Marina Wheeler, confirmed they were getting divorced earlier this week.The announcement followed newspaper allegations the former London mayor had been having an extra-marital affair.The Sunday Times has reported that Mrs May's aides wrote a 4,000-word ""dirty dossier"" on Mr Johnson in 2016, exposing a ""catalogue of lurid allegations"" against him. The paper says it has seen the document - said to have been written during the Conservative leadership contest - but officials at Downing Street and Conservative Campaign Headquarters have denied circulating it.Elsewhere the National Police Chiefs' Council said there was no intelligence to suggest there would be an increase in crime or disorder if the UK and the EU cannot agree a deal.NPCC operations lead Chief Constable Charlie Hall was responding to a Sunday Times report of a leaked document about police contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit.According to the paper, the document warned that concerns around medical supplies could ""feed civil disorder"", and that potential goods shortages raised concerns of ""widespread protest which could then escalate into disorder"".It also warned that the ""necessity to call on military assistance is a real possibility"" in the weeks after UK's departure from the EU.Mr Javid said he did not expect a no-deal outcome, adding: ""I'm glad the police and other experts are looking into this and thinking what might happen in a no-deal scenario."""

He went on to say that the UK had ""considerable powers"" to respond to Russia.""We will bring all those powers, both overt and covert, to bear on Russia and what it represents today."""

In an interview in the Sunday Times, George Hamilton warns that the government is failing to prepare for the impact of the UK leaving the EU on the peace and security in NI. He said that he is not getting the information and clarity needed.Mr Hamilton said that some Westminster politicians view NI as ""peripheral"".""There's a feeling that as regards the Troubles and the conflict, Northern Ireland is sorted and we don't need to worry about it, when actually we're working flat out 24/7 to keep a lid on it,"" he said.Mr Hamilton issued a similar warning when he appeared before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in June.In the Sunday Times interview, he said that any physical infrastructure or border officials following the UK's withdrawal from the European Union would become targets for dissident republicans and require police protection.""The purpose for which those checking points and [Irish] border controls would be put in place would become less and less relevant because they would move away from issues of trade or movement of people to old-fashioned security on a national frontier,"" he said. ""That was done during the period of the Troubles rather unsuccessfully, and was sadly the subject of attacks and many lives lost.""Asked if the government understood Brexit's potential consequences for Northern Ireland, Mr Hamilton said: ""I'm not sure all of them do. ""I have a concern some may see issues to do with the Irish border as literally peripheral, not just geographically but in terms of impact.""The Sunday Times also reports that police chiefs elsewhere in the UK are drawing up contingency plans to deal with ""wide spread civil disorder"" at the UK's borders and ports. The newspaper cites a leaked document, which has been prepared by the National Police Co-ordination Centre, which warns that the ""necessity to call on military assistance is a real possibility"" after Brexit.

2018-09-09,'No campaign' to drive Labour MPs out,https://web.archive.org//web/20180909231802/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45460143,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowShadow chancellor John McDonnell has rejected suggestions that  MPs critical of Jeremy Corbyn are being driven out of the party. It follows claims by Labour MP Chuka Umunna that centre-left MPs are being run out the party, as he urged Mr Corbyn to ""call off the dogs"". Mr McDonnell branded the comments ""grossly offensive"", saying ""our party members are not dogs"". Some Labour MPs lost no-confidence votes by local party members this week. But the shadow chancellor told the BBC: ""There is no campaign directed by the leadership, or anybody as far as I can see, to drive MPs out.""Responding to Mr Umunna's comments he said it was ""unacceptable"" to refer to party members as ""dogs"".""They are the people who go out and deliver the leaflets, who canvas, who get Labour MPs elected and who secure a Labour government that will transform the lives of our country,"" he said.He told Mr Umunna: ""Stop throwing yourself in front of TV cameras, inventing stories and get out there and start campaigning for a Labour government. ""In a speech on Saturday Mr Umunna - a leading member of the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a second referendum - warned so-called moderates were being ""targeted systematically"" and faced a ""clear and present danger"" of being run out of the party by hardline factions. Some critics of Mr Corbyn have faced battles with their local parties. This week Chris Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, lost a no-confidence vote from one branch of the local party  while Enfield North's Joan Ryan and Luton South's Gavin Shuker also lost no confidence votes.Mr Leslie accused the party leadership machine of orchestrating the move.But Mr McDonnell insisted there was ""no co-ordinated campaign"" and it was ""democratic"" for members to express dissatisfaction with their local MP in this way. The votes carry no official force in the party. It comes as Mr McDonnell begins a speaking tour of the UK to highlight Conservative spending cuts.He launched the ""road to rebuilding the economy tour"" in Broxtowe, the Nottinghamshire constituency of Conservative MP Anna Soubry, on Saturday.Earlier this week, former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was ""not sure it is possible"" for Labour ""moderates"" to take the party back from Mr Corbyn and the left - and hinted at the creation of a new ""centre ground"" party.Other Labour MPs who have lost local confidence votes include Frank Field, who quit the parliamentary party last week - citing the handling of the anti-Semitism row and bullying in local constituency parties - and Kate Hoey. Graham Stringer won a confidence vote in his constituency.These ballots were organised by activists angry at Mr Field, Ms Hoey and Mr Stringer's decision to back the government in Brexit votes, which they say robbed Labour of the chance of forcing a general election it could have won."
2018-09-09,'Same roof' crime compensation rule ended,https://web.archive.org//web/20180909231802/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45462128,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Ministry of Justice is scrapping rules which prevent some victims of crime from being compensated if they lived with their attacker.The ""same roof rule"" was changed in 1979, but not retrospectively, meaning victims from before that time have been refused payouts.It is part of a government review to ""improve access"" to compensation. Justice Secretary David Gauke said he wanted to ""make sure victims get the awards they're due"".The Court of Appeal ruled in July that the pre-1979 caveat in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (CICS) had unfairly denied compensation to a claimant who was abused as a child by her stepfather.The government said it agreed with the ruling and would not appeal. The review into CICS, launched on Sunday, will also look at the existing time limit where adult victims have to apply for compensation within two years of the crime.The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said both measures would be especially relevant for victims of historic child abuse and seek to ""reflect the changing nature of crime"" and ""better support victims"". The CICS is available in England, Wales and Scotland and is funded out of government spending. Last year, it paid out more than Â£150m to victims.Claims can be made in relation to mental or physical injury, sexual or physical abuse, loss of earnings and the death of a close relative.The MoJ will also look at whether to expand the definition of a crime of violence to include sexually exploitative behaviour, such as grooming, and how victims of terrorism should be compensated. The review will look at the ""sustainability"" of the scheme and the ""affordability"" of any changes.BBC home affairs correspondent, Danny Shaw, said it would be the ""most far-reaching review of the scheme for more than 20 years"". Mr Gauke said: ""Whilst no amount of compensation can make up for the immense suffering endured by victims of violent crime, it is vital they receive the help and support needed to rebuild their lives. ""Over the years we've seen more prosecutions for sexual offences and sadly experienced the horror of terrorism. ""We need to make sure these victims get the awards they're due so we will be looking to ensure the criteria are appropriate.""The announcement was welcomed by Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan, Victim Support chief officer Diana Fawcett, and Rape Crisis co-chairwomen Dawn Thomas and Dianne Whitfield.In a joint statement, they said: ""As a coalition, we have long campaigned to get justice for victims of child sexual abuse who have lost out due to illogical rules governing the scheme.""We are glad the Ministry of Justice has listened to our concerns, so victims will at long last get the compensation they so rightly deserve.""The review will start immediately and is expected to report back to the government in 2019 with any recommendations for changes to the scheme."
2018-09-09,Ministers plan divorce law overhaul,https://web.archive.org//web/20180909231802/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45452146,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDivorce laws in England and Wales are set to be overhauled under government plans seeking to allow couples to split up more quickly and with less acrimony.Justice Secretary David Gauke, who has said the system creates ""unnecessary antagonism"", is to begin a consultation on introducing ""no-fault"" divorces.Campaigners said it could be a ""landmark moment"" for divorce law.In July, a woman's appeal for divorce was rejected by the Supreme Court due to her husband's refusal to split.Tini Owens, 68, from Worcestershire, wanted to divorce her husband of 40 years on the grounds she is unhappy. Her husband Hugh has refused the split and the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the appeal, meaning she must remain married until 2020.Under the current law in England and Wales, unless people can prove their marriage has broken down due to adultery, unreasonable behaviour or desertion, the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's consent is to live apart for five years.The government's proposals - first reported by Buzzfeed - could see the concept of fault, or blame, removed from the process. Spouses could lose the right to contest a divorce, as part of the reform.By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondentPressure has been building for decades for a system of no-fault divorce. The Law Commission recommended it in 1990 and many senior judges favour it.  The reason? Many believe that when divorcing couples are being torn apart emotionally and financially, and trying to make living arrangements for their children, assigning blame to one party can only exacerbate an already stressful process.  No-fault divorce would have been introduced in a 1996 Act of Parliament requiring spouses to attend ""information meetings"" to encourage reconciliation, but following pilot schemes, the government decided it was unworkable. The Ministry of Justice will seek to end the right of spouses to contest a divorce, and also consult on how long the parties need to wait before becoming entitled to one, suggesting a minimum of six months.  Essentially, the government is proposing a notification system where, after a defined period, if one spouse still maintains the marriage has broken down irretrievably, they become entitled to a divorce.  There will be some who fear such a system will undermine marriage, but many believe it could remove a layer of stress and anxiety from one of life's most traumatic experiences.Speaking in the House of Lords, Baroness Vere of Norbiton said the call for reform after recent judgements had been noted and the lord chancellor was ""sympathetic"" to the argument for reform.""We are looking at ways to reduce conflict in a divorce, whether that can be no-fault, whether that can be under financial provisions, whether that can be for enforceable nuptial agreements,"" she added. Nigel Shepherd, chairman of the national family lawyer's organisation Resolution, said that couples had been forced ""into needless acrimony and conflict"" under the current system, ""to satisfy an outdated legal requirement"".""Today's news has the potential to be a landmark moment for divorce law in England and Wales,"" he said.""The government appears to have heeded our calls to make our divorce system fit for the modern age, and we will continue to push for this much-needed, overdue reform to be implemented as soon as possible.""However, shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said: ""Instead of yet another consultation, the Conservatives should get on with changing our divorce laws so that they are fit for the 21st century.""Labour was ""fully committed"" to introducing no-fault divorce proceedings, he added.Jenny from Kent got divorced five years ago. Her husband divorced her on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour because it was quicker than waiting for a no-fault divorce.""I would have been quite happy to wait for the two years so that we could have had a no-fault divorce,"" she told Radio 5 live. ""The people that got caught in the middle of this were my two children because they went from seeing their parents talking and being quite amenable to each other to having real arguments and being quite nasty to each other - purely because of the process.""Law Society president Christina Blacklaws said it was time to bring divorce law ""into the 21st century"".In Scotland, a simplified divorce procedure is available (to couples without children of the marriage under 16) where people can prove their marriage is broken down with one year's separation - with consent of both partners - or two years separation without consent.In Northern Ireland, the grounds for divorce are the same as the current requirements for England and Wales. When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following five reasons:Source: Gov.UK"
2018-09-09,Blair doubts Labour can be 'taken back',https://web.archive.org//web/20180909231802/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45438855,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTony Blair says he is ""not sure it is possible"" for Labour ""moderates"" to take the party back from the left.The former Labour leader told the BBC's Nick Robinson Labour had been through a ""profound change"" under Jeremy Corbyn. ""It is a different type of Labour Party. Can it be taken back? I don't know,"" he said. Mr Corbyn responded: ""I think Tony should recognise that party membership is now much bigger than it has ever been.""Asked about his predecessor's comments, the Labour leader added: ""I've been in the Labour Party all my life. I am a socialist. I am determined to see a fairer and more equal society.""That's what the Labour Party exists for. We're there for human rights. We're there for social justice. We're there for the future of the people of this country.""It's not personal, it's about us as a movement. That's why we were founded. That's why the party is so big. And that's why I'm so confident that we are continually challenging this government and we will win a general election.""Mr Blair's invention comes as two more Corbyn critics lost no-confidence votes by local party members in their constituencies. Joan Ryan and Gavin Shuker dismissed the votes - which carry no official force in the party - and said they would carry on as usual, with Ms Ryan blaming ""Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard-left"" for the 94-92 vote defeat.Others to have lost similar votes include Frank Field, who quit the parliamentary party last week citing the handling of the anti-Semitism row and bullying in local constituency parties and Kate Hoey. Graham Stringer won a confidence vote in his constituency.Chuka Umunna, a leading member of the cross-party People's Voice campaign for a second EU referendum, has written to members of his local Labour Party in Streatham, south London, to deny reports that he is involved in talks about a new party, the New Statesman reports.Speaking on Nick Robinson's Political Thinking Podcast, Mr Blair said: ""I don't think the British people will tolerate a situation where, for example, the choice at the next election is Boris Johnson versus Jeremy Corbyn.""I don't know what will happen and I don't know how it will happen. ""But I just don't believe people will find that, in the country as a whole, an acceptable choice. Something will fill that vacuum.""He said there was a large constituency of voters who backed ""socially liberal, progressive"" politics but also believed in ""a strong private enterprise sector alongside a state that is capable of helping people"".Mr Blair's name has been linked with the formation of a new ""centre ground"" party, although he has never publicly backed the idea.And the former prime minister told Nick Robinson he was not as pessimistic as some of the people around him about the chances of his wing of the party regaining control of Labour.""There [are] lots of people associated with me who feel that the Labour Party is lost, that the game's over,"" he said.""I am hoping they are not right.""But he said the anti-Semitism row that had engulfed the party was ""bad because it has been, in the end, something that I just can't imagine ever having happened in the Labour Party that I joined"".""I can't imagine that we have had three to four months debating over something where we have profoundly insulted the Jewish community in our country,"" Mr Blair said.He said the current Labour leadership came from a left-wing tradition opposed to Western foreign policy. Those belonging to that tradition had always been ""on the margins"" of the party or in a different party, such as the Communists or ""Trotskyist groups"", he added.Mr Blair is a persistent critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership and warned in 2015 the Labour Party risked ""annihilation"" if he became leader. Last year he told the BBC he accepted it was ""possible"" that Mr Corbyn could become prime minister, in the wake of the 2017 snap election in which Labour defied predictions of a heavy defeat.Under Mr Corbyn's leadership, party membership has swelled from 388,000 at the end of 2015, to a reported 540,000 as of April 2018. Under Mr Blair's leadership it reached a peak of 405,000 in 1997 before falling to 198,000 by the time he left Downing Street.Labour backbencher Chris Williamson, an ally of Mr Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't really understand what Tony is talking about, the Labour Party now has never been more united. ""We achieved nearly 13m votes in the last election and we are giving hope to millions of people who had become really cynical about politics and inspiring people in a way that I never witnessed in my 42 years as a Labour Party member. ""So I think the party is going frankly from strength to strength."" And Jon Lansman, founder of the pro-Corbyn Momentum movement, said the party would ""never"" return to Mr Blair's policies.He said on Twitter: ""Tony Blair was never in the right party and there will never be a return to his politics in UK Labour.""The National Executive Committee member said that Blair-era policies like the minimum wage and Sure Start nurseries should be credited to other leaders.""Sure Start thanks to Gordon Brown, Min Wage thanks to John Smith, the tragic lost leader we should have had as PM in 1997,"" he wrote."

They said they would carry on as usual, with Ms Ryan blaming ""Trots, Stalinists, Communists and assorted hard-left"" for the 94-92 vote defeat. It comes as Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell prepares to begin a speaking tour of the UK in a bid to draw a line under bitter infighting in the party and push the agenda onto Conservative spending cuts, the Guardian reports.He is expected to launch the ""road to rebuilding the economy tour"" later in Broxtowe, the Nottinghamshire constituency of Conservative MP Anna Soubry, the paper says.Earlier this week, former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was ""not sure it is possible"" for Labour ""moderates"" to take the party back from Mr Corbyn and the left - and hinted at the creation of a new ""centre ground"" party.Meanwhile, Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb - a former minister - has joined the calls for another referendum, saying the public should ""decide if they are happy"" with the prime minister's deal.Mr Umunna has written to members of his local Labour Party in Streatham, south London, to deny reports that he is involved in talks about a new party, the New Statesman reports.In a speech to the Blairite campaign group Progress, the former frontbencher said MPs were being targeted for standing up for zero tolerance of racism.He said: ""My message to our leadership: it is within your power to stop this, so call off the dogs and get on with what my constituency, one of the most diverse communities in the nation, demands we do - without equivocation, fight this Tory Brexit. ""That is where all our efforts should be.""Mr Umunna told the BAME Voices for Progress conference that the Brexit debate has normalised hatred and that black and minority ethnic voters have ""paid the price"".He warned the Labour leadership it would be a ""complete betrayal"" of the party's values to ""act as a bystander and wave through this disastrous Brexit"" and called for it to back a referendum on the final deal.A Labour Party source criticised Mr Umunna's speech. They told the BBC: ""This is incoherent and inaccurate, and does a disservice to his constituents who want Labour to oppose the Tories' brutal cuts to the services our communities rely on.""Other Labour MPs who have lost local confidence votes include Frank Field, who quit the parliamentary party last week - citing the handling of the anti-Semitism row and bullying in local constituency parties - and Kate Hoey. Graham Stringer won a confidence vote in his constituency.These ballots were organised by activists angry at Mr Field, Ms Hoey and Mr Stringer's decision to back the government in Brexit votes, which they say robbed Labour of the chance of forcing a general election it could have won."
2018-09-09,Cable to quit 'once Brexit resolved',https://web.archive.org//web/20180909231802/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45438907,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSir Vince Cable will stand down as Lib Dem leader ""once Brexit is resolved or stopped""- and wants non-party members to vote for his replacement.In a speech, Sir Vince set out plans to transform the party into a ""movement for moderates"".Party sources say he wants to see this delivered while he is still leader and wants to stay in his job for crucial Brexit developments.He also wants to continue campaigning for a second EU referendum.""He has a set of objectives rather than a timeline,"" a senior Lib Dem source said. The Lib Dems have 12 MPs - down from the 57 they had in 2010. The party has struggled electorally since 2010, when it formed a coalition government with the Conservatives and remains in single figures in the opinion polls.Sir Vince has predicted a realignment of British politics, as Labour and the Conservatives split over Brexit and it is thought he wants to ensure the Lib Dems, who are campaigning for a second EU referendum, are well placed to work with any new ""centre ground"" groups.The former business secretary told an audience in Westminster: ""I think we have to recognise that despite our best efforts, the Liberal Democrats might not be the only centre force in British politics. ""I think it is the worst kept secret in Westminster that political disquiet in the two major parties, is provoking some people to consider a new party of the centre ground, or several. And I think this requires us to demand better than the usual tribalism, whether that is our own or others.""Sir Vince added: ""Liberal democracy itself is under threat notably in the USA, in eastern Europe and perhaps here. Authoritarians and extremists of both right and left are on the march."" Analysis by Chief Political Correspondent Vicki YoungSome Conservative and many more Labour MPs feel increasingly ill-at-ease with the direction their party is going in. There have been conversations over summer barbecues about creating a new party, or breaking away from the old ones but there's certainly no agreement about what happens next.             Tony Blair and Sir Vince Cable share the belief that there are millions of voters on what they call the centre ground who feel homeless. Sir Vince is offering to put a roof over their heads - but it's hard to imagine dozens of Labour MPs sidling over to the Liberal Democrats. The tribal nature of British politics is deeply ingrained.    Sir Vince's answer is to open up his party to outsiders in an attempt to attract a broader range of support and maybe a different pool of political talent. He seems to be saying to those who share his liberal values and his anti-Brexit stance, that he can supply the vehicle for their journey.But without an obvious figurehead, it's hard to see how these disparate voices can become more than a crowd of disillusioned politicians, grumbling about the status quo.     The Twickenham MP said he wanted to transform the Liberal Democrats from what he called ""an old-style political party"" into a ""movement for moderates"" and had held discussions with some unnamed Labour and Conservative MPs. He advocated a change to the party's rules, so someone who was not an MP could be leader, and ""liberal minded"" people could sign up to the Lib Dems for free and get the right to vote for the leadership.He said he did not want to follow in the footsteps of Liberal prime minister William Gladstone, who served into his 80s - or fellow octogenarian leader Robert Mugabe but added: ""Reports I have read of my imminent departure are very wide of the mark.""Now is not the time for an internal election, there is serious work for me and the party to do.""Once Brexit is resolved or stopped, that will be the time to conduct a leadership election under the new rules.""His proposed changes would have to be approved by party members and will be discussed at their conference in Brighton later this month.Sir Vince took over as leader in July 2017 without a contest following the resignation of Tim Farron.The Liberal Democrats had 99,200 members as of August 2018. The Labour Party changed its membership rules under Ed Miliband from an electoral college system in which union members, MPs and party members had one-third of the vote each to a ""one member one vote"" system, which allowed ""registered supporters"" to take part for a Â£3 fee. Labour's membership swelled in 2015 and it is thought to have had about 540,000 members as of April 2018, up from around 190,000 in 2014.But there were claims that the new rules were fuelling ""entryism"" - allowing other groups to infiltrate the party in an effort to promote their own agenda.It is thought that Sir Vince plans to rewrite the rules so that supporters need to be enrolled for 12 months before voting, to prevent infiltration by rival parties."

Mrs Bradley told House magazine, a weekly publication for the Houses of Parliament. that Northern Ireland was ""a very different world from the world I came from"" and she did not realise campaigns are generally fought within each part of the community. ""I didn't understand things like when elections are fought for example in Northern Ireland - people who are nationalists don't vote for unionist parties and vice-versa.""""So, the parties fight for election within their own community.""Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities,"" she added.Mrs Bradley was appointed in January to replace James Brokenshire.Mr Brokenshire stepped down for medical reasons.""The Northern Ireland Secretary is working incredibly hard to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland,"" a Number 10 spokeswoman said. Asked if the PM remained confident that Ms Bradley was able to do the job, the spokeswoman replied: ""Yes, she is working very closely with the parties there.""Asked how voters in Northern Ireland could have confidence in Ms Bradley, the spokeswoman replied: ""I would point to all of the work that she is doing to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland.""The South Belfast Sinn FÃ©in MLA MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir criticised Mrs Bradley: ""I knew that Karen Bradley moved particularly slowly when it came to delivering rights and justice to our community, but I didn't realise she was such a slow learner as well.""However, the East Antrim DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said Mrs Bradley's lack of knowledge was understandable.""Obviously it is going to be a steep learning curve for anyone who is coming into the Northern Ireland brief,"" he said. ""I think actually Karen Bradley was giving an honest answer about what she understood about Northern Ireland before she came in here""Labour's former Northern Ireland Secretary Shaun Woodward told the BBC that Mrs Bradley should have been better informed.He said it was a dangerous thing that Mrs Bradley went into the job ""without understanding the basics"". Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017 after a bitter row between the governing parties, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in.On Thursday Mrs Bradley announced that she intended to cut Stormont Assembly members' pay.Karen Bradley has also ruled out calling a fresh Assembly election and she is to bring forward legislation to allow civil servants to make decisions in the absence of devolution.MLA pay will fall in November from Â£49,500 to Â£35,888.In her interview with House Magazine she said: ""I had no idea how wonderful Northern Ireland was. I was slightly scared of Northern Ireland because of my impression and images from 20 years ago. That is not the place that it is today.""""I freely admit that when I started this job, I didn't understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland."""

""As friends we will continue to support our four children in the years ahead.""We will not be commenting further.""Mr Johnson and Ms Wheeler, a barrister, married in 1993 and have four children together, Lara Lettice, Milo Arthur, Cassia Peaches and Theodore Apollo. He was previously married to Allegra Mostyn-Owen, a fellow student at Oxford.News of the split follows newspaper allegations about Mr Johnson having had another extra-marital affair.In 2004, the MP was sacked from a shadow ministerial role by then Conservative leader Michael Howard for allegedly lying over an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt - something he had denied as an ""inverted pyramid of piffle"". He fronted the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum and joined Theresa May's first cabinet as foreign secretary but quit in July, shortly after his fellow cabinet Brexiteer David Davis resigned, over the prime minister's Chequers plan for the UK's future relationship with the EU.In 2016, following David Cameron's resignation, Mr Johnson dramatically ruled himself out of the race to be the next Conservative leader and prime minister, after his fellow Brexit campaigner Michael Gove's surprise announcement that he would run.But the former mayor of London and current MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip is widely thought to continue to harbour leadership ambitions.Conservative MP and digital industries minister Margot James, who has criticised the former foreign secretary in the past, said:  ""It is infuriating how Boris Johnson is continuously in the news. ""The prime minister has a really difficult job to do, with the Brexit secretary, to get the best possible deal for this country out of the EU negotiations.""I'm frankly fed up with talking about Boris Johnson"".

What is going on?In a Rotherhithe theatre hall that looks like the perfect setting for Shakespeare, Labour members gather to discuss plans to make it easier for local parties to remove their MPs. It's a meeting that's part of a ""democracy roadshow"" organised by the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting MP Chris Williamson. But talk of this tour being about plots to oust disloyal MPs is much ado about nothing, according to the Derby North MP. ""It's not a hatefest, it's a lovefest,"" Chris Williamson tells the 60 or so people who've come to hear him. Mr Williamson has been holding meetings like this one across the country all summer while the debate in Labour around the selection rules for Westminster MPs has been gaining traction.Thirteen Labour Party branches are now trying to get the issue of how MPs are selected on to the agenda at the Labour conference in Liverpool later this month.Some are calling for Labour MPs to be subject to mandatory open contests. The Jeremy Corbyn-supporting group Momentum also changed its official position earlier this week in favour of an open selection process. In the theatre hall at Rotherhithe's Sands Films Studio, almost every hand goes up when Mr Williamson asks people who support mandatory re-selection for MPs to raise their hands for a selfie. But then this is an audience made up of left-wingers - some Labour, some not - who have travelled here on a weekday evening to listen to him speak about the subject, so he's probably preaching to the converted.Among them is Pascale Mitchell, a former Liberal Democrat who joined Labour in 2013. She helped to organise the event, and invited me along to watch. She says trying to change the rules on selection isn't about getting rid of MPs who do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn. ""It means that the MPs will actually work to be more useful for the local people and the communities, because they're under a bit more scrutiny. ""I don't think it's a mechanism to get rid of MPs, I think it's a mechanism to make MPs better.""Her local Labour MP disagrees. Neil Coyle was elected in Bermondsey and Old Southwark in 2015 -pushing out Lib Dem Simon Hughes, who had held the seat for 32 years. Mr Coyle meets me in a neighbourhood in Bermondsey where knife crime claimed the life of a young man this summer. He says what voters here ""want to see is a Labour party focused on the struggle they face, on getting crime addressed"".""This is something the government's getting away with and that's something people should hear more from the Labour Party on,"" he says. ""Instead, we're spending hour after hour, day after day, week after week on internal issues that are irrelevant - by and large - not just to the majority of Labour members, but to the vast majority of voters.""Mr Coyle has been a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party. He believes that is why his constituency is one of the stops on Chris Williamson's tour - which he says is all about targeting MPs who aren't cheerleaders for the Labour leader.""This is only coming from those who think that they need more Corbyn clones in Parliament to do better,"" says Mr Coyle. ""Actually I disagree. If this system had been in place in the past who knows, Blair and New Labour could have used it to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn as an MP. ""It's a very dangerous precedent to suggest that any leader should be able to dictate who their MPs are.""The MP said there was ""already a process, the trigger ballot system, which is where members' branches and affiliates can trigger an open selection instead of the automatic retention of their sitting MP"".Under current Labour rules, sitting MPs who wish to stand for re-election are subject to a so-called ""trigger ballot"" process. If more than half of the branches and affiliates in the local constituency vote ""yes"" the MP is reselected. If they vote ""no"", then the process is put to an open selection in which other candidates can stand against the sitting MP.Chairing this democracy roadshow meeting in south London is Councillor Jack Buck. He joined Labour in 2014, is a member of Momentum and was elected to Southwark Council at the local elections in May this year.He tells me the current system is not fit for purpose.""I think that the selection procedures at the moment create quite a negative atmosphere.  ""The way in which the trigger ballot system works within the party that's been introduced creates this kind of environment of hostility, whereby anybody who wants to see thriving democratic process in the party has to vote against somebody instead of for something.""I think what Labour party members want is politicians of all stripes putting positive visions forward that they can really get behind and create an atmosphere that's policy-driven.""Policy is another key issue on the agenda at this meeting.Chris Bright, who's a member of Camberwell and Peckham CLP and the Southwark Momentum group, re-joined Labour in 2015 on the day Jeremy Corbyn became its leader, after having left the party in the 1980s.He tells me Labour needs to change to meet the needs of the more than half a million-strong membership who want more of a say in its policy direction.  ""Members generally feel that they don't have enough input into policy-making. ""We've got a much bigger membership now than in the past and those people want to get engaged in decisions about the direction of the party, national policy, local policy and we feel that the Labour party should be responsive to that and give ordinary members more of an input.""Labour's Democracy Review has been looking at how the grassroots could have a greater say in party matters, and was discussed by the party's ruling body - the National Executive Committee - this week. But de-selection hasn't been included in the review. Speaking to me in Rotherhithe, Chris Williamson said that was why local Labour branches across the country are making their own submissions to get the subject on the agenda at conference.""The mandatory re-selection is not actually part of the terms of reference of the democracy review.""There are a few motions that have been forwarded by constituency parties. ""The one that I'm backing and I hope that will get support is the one that's been put forward by Labour International, which is calling for open selections so that sitting MPs are subject to an endorsement process between three years and four years into their term of office.""If the motion does make it onto the conference agenda in Liverpool and enough Labour members vote for it, it could end up becoming party policy."
2018-09-09,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180909231802/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45440025,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowGovernment plans to allow UK fruit and vegetable growers to recruit non-EU seasonal workers after Brexit have been criticised inside the industry as insufficient. The government's proposed pilot scheme would allow the recruitment of up to 2,500 workers on six-month visas between the spring of 2019 and December 2020. The National Farmers Union (NFU) said the government's announcement was a ""major victory"" after two years of evidence that ""a shortage of workers has been hampering food production"". But British Summer Fruits - the industry body representing companies that supply fresh berries in UK supermarkets - says it's not enough. According to British Summer Fruits, farms are already reporting staff shortages of between 10% and 20%.The NFU estimates that 60,000 seasonal workers are employed in UK horticulture every year. If that's right, then 10% to 20% would imply a range of between 6,000 and 12,000 workers per year, although other estimates believe the figure is higher. What is clear is that the overwhelming majority of those workers had - in previous years - come from Central and Eastern Europe.  The NFU says roughly 67% have come from Romania and Bulgaria, 23% from eight other Central and Eastern European countries in the EU, and just 1% from the UK itself. Fewer seasonal workers have been coming to the UK from Central and Eastern Europe since the Brexit referendum, partly because of the decline in the value of the pound, which makes the amount paid to EU workers worth less when they return home and convert it into euros.It is also partly because other EU countries such as Germany are making greater efforts to attract seasonal workers. There is also the argument - which is more difficult to quantify - that EU workers feel less welcome than they did before. Whatever the precise reasons, the vast majority of fruit growers are worried that shortages of seasonal workers are going to get worse. There has already been an impact.In 2017, the NFU says, wages increased by an average of 9% compared with 2016. But the shortages were still there and there was no sign of more local workers signing up for the work. There has been plenty of anecdotal information about fruit left rotting in the fields - but it's hard to get any overall figures for the amount of fruit that may have been left on the plants across the UK.There are some clues out there, though.Angus Growers - based in Arbroath on the east coast of Scotland - says it was unable to pick 83.5 tonnes of soft fruit with an estimated value of Â£416,000 last year, because of a shortage of labour. Overall, it says, the total shortage of work days (the number of people multiplied by the number of days work missed) was 7,944. British Summer Fruits estimates that Angus Growers represents about 10% of the UK berry production.It is only one example but other companies tell similar stories. And the concern is that future growth in the sector is under threat. The government's proposed pilot scheme represents ""a 4% increase in a shrinking workforce"", says Nick Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits. ""The UK berry industry grows by at least 8% per annum and this [the government's plan] will not sustain a standstill, let alone growth."" Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs suggest those fears have not yet been realised. They say there was production of Â£541m of soft fruit in 2017, up from Â£495m in 2016. In the same period, orchard fruit rose from Â£205m to Â£224m.But labour shortages are certainly beginning to bite. The last time the UK had a seasonal agricultural worker scheme in 2013, 21,250 workers were allowed into the UK from Bulgaria and Romania before they gained full EU rights to freedom of movement.And many people in the industry believe similar numbers will be needed in the future. The government has suggested that it is willing to listen. ""We will review the pilot's results,"" said the Environment Secretary Michael Gove, ""as we look at how best to support the longer-term needs of industry outside the EU.""What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-09-09,The Brexiteers' alternative?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180909231802/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45423791,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAs Westminster is settling down to the next phase of its collective mild nervous breakdown, the pushback to Brexiteers' criticism of Theresa May's Chequers plan is that the naysayers don't have their own. It's not that far off from saying 'come and have a go if you think you're hard enough'!Or, in more polite terms, the kind that your parents might have advised, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. Those in government are deeply frustrated that they get knocked about by criticism from Brexiteers (and not just Boris Johnson, honest) who are right now engaged in an overt plan to kill off the prime minister's plan, based on months of work,  but are yet to front up with their own proposal. In the coming days, the Brexiteers, organised behind the scenes by that powerful grouping, the ERG, which regular readers here will be very familiar with, have a plan to counter that accusation.I hear from Sunday onwards we should expect several days of carefully planned announcements, almost like a government grid perhaps, where the Brexiteers, with their eyes ruthlessly on their short term prize of ""chucking Chequers"", will lay out an alternative. A roll out of written papers will begin over the weekend, with a big event expected in Westminster on Monday which, if it comes off, would just by chance coincide with Boris Johnson's next newspaper column. Plans, which are in this very febrile environment subject to a whole lot of change, are right now for a push on Sunday to make the argument for a free trade agreement, rather than Chequers.On Monday, we should see an explanation of the Brexiteers' vision for money and migration, and then on Wednesday for solutions to be presented for the crucial Northern Irish border question and other issues like agriculture and fishing. The idea is not, sources say crucially, to put pressure directly on Theresa May to trigger some kind of putsch. But don't be in any doubt, it is a carefully worked-through plan designed to present alternatives to what the government has put on the table, calculated to force the prime minister to ditch the policy. Of course, by publishing their own plans, the Brexiteers' will submit themselves to the same kind of scrutiny that the government itself has. It is one thing, they are well aware, to be merely critics, quite another to commit to alternatives that it's likely Number 10 will waste little time in tearing down. The emerging consensus among Brexiteers seems to be that it is better to present an alternative that will be open to criticism, than face the charge of having no worked out ideas of their own. The idea, when ministers say to MPs 'well it's Chequers or nothing', is their solution can fill in that blank. And to try, notably, to make Theresa May perform a huge U-turn before the Tory conference and admit, whether privately, tacitly, or publicly, that the July settlement simply can't stand.Those involved in designing the ""chuck Chequers"" plan are careful to point out that they would absolutely support the prime minister in shifting position. The condition being, if she does their bidding, they won't seek to damage her further. The political truth is too that while many Brexiteers would be ruthless in trying to achieve their political goal, their aim right now, and this goes for Boris Johnson too, is that the target is changing the policy, not changing the Tory party's leader. Yet for those in government right now, there is no question whatsoever of ditching the Chequers deal. Remember it's only the basis for a negotiation, and it took the government two years (yes two years) to come to that position. And insiders say for all the claims of Chequers being dead, in fact it will to a large extent be part of the eventual deal. In other words, remember, remember, remember Chequers was always a document from which a negotiation would finally start, and inside government there is still a strong belief that elements of it will survive. There's an acknowledgement inside government too that the next few weeks will be extremely testing. But right now, there is not even a sniff that they would be able, even if willing, to give one inch to the Brexiteers. But they are organised, determined and willing to try to force her to move, and might have more in their armoury if the prime minister sticks to her ground.  "
2018-09-09,All-female government,https://web.archive.org//web/20180909231802/https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-45117794,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMen have been cleared out of government and the women are in charge. That's the premise of a play, opening on Thursday, which has been collectively written by a group of leading female figures. The Assemblywomen by the Greek playwright Aristophanes was first written in 391 BC.Back then, a play about the women of Athens dressed as men (complete with fake beards) storming the Assembly and taking charge was seen as a totally unrealistic premise.Indeed, that was one of the reasons it worked as a comedy - and made for the perfect vehicle for the playwright to criticise the Athenian government at the time. Now, a group of leading female figures - among them poets, writers, comedians, broadcasters and politicians - have given the show a makeover, and the newly-titled Women in Power opens this week.Director Sam Hodges says the current political and social turmoil was the catalyst for bringing back a play which he describes as ""deeply resonant"" today.But things have, of course, changed dramatically since it was first written. Many leading female figures now spring to mind in the world of politics and public service.There's Prime Minister Theresa May. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The Commissioner of the Met Police, Cressida Dick. German Chancellor Angela Merkel.But the fact that a select few names always spring to mind is precisely why more progress needs to be made, argues Labour MP Jess Phillips, who's written Women in Power's opening scene.""You couldn't name all the men who are in power in the world right now could you?"" she asks BBC News.The backbencher adds the number of women in power will only be noteworthy when ""we can no longer list them because it's just the norm and there are so many"".""We're noticing it because it's a good thing, but the FTSE 100 companies, there's like 10 women out of 100, so we're still a very long way off.""(It's actually even fewer than that, seven out of 100 of the CEOs are women - there are more men called David or Steven in the top 100 then there are women.)But in the media and entertainment landscape, women are starting to have much more visibility.All female line-ups are very much in fashion, whether it's on panel shows or in Hollywood films like Ocean's 8 and Ghostbusters.Not everyone is happy about such things of course - the Ghostbusters trailer became the most disliked in YouTube history, while some critics said Ocean's 8 wouldn't have been as successful if it hadn't piggy-backed on a male franchise.On Monday, the BBC's new political show Politics Live took some viewers by surprise with its all-female line-up.Presenter Jo Coburn presided over a panel which included former home secretary Amber Rudd and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, alongside the corporation's political editor Laura Kuenssberg.While something unimaginable in Aristophanes's day may well now be seen as progressive - not all viewers were happy.The Daily Mail, The Guardian and The Daily Express picked up on the backlash to the all-female panel, with many on social media criticising ""woke producers"" for putting political correctness and virtue signalling ahead of editorial values. Editor Rob Burley  defended the show on Twitter, writing that he had ""literally zero shame"" about having an all-female panel.Similarly, Women in Power is a play which will likely have some people rolling their eyes at what could be perceived as yet another example of men being actively removed or excluded from a project.Comedian Shappi Khorsandi, who has also written a scene for the show, has some sympathy for the position many modern men find themselves in, adding that they shouldn't feel threatened by pro-women projects such as this.""It will be a real shame if [men feeling attacked] put them off coming, because in a play, things are longer, more nuanced, more humorous, and with actors, you can see the whites of their eyes, you have a connection,"" she says.""Men are in a difficult position in some ways. On the one hand, we're all up in arms about mental health - the fact that the biggest killer of men under 50 is suicide. And yet, on the other, we're peddling this narrative of white middle class men having no right to an input.""So on the one hand we're like, we've got to listen to them all, on another we're telling them to shut up.""Phillips adds: ""It's not intended to attack men. I don't hate men, I've got two sons for god's sake. I love men.""But the fact of the matter is there's still a massive equality imbalance. And if men feel under attack, all that is is a bit of their privilege being chipped away. ""And that's okay, they should want to share it. They should want what they have, whether it's economic stability or personal safety, to be shared. It's not an attack, it's an equalisation.""Writer Wendy Cope, comedian Jenny Eclair and broadcaster Natalie Haynes are among the other names to have contributed scenes to Women in Power.The play, though humorous, explores some quite serious and nuanced themes about the differences between the ways men and women operate, and the merits of each.""The big difference with men and women is that women form alliances,"" says Khorsandi.""They form unbreakable bonds and pacts with one another, and they get into gangs and cliques. And the pressure with women is to be a friend or a foe. ""Whereas men disagree, they argue, they fall out, they have philosophical differences, but they put them down and have a beer together afterwards. They separate emotional attachment from debate.""Phillips adds: ""If women were to be completely in power for even just a month in the UK, there would be a huge change in the decisions that get made.""""I think women are better at taking risks in lots of places. I think women are much more likely to work with each other to try and find a way through. ""In my experience, women work across barriers and assess humanity in a different way in politics... they would be able to progress things quicker because we're much more likely to work together to get a common goal. ""So yeah I think it would potentially be more efficient. It would also potentially just be pleasant. It would stop being about who's the best and start being much more about the country.""So, is Phillips' reason for getting involved in writing the play an attempt to further boost her profile, perhaps a result of leadership ambitions herself?""Oh god no, I'm just useless at saying no to things,"" she laughs, ""which is a very female trait!""Women in Power opens on Thursday at the NST City (at the Nuffield Southampton Theatres), and moves to the Oxford Playhouse in October."

2018-09-09,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180909231802/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to Â£40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-09,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180909231802/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

2018-09-10,November Brexit deal is doable - Barnier,https://web.archive.org//web/20180910234303/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45470674,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMichel Barnier has said a Brexit deal is possible within six to eight weeks. The EU's chief negotiator said if both sides are ""realistic"" there could be an agreement on the terms of the UK's exit by early November.His comments come amid unconfirmed reports a one-off summit of EU leaders could be convened in the middle of November to sign off the agreement.The BBC's Katya Adler said Mr Barnier's tone may have changed but the substance of his arguments was still the same. While the EU was not about to compromise its Brexit principles, our Europe editor said the bloc was aware of Mrs May's domestic political troubles and ""planned to throw her as much of a lifeline as possible"". Mrs May has been warned she faces a mass Tory rebellion if she persists with her Chequers plan for future relations with the EU, with former Brexit minister Steve Baker claiming as many as 80 Tories could oppose it in a Commons vote later this year. The UK and EU are hoping to finalise the so-called divorce agreement and agree a statement on their future economic co-operation in time for an EU summit in mid-October or by the end of the month at the latest.Mr Barnier has said this is vital if the UK and EU Parliaments are to have enough time to consider and vote on the proposals before the UK's scheduled departure on 29 March 2019. But some senior Tory Brexiteers are continuing to urge the PM to change course, saying proposals agreed by her cabinet in July - which would see the UK follow EU rules on trade in goods - will not be backed by Parliament.Mr Baker said the party risked a ""catastrophic split"" if the PM didn't rethink her approach, which he suggested many MPs - including some who backed Remain - thought was worse than staying in the EU as it would leave the UK without any say in its rules.A key argument that has been made by MPs opposed to the Chequers deal in recent weeks is that the EU will not accept it, since it seeks different levels of market access and obligations for goods and services. After meeting Mr Barnier last week, Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Frenchman's views were closer to his than those of the prime minister while Labour MP Stephen Kinnock claimed he told him and other MPs that, referring to the Chequers plan, ""les propositions sont mortes"" (the proposals are dead).But asked about this at the Bled Strategic Forum in Slovenia, Mr Barnier said this was not true. ""I never said that, I don't think that. It is not my feeling.""He described the Chequers plan as a ""very important"" document and suggested the EU was now ""benchmarking"" it against the mandate it had been given by the EU's 27 other members.""It is useful because it clearly defines what the wishes are for the UK for future relations.""Mr Barnier said there was ""many, many points of convergence"" between the two sides, particularly over defence and security and a deal on the terms of withdrawal could be settled within six to eight weeks.But he warned that the UK's core proposals for trading relations after it leaves were a direct challenge to the founding principles of the EU and the integrity of the single market. ""It is not possible to get freedom for goods without freedom for services, in particular for the movement of people,"" he said.The BBC's Katya Adler said there was a suggestion EU leaders might be preparing to give Mr Barnier an updated negotiating mandate when they meet in Salzburg later this month, but that any changes were likely to be ""pretty cosmetic"" rather than a fundamental change in the EU's negotiating position.The talk in Brussels among senior EU officials is increasingly of a special Brexit summit in the week commencing 12 November, if as is widely expected, a deal cannot be struck in October. The Chequers agreement led to the resignations of then-Brexit Secretary David Davis and the former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, both of whom have continued to criticise the direction of government policy. Mr Johnson caused controversy over the weekend with a column in the Mail on Sunday, calling the PM's plan a ""suicide vest"" around the UK, with the detonator in Brussels' hands. No 10 has said its plan was the ""only one on the table"" able to deliver on the will of British people while avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. Asked when Brexiteers outside of the government would come up with a detailed alternative, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said he and others would be putting forward a ""whole set of new ideas"" in the coming weeks but it was up to ministers to mould them into a plan that would be approved by Parliament.

""We must focus on that priority and turn our fire outwards.""On the confidence votes in local parties, a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had told MPs that ""it is not his place to be involved in the democratic practices of different parts of the Labour Party"", the Press Association reported.He added: ""He was making the point that everybody is subject to democratic accountability. It's not his role to interfere with that.""But obviously these things have to be conducted properly and thoroughly and without abuse and Jeremy reiterated... that our politics is conducted with respect and without abuse of any kind.""Shadow chancellor John McDonnell rejected claims Labour MPs who had criticised Mr Corbyn were being forced out of the party by far left activists.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm sorry, that does not bear relation to reality.""We now have 500,000 members. It's a huge mass party now and, of course, those members want to get involved in discussions about policy.""Also, they will reflect at times their view about the performances of their local MP. ""And we have had a small number of incidences that we have seen, two or three, where parties have come together and they have expressed concerns about the performance of their MP. That's happened right the way through the history of our party, but it's nothing untoward."""
2018-09-10,Commons seat cut proposals published,https://web.archive.org//web/20180910234303/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45468142,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFinal recommendations for new parliamentary boundaries that could see the number of MPs cut from 650 to 600 will be published later.The Boundary Commission for England submitted its proposals to the government, but they must now be presented to Parliament. The commission said it was ""confident"" in its new map, which covers constituencies across the UK. Parliament approved the principle of reducing the number of MPs in 2011.Since then, the Boundary Commissions of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were meant to redraw the UK's political map every five years to take account of changes in population shifts.The reduction in the number of parliamentary constituencies was meant to happen while the Coalition government was in power between 2010 to 2015.But it was abandoned in 2013 after the Liberal Democrats withdrew their support, having failed to agree on House of Lords reform with their Tory partners.As a result, the 2015 election was fought on the same boundaries as in 2010, as was the snap general election in 2017.  The proposed number of seats for the next election are:As well as reducing the number of seats, the review aims to make constituencies more equal in size, in terms of their total number of voters -  between 71,031 and 78,507.The Commission's earlier proposals - based on the electoral register from December 2015 - have been significantly altered following a public consultation, in which thousands of responses were received.If MPs reject the proposals, the next election will be fought on demographic data based on the 2000 electoral register and will not take into account changes since then.Secretary to the commission, Sam Hartley, said: ""We're confident that the new map of constituencies best reflects the rules set for us by Parliament and we're especially pleased that our recommendations are based heavily on what members of the public have told us about their local areas. ""It is now up to the government to present our report to Parliament, and we look forward to being able to publish our recommendations once that has happened.""The BBC's political correspondent, Peter Saull, said critics of the changes have warned that Brexit will mean more legislation in the coming years - and fewer MPs means less parliamentary scrutiny. He added that Labour had accused the government of ""gerrymandering"", with the changes expected to most benefit the Conservatives at the ballot box. But the Tories have insisted the system is currently weighed against them and the boundaries - decided by population figures - are out of date. "

The construction sector expanded but industrial output contracted.""The dominant service sector again led economic growth in the month of July with engineers, accountants and lawyers all enjoying a busy period, backed up by growth in construction, which hit another record high level,"" said Mr Kent-Smith.The 0.6% growth rate for the three months to July was at the fastest since August 2017, the ONS said, and marks a pick-up from the 0.4% rate seen in the three months to June.The data comes ahead of the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting on Thursday when interest rates are not expected to change. They were raised in August, for only the second time a decade, to 0.75%.John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said the latest data justified the decision to raise rates last month. However, he remained cautious due to the possible impact of Brexit.""Looking ahead... the long hot summer could give way to a stormy autumn as Brexit-related uncertainty leads businesses to defer major investment decisions and subdued real wage growth weighs on consumer spending,"" he said.By Andy Verity, BBC economics correspondentToday's economic growth figures contain a few pleasant surprises as the economic climate mirrored the meteorological one.You will have heard about gloom on the High Street: the figures show activity in the retail sector growing in the summer heat. You knew construction was in a hole: in the three months to July it started climbing back out - up 3.3%. Services drove growth, rebounding from a flat few months before. Professional services - engineers, architects etc - had a particularly busy three months, up 4.4%. No sign there yet of a Brexit-induced slump.Hotels, camping grounds and trailer parks also enjoyed growth of 3.4% - made more attractive to foreign tourists by the weak pound. Yes there may be clouds on the horizon; but don't get your umbrella out just yet. The ONS published a string of data alongside the GDP estimate: Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said there had been a ""solid start"" to the third quarter but that each of the sectors showed a mixed picture. ""Uncertainties and risks around Brexit are likely to make the Bank of England particularly cautious during the critical months ahead. We expected a pause before interest rates are raised by 0.25% in November 2019 to 1%,"" she said."

The MPs Emma Reynolds, Dan Jarvis, Anna Turley, Steve Reed and Justin Madders are among those who have contributed to the book, entitled ""Spirit of Britain, Purpose of Labour"". The policies put forward include adult education funds for people who don't go to university, government-funded training days for all workers and a decentralised national curriculum for schools. Baby boxes, already provided to prospective parents in Scotland, should be introduced UK-wide to help improve life chances and reduce infant deaths, claims Dan Jarvis MP, who has written a chapter on education. He suggests a new National Institute of Educational and Training Excellence should be given power to set the school curriculum.Among the housing policies suggested by the group are restrictions on foreign ownership, an overhaul of the land market and giving local authorities the power to speed up building.Labour's current target to build one million new homes by 2022 is ""realistic albeit very ambitious,"" according to Emma Reynolds MP.She says the government's Rent to Buy and Help to Buy schemes had made the UK's housing problem ""worse not better"" and ""helped stoke demand and done nothing to increase supply"".In the book's foreword, Mr Kinnock says he hopes the Labour leadership will see the book as ""a set of constructive proposals"" which would ""dramatically increase our changes of forming the next government"".Speaking at the launch, he described a Britain as being in a ""dangerously polarised state"" and more divided than any time since the Second World War. In what appeared to be an attack on Mr Corbyn, Mr Kinnock said a minority within the party had a ""conspiracy-driven world view"".Those people, he said, saw Nato as a ""warmongering junta"" and were guilty of a ""foot-dragging reluctance"" to condemn Russia for the Salisbury attack. Asked if he thought Mr Corbyn himself believed in Britain, Mr Kinnock said ""the jury is out"" and described the party leader as being ""on a journey."" He added that Labour's 2017 general election result was encouraging, but that the party had struggled to win votes in its ""communitarian heartlands.""""We struggled amongst those who left school at 16, the over 50s and lost to the Tories in seats such as Mansfield and Middlesbrough.""The result demonstrated the need for Labour to ""return to the first principles of our foundation as a party"", he added.

2018-09-10,Unions call for four-day working week,https://web.archive.org//web/20180910234303/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45463868,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA four-day working week will be possible this century if businesses are forced to share the benefits of new technology with their workforce. That's the claim from the TUC, which is using its annual conference to call on the government to take action to help people work less but get paid the same. Artificial intelligence, robotics and automation could provide a Â£200bn UK economic boost in the next decade. At one Welsh firm staff already get a full salary for four days work.Mark Hooper, founder of Cardiff-based IndyCube, said the transition to this new working arrangement over the last 18 months had not always been easy. ""We felt we had an opportunity to prove something, that you can be as productive in four days as five, and it has been worth it,"" he said. Now the company is outputting more and expanding outside of Wales. His colleague Russ Todd spreads his time out to help with school runs and family time.""My father would work long hours. He was up before I was up and he was home after I went to bed,"" he said. ""It is important to be there. It matters."" Employee Mari Dunning has used some of her extra time to get a collection of poetry published, amongst more menial tasks. Or if you use the extra day to get the housework done, ""you've then got your weekend wide open"", she said.""I don't see why four days is not doable for most people,"" she added.But for most British workers the trend is going in the other direction. Some 1.4 million people now work a full seven days a week in the UK, according to the TUC, and 51% of people they surveyed said they feared the benefits of new technology would go to company managers and shareholders. A report this January from Centre for Cities found that 3.6m UK jobs could be replaced by machines by 2030.The TUC's general secretary Frances O'Grady highlighted that unions had fought for two-day weekends and limits on long hours - and that this is their next challenge. ""We know that some people are pessimistic about whether technology will make their lives better but technology could be a force for good, we can also make everyone's working lives better and richer,"" she explained.  ""It doesn't have to be about surveillance and exploitation. This could be about creating more satisfying work.""But that may not be easy. The Communication and Workers Union just took on that fight - to have the benefits of automation evenly shared - at the Royal Mail.When the postal service invested in new sorting machines - thus cutting down on the amount of time workers were needed to sort out packages - it wanted the staff to work extended delivery rounds instead. Terry Pullinger was the lead union rep on the dispute that took two years to resolve.""Our objective was to work towards a 35-hour week,"" he said. ""Crucial to us was to protect as many jobs as possible with the technology that is coming in, which is taking out a lot of the work that our members are doing. And fortunately we ended up in a situation where the employer agreed with us.""  He added: ""People are finding that they're being pushed to work harder, [but] how much can people take?"""

In the Mail on Sunday, the former foreign secretary said the Chequers deal was ""feeble"" and ""pathetic"".He has been strongly criticised by some Tories - one minister said it marked a ""disgusting moment"" in politics.And Home Secretary Sajid Javid called for ""measured language"" to be used.Writing in the same paper, the current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for people to rally behind Mrs May, backing her to hold the line ""in the face of intense pressure"".The UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, and the government's plan - agreed at Chequers in July - has sparked criticism from Brexiteer Tories as well as the EU.In his article, Mr Johnson accused the EU of ""bullying"" the UK - but questioned why the response had been ""so utterly feeble"". He said that rather than getting a ""generous free trade deal"", Britain is saying, ""yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir"", to Brussels. ""At every stage of the talks so far, Brussels gets what Brussels wants,"" wrote Mr Johnson. ""It is a humiliation. We look like a seven-stone weakling being comically bent out of shape by a 500lb gorilla.""He said the reason for the UK's response was the ""insanity of the so-called backstop"" - the commitment by the UK and the EU to come up with a solution to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.However, his call to scrap the proposed backstop has been heavily criticised by Sinn FÃ©in and the SDLP. Sinn Fein said Mr Johnson's comments were ""foolish and dangerous"", while the SDLP said he had ""absolutely no regard for people on this island"".The BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the ""scathing remarks"" by Mr Johnson showed his ""willingness to challenge the prime minister remains undimmed"" after recent revelations about his private life.It is Mr Johnson's second attack on the prime minister's Brexit strategy inside a week, as last Monday he said the Chequers deal ""means disaster"" for Britain - Downing Street responded to that attack by saying he had offered ""no new ideas"".While Mr Javid voiced measured criticism of Mr Johnson, other Tories reacted more angrily to his remarks.Former Army officer and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat graphically described the aftermath of a suicide bomb that had gone off near his office in Helmand province, Afghanistan.He said comparing such an attack to the PM's plans ""isn't funny"", adding: ""Some need to grow up"".Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan criticised his former boss, saying the article was ""one of the most disgusting moments in modern British politics.""  If this latest broadside was not the end of Mr Johnson's political career, ""I will make sure it is later"", he said.Another Foreign Office minister, Alistair Burt, tweeted: ""I'm stunned at the nature of this attack. There is no justification for such an outrageous, inappropriate and hurtful analogy.""If we don't stop this extraordinary use of language over Brexit, our country might never heal. Again, I say, enough.""But backbench Tory MP Nadine Dorries defended Mr Johnson in the face of what she was ""vitriol"", saying his critics were ""terrified of his popular appeal"".And Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said the way Mr Johnson ""says it how he sees it and speaks truth unto power"" was ""something that endears him to a huge swathe of the British public"".On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid said: ""I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences. I think it's a reminder for all of us in public policy, whichever political party we represent, to use measured language because I think that's what the public want to see.""He backed the Chequers proposals which he said represented ""the only deal that we've got on the table"".In his Mail on Sunday article, Mr Hunt said Parliament would get to debate and vote on any agreement, adding: ""Until then, we should not rush to judgement on a deal that is still under negotiation.""It is the first public comment from Mr Johnson since he and his wife, Marina Wheeler, confirmed they were getting divorced earlier this week.The announcement followed newspaper allegations the former London mayor had been having an extra-marital affair.The Sunday Times has reported that Mrs May's aides wrote a 4,000-word ""dirty dossier"" on Mr Johnson in 2016, exposing a ""catalogue of lurid allegations"" against him. The paper says it has seen the document - said to have been written during the Conservative leadership contest - but officials at Downing Street and Conservative Campaign Headquarters have denied circulating it.Elsewhere the National Police Chiefs' Council said there was no intelligence to suggest there would be an increase in crime or disorder if the UK and the EU cannot agree a deal.NPCC operations lead Chief Constable Charlie Hall was responding to a Sunday Times report of a leaked document about police contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit.According to the paper, the document warned that concerns around medical supplies could ""feed civil disorder"", and that potential goods shortages raised concerns of ""widespread protest which could then escalate into disorder"".It also warned that the ""necessity to call on military assistance is a real possibility"" in the weeks after UK's departure from the EU.Mr Javid said he did not expect a no-deal outcome, adding: ""I'm glad the police and other experts are looking into this and thinking what might happen in a no-deal scenario."""

He went on to say that the UK had ""considerable powers"" to respond to Russia.""We will bring all those powers, both overt and covert, to bear on Russia and what it represents today."""

In an interview in the Sunday Times, George Hamilton warns that the government is failing to prepare for the impact of the UK leaving the EU on the peace and security in NI. He said that he is not getting the information and clarity needed.Mr Hamilton said that some Westminster politicians view NI as ""peripheral"".""There's a feeling that as regards the Troubles and the conflict, Northern Ireland is sorted and we don't need to worry about it, when actually we're working flat out 24/7 to keep a lid on it,"" he said.Mr Hamilton issued a similar warning when he appeared before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in June.In the Sunday Times interview, he said that any physical infrastructure or border officials following the UK's withdrawal from the European Union would become targets for dissident republicans and require police protection.""The purpose for which those checking points and [Irish] border controls would be put in place would become less and less relevant because they would move away from issues of trade or movement of people to old-fashioned security on a national frontier,"" he said. ""That was done during the period of the Troubles rather unsuccessfully, and was sadly the subject of attacks and many lives lost.""Asked if the government understood Brexit's potential consequences for Northern Ireland, Mr Hamilton said: ""I'm not sure all of them do. ""I have a concern some may see issues to do with the Irish border as literally peripheral, not just geographically but in terms of impact.""The Sunday Times also reports that police chiefs elsewhere in the UK are drawing up contingency plans to deal with ""wide spread civil disorder"" at the UK's borders and ports. The newspaper cites a leaked document, which has been prepared by the National Police Co-ordination Centre, which warns that the ""necessity to call on military assistance is a real possibility"" after Brexit.

It follows claims by Labour MP Chuka Umunna that centre-left MPs are being run out the party, as he urged Mr Corbyn to ""call off the dogs"". Mr McDonnell branded the comments ""grossly offensive"", saying ""our party members are not dogs"". Some Labour MPs lost no-confidence votes by local party members this week. But the shadow chancellor told the BBC: ""There is no campaign directed by the leadership, or anybody as far as I can see, to drive MPs out.""Responding to Mr Umunna's comments he said it was ""unacceptable"" to refer to party members as ""dogs"".""They are the people who go out and deliver the leaflets, who canvas, who get Labour MPs elected and who secure a Labour government that will transform the lives of our country,"" he said.He told Mr Umunna: ""Stop throwing yourself in front of TV cameras, inventing stories and get out there and start campaigning for a Labour government. ""In a speech on Saturday Mr Umunna - a leading member of the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a second referendum - warned so-called moderates were being ""targeted systematically"" and faced a ""clear and present danger"" of being run out of the party by hardline factions. Some critics of Mr Corbyn have faced battles with their local parties. This week Chris Leslie, MP for Nottingham East, lost a no-confidence vote from one branch of the local party  while Enfield North's Joan Ryan and Luton South's Gavin Shuker also lost no confidence votes.Mr Leslie accused the party leadership machine of orchestrating the move.But Mr McDonnell insisted there was ""no co-ordinated campaign"" and it was ""democratic"" for members to express dissatisfaction with their local MP in this way. The votes carry no official force in the party. It comes as Mr McDonnell begins a speaking tour of the UK to highlight Conservative spending cuts.He launched the ""road to rebuilding the economy tour"" in Broxtowe, the Nottinghamshire constituency of Conservative MP Anna Soubry, on Saturday.Earlier this week, former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was ""not sure it is possible"" for Labour ""moderates"" to take the party back from Mr Corbyn and the left - and hinted at the creation of a new ""centre ground"" party.Other Labour MPs who have lost local confidence votes include Frank Field, who quit the parliamentary party last week - citing the handling of the anti-Semitism row and bullying in local constituency parties - and Kate Hoey. Graham Stringer won a confidence vote in his constituency.These ballots were organised by activists angry at Mr Field, Ms Hoey and Mr Stringer's decision to back the government in Brexit votes, which they say robbed Labour of the chance of forcing a general election it could have won."

The leadership of the rail union, the RMT, oppose a new vote. On the other side, there is a vanguard pushing for a referendum on the final Brussels deal no matter what.  This includes the GMB and the smaller Community and TSSA unions.So away from public view the shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer spent his Sunday in what are, these days, smoke-free rooms sounding out what the big unions will do in two weeks' time at Labour's conference.His mission is to try to find consensus and avoid conflict before all eyes turn to the Conservative conference a week later.So he wanted to find out if the largest union backing a 'people's vote' - the GMB - would press for Labour to adopt the same policy.I understand he was told they will.Currently the Labour leadership insist they would prefer to call for an election if Parliament either rejects Theresa May's final deal, or if she returns from Brussels empty-handed.A referendum, though, wouldn't be off the table as an option.Not just some unions, but many rank-and-file Labour members want their leadership to go further.So I'm told Sir Keir is trying to find ""a form of words"" to paper over any underlying differences before the party gathers in Liverpool.And Frances O'Grady's language at the TUC conference could provide the blueprint.In words and phrases that could only really be written by a committee, the TUC - including the big Labour supporting unions Unison and Unite - will formally agree a motion on the conference floor today backing ""the possibility of a campaign for people to have a final say on the final Brexit deal through a popular vote"".But more robustly, the TUC's general secretary adds that if this were to happen, then unions' ""full weight"" would be behind that campaign.And it is felt that if the Labour leadership could sound more enthusiastic about the prospect - rather than appearing to be being dragged reluctantly towards it - that might just be enough to keep the Remainers in Labour's ranks from publicly revolting.Unite's Len McCluskey - whose position is close to Jeremy Corbyn's - is stressing a new vote should be left ""on the table"".For Kremlinologists, that's more positive than the previous formulation of ""not taking it off the table"".But one thing is clear - the Labour leadership won't agree to back a new vote in all circumstances.If their language does become more positive, caveats will remain - and any support for a new referendum would only be triggered if Parliament can't agree a deal with Brussels."

ASI was called in because of its success in making tools to automatically spot videos made by the Islamic State group being spread on social media.Those well-produced ""official"" videos were key to the radicalisation of many people who carried out ""lone wolf"" attacks in London and other cities, said Mr Gibson.""There are particular classes of video that cause the real damage,"" he said. ""They are slick and well-produced. ""The quality of the content matters because you can start to persuade people that are sceptical. These are so troubling because they are so visceral.""As the Deep Fake technology improves, it might be used to generate the convincing clips that can significantly damage debate and undermine legitimate elections.Big web platforms such as Facebook and YouTube did a lot of their own work to find and flush out IS propaganda, said Mr Gibson, but smaller firms need help to scrutinise the huge amount of video flowing online. The same will be true of Deep Fakes. Systems based around machine learning and AI can do the job of finding content and processing video far faster than humans can, he said.Research suggests that the IS videos appeared online via more than 400 different platforms, said Mr Gibson. The Deep Fakes are likely to be uploaded through at least as many routes.""If you are spreading fake news it does not matter to you where it is, it's not like you get more status if it's on YouTube,"" he said. ""You just want people to look at it.""As long as it is on the open web and as long as you can cut and paste a link to it in a message the job is basically done,"" he told the BBC.There have already been efforts to combat election interference, most particularly during Mexico's recent presidential election.""Mexico has a long history of social network manipulation that goes way back,"" said Tom Trewinnard, director of programmes at media firm Meedan which helped to run a project to combat fake news and disinformation in the country called Verificado.The electronic disruption intensified during the 2018 election. One of the most public examples took place during the final television debate between presidential candidates on 12 June. During the debate, Ricardo Anaya, of the National Action Party, revealed that its website was making public some documents that criticised leading candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. While the debate was under way, the site was hit by a sustained cyber-attack and was knocked offline for hours.  Other interference included hashtag poisoning on Twitter. This, said Mr Trewinnard, involves a campaign flooding Twitter with posts related to a trending tag that supports a rival.""That triggers Twitter's spam filters which kills the hashtag from the trending feed,"" said Mr Trewinnard.Some attacks were much less sophisticated. One claimed to reveal that a candidate was not born in Mexico but failed to change the basic data on the birth certificate image which was copied, making the target more than 100 years old.Verificado brought together 90 separate organisations including major media groups, universities and civil organisations to find, investigate and debunk election-related material, said Mr Trewinnard. The media groups investigated disinformation and published rejoinders if it was found to be fake. It published hundreds of separate items which were shared millions of time and often helped dilute the impact of the fakes. It was clear, he said, that there was an appetite in Mexico for verified news sources. It is less clear whether Verificado worked, said Mr Trewinnard, but as the project ended there were loud calls from across the political spectrum for it to continue because the problem of fake news in Mexico has not gone away with the election of Mr Obrador.But what has become obvious is why so many groups are keen to indulge in such large-scale disinformation campaigns, said Toby Abel, from AI firm Krzana which helped Verificado scour sources for news.There was a lot of information to check, said Mr Abel, and though some of it was ""laughable nonsense"" there were still good reasons for putting it online and trying to get it widely shared. The reason, he said, was to poison debate generally and undermine people's faith in anything and everything they saw. ""The insidious danger of mass amounts of fake news is that we don't know what to believe,"" he said. ""I don't think we have yet got to a point where we know how to handle this.""  "
2018-09-10,Room on top?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180910234303/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45445912,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Labour Party is changing - with an influx of new members demanding more of a say over policy and election candidates, and agitating to remove some MPs. What is going on?In a Rotherhithe theatre hall that looks like the perfect setting for Shakespeare, Labour members gather to discuss plans to make it easier for local parties to remove their MPs. It's a meeting that's part of a ""democracy roadshow"" organised by the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting MP Chris Williamson. But talk of this tour being about plots to oust disloyal MPs is much ado about nothing, according to the Derby North MP. ""It's not a hatefest, it's a lovefest,"" Chris Williamson tells the 60 or so people who've come to hear him. Mr Williamson has been holding meetings like this one across the country all summer while the debate in Labour around the selection rules for Westminster MPs has been gaining traction.Thirteen Labour Party branches are now trying to get the issue of how MPs are selected on to the agenda at the Labour conference in Liverpool later this month.Some are calling for Labour MPs to be subject to mandatory open contests. The Jeremy Corbyn-supporting group Momentum also changed its official position earlier this week in favour of an open selection process. In the theatre hall at Rotherhithe's Sands Films Studio, almost every hand goes up when Mr Williamson asks people who support mandatory re-selection for MPs to raise their hands for a selfie. But then this is an audience made up of left-wingers - some Labour, some not - who have travelled here on a weekday evening to listen to him speak about the subject, so he's probably preaching to the converted.Among them is Pascale Mitchell, a former Liberal Democrat who joined Labour in 2013. She helped to organise the event, and invited me along to watch. She says trying to change the rules on selection isn't about getting rid of MPs who do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn. ""It means that the MPs will actually work to be more useful for the local people and the communities, because they're under a bit more scrutiny. ""I don't think it's a mechanism to get rid of MPs, I think it's a mechanism to make MPs better.""Her local Labour MP disagrees. Neil Coyle was elected in Bermondsey and Old Southwark in 2015 -pushing out Lib Dem Simon Hughes, who had held the seat for 32 years. Mr Coyle meets me in a neighbourhood in Bermondsey where knife crime claimed the life of a young man this summer. He says what voters here ""want to see is a Labour party focused on the struggle they face, on getting crime addressed"".""This is something the government's getting away with and that's something people should hear more from the Labour Party on,"" he says. ""Instead, we're spending hour after hour, day after day, week after week on internal issues that are irrelevant - by and large - not just to the majority of Labour members, but to the vast majority of voters.""Mr Coyle has been a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party. He believes that is why his constituency is one of the stops on Chris Williamson's tour - which he says is all about targeting MPs who aren't cheerleaders for the Labour leader.""This is only coming from those who think that they need more Corbyn clones in Parliament to do better,"" says Mr Coyle. ""Actually I disagree. If this system had been in place in the past who knows, Blair and New Labour could have used it to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn as an MP. ""It's a very dangerous precedent to suggest that any leader should be able to dictate who their MPs are.""The MP said there was ""already a process, the trigger ballot system, which is where members' branches and affiliates can trigger an open selection instead of the automatic retention of their sitting MP"".Under current Labour rules, sitting MPs who wish to stand for re-election are subject to a so-called ""trigger ballot"" process. If more than half of the branches and affiliates in the local constituency vote ""yes"" the MP is reselected. If they vote ""no"", then the process is put to an open selection in which other candidates can stand against the sitting MP.Chairing this democracy roadshow meeting in south London is Councillor Jack Buck. He joined Labour in 2014, is a member of Momentum and was elected to Southwark Council at the local elections in May this year.He tells me the current system is not fit for purpose.""I think that the selection procedures at the moment create quite a negative atmosphere.  ""The way in which the trigger ballot system works within the party that's been introduced creates this kind of environment of hostility, whereby anybody who wants to see thriving democratic process in the party has to vote against somebody instead of for something.""I think what Labour party members want is politicians of all stripes putting positive visions forward that they can really get behind and create an atmosphere that's policy-driven.""Policy is another key issue on the agenda at this meeting.Chris Bright, who's a member of Camberwell and Peckham CLP and the Southwark Momentum group, re-joined Labour in 2015 on the day Jeremy Corbyn became its leader, after having left the party in the 1980s.He tells me Labour needs to change to meet the needs of the more than half a million-strong membership who want more of a say in its policy direction.  ""Members generally feel that they don't have enough input into policy-making. ""We've got a much bigger membership now than in the past and those people want to get engaged in decisions about the direction of the party, national policy, local policy and we feel that the Labour party should be responsive to that and give ordinary members more of an input.""Labour's Democracy Review has been looking at how the grassroots could have a greater say in party matters, and was discussed by the party's ruling body - the National Executive Committee - this week. But de-selection hasn't been included in the review. Speaking to me in Rotherhithe, Chris Williamson said that was why local Labour branches across the country are making their own submissions to get the subject on the agenda at conference.""The mandatory re-selection is not actually part of the terms of reference of the democracy review.""There are a few motions that have been forwarded by constituency parties. ""The one that I'm backing and I hope that will get support is the one that's been put forward by Labour International, which is calling for open selections so that sitting MPs are subject to an endorsement process between three years and four years into their term of office.""If the motion does make it onto the conference agenda in Liverpool and enough Labour members vote for it, it could end up becoming party policy."

The government's proposed pilot scheme would allow the recruitment of up to 2,500 workers on six-month visas between the spring of 2019 and December 2020. The National Farmers Union (NFU) said the government's announcement was a ""major victory"" after two years of evidence that ""a shortage of workers has been hampering food production"". But British Summer Fruits - the industry body representing companies that supply fresh berries in UK supermarkets - says it's not enough. According to British Summer Fruits, farms are already reporting staff shortages of between 10% and 20%.The NFU estimates that 60,000 seasonal workers are employed in UK horticulture every year. If that's right, then 10% to 20% would imply a range of between 6,000 and 12,000 workers per year, although other estimates believe the figure is higher. What is clear is that the overwhelming majority of those workers had - in previous years - come from Central and Eastern Europe.  The NFU says roughly 67% have come from Romania and Bulgaria, 23% from eight other Central and Eastern European countries in the EU, and just 1% from the UK itself. Fewer seasonal workers have been coming to the UK from Central and Eastern Europe since the Brexit referendum, partly because of the decline in the value of the pound, which makes the amount paid to EU workers worth less when they return home and convert it into euros.It is also partly because other EU countries such as Germany are making greater efforts to attract seasonal workers. There is also the argument - which is more difficult to quantify - that EU workers feel less welcome than they did before. Whatever the precise reasons, the vast majority of fruit growers are worried that shortages of seasonal workers are going to get worse. There has already been an impact.In 2017, the NFU says, wages increased by an average of 9% compared with 2016. But the shortages were still there and there was no sign of more local workers signing up for the work. There has been plenty of anecdotal information about fruit left rotting in the fields - but it's hard to get any overall figures for the amount of fruit that may have been left on the plants across the UK.There are some clues out there, though.Angus Growers - based in Arbroath on the east coast of Scotland - says it was unable to pick 83.5 tonnes of soft fruit with an estimated value of Â£416,000 last year, because of a shortage of labour. Overall, it says, the total shortage of work days (the number of people multiplied by the number of days work missed) was 7,944. British Summer Fruits estimates that Angus Growers represents about 10% of the UK berry production.It is only one example but other companies tell similar stories. And the concern is that future growth in the sector is under threat. The government's proposed pilot scheme represents ""a 4% increase in a shrinking workforce"", says Nick Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits. ""The UK berry industry grows by at least 8% per annum and this [the government's plan] will not sustain a standstill, let alone growth."" Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs suggest those fears have not yet been realised. They say there was production of Â£541m of soft fruit in 2017, up from Â£495m in 2016. In the same period, orchard fruit rose from Â£205m to Â£224m.But labour shortages are certainly beginning to bite. The last time the UK had a seasonal agricultural worker scheme in 2013, 21,250 workers were allowed into the UK from Bulgaria and Romania before they gained full EU rights to freedom of movement.And many people in the industry believe similar numbers will be needed in the future. The government has suggested that it is willing to listen. ""We will review the pilot's results,"" said the Environment Secretary Michael Gove, ""as we look at how best to support the longer-term needs of industry outside the EU.""What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-09-10,The Brexiteers' alternative?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180910234303/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45423791,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAs Westminster is settling down to the next phase of its collective mild nervous breakdown, the pushback to Brexiteers' criticism of Theresa May's Chequers plan is that the naysayers don't have their own. It's not that far off from saying 'come and have a go if you think you're hard enough'!Or, in more polite terms, the kind that your parents might have advised, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. Those in government are deeply frustrated that they get knocked about by criticism from Brexiteers (and not just Boris Johnson, honest) who are right now engaged in an overt plan to kill off the prime minister's plan, based on months of work,  but are yet to front up with their own proposal. In the coming days, the Brexiteers, organised behind the scenes by that powerful grouping, the ERG, which regular readers here will be very familiar with, have a plan to counter that accusation.I hear from Sunday onwards we should expect several days of carefully planned announcements, almost like a government grid perhaps, where the Brexiteers, with their eyes ruthlessly on their short term prize of ""chucking Chequers"", will lay out an alternative. A roll out of written papers will begin over the weekend, with a big event expected in Westminster on Monday which, if it comes off, would just by chance coincide with Boris Johnson's next newspaper column. Plans, which are in this very febrile environment subject to a whole lot of change, are right now for a push on Sunday to make the argument for a free trade agreement, rather than Chequers.On Monday, we should see an explanation of the Brexiteers' vision for money and migration, and then on Wednesday for solutions to be presented for the crucial Northern Irish border question and other issues like agriculture and fishing. The idea is not, sources say crucially, to put pressure directly on Theresa May to trigger some kind of putsch. But don't be in any doubt, it is a carefully worked-through plan designed to present alternatives to what the government has put on the table, calculated to force the prime minister to ditch the policy. Of course, by publishing their own plans, the Brexiteers' will submit themselves to the same kind of scrutiny that the government itself has. It is one thing, they are well aware, to be merely critics, quite another to commit to alternatives that it's likely Number 10 will waste little time in tearing down. The emerging consensus among Brexiteers seems to be that it is better to present an alternative that will be open to criticism, than face the charge of having no worked out ideas of their own. The idea, when ministers say to MPs 'well it's Chequers or nothing', is their solution can fill in that blank. And to try, notably, to make Theresa May perform a huge U-turn before the Tory conference and admit, whether privately, tacitly, or publicly, that the July settlement simply can't stand.Those involved in designing the ""chuck Chequers"" plan are careful to point out that they would absolutely support the prime minister in shifting position. The condition being, if she does their bidding, they won't seek to damage her further. The political truth is too that while many Brexiteers would be ruthless in trying to achieve their political goal, their aim right now, and this goes for Boris Johnson too, is that the target is changing the policy, not changing the Tory party's leader. Yet for those in government right now, there is no question whatsoever of ditching the Chequers deal. Remember it's only the basis for a negotiation, and it took the government two years (yes two years) to come to that position. And insiders say for all the claims of Chequers being dead, in fact it will to a large extent be part of the eventual deal. In other words, remember, remember, remember Chequers was always a document from which a negotiation would finally start, and inside government there is still a strong belief that elements of it will survive. There's an acknowledgement inside government too that the next few weeks will be extremely testing. But right now, there is not even a sniff that they would be able, even if willing, to give one inch to the Brexiteers. But they are organised, determined and willing to try to force her to move, and might have more in their armoury if the prime minister sticks to her ground.  "

2018-09-10,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180910234303/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to Â£40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-10,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180910234303/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

Mr Johnson and other Conservative MPs opposed to Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU are facing growing pressure to provide an alternative plan.Speaking after the launch of the Economists For Free Trade report, which was attended by Mr Johnson and other senior Tories, leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said the European Research Group of Tory MPs he chairs would spell out its solution to the issue of avoiding a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland at a meeting on Wednesday. By the BBC's political correspondent Chris MasonIn Committee Room 9, the glitterati of the Brexiteer establishment. This was a gig with two key messages: banishing the bogeyman, as they see it, of WTO rules; they can be embraced, not fled from. Oh, and the government's Chequers plan is terrible.Boris Johnson and David Davis were both there, and recipients of applause for being willing to leave the cabinet on principle.Other stalwarts of the Eurosceptic army joined the crowd: Bill Cash, Iain Duncan Smith, and from the business world, Richard Tice and John Mills.This was not about sticking two fingers up to the EU. Plenty in the room argued that leaving the EU on WTO terms next March would be fine, but preferred reaching a withdrawal agreement, and securing a transition period.During this tranisition a looser long term relationship could be negotiated with Brussels, which they want to be a souped-up version of the free trade agreement between Canada and the EU.The UK is set to quit the single market and customs union but Mrs May wants British manufacturers to continue to have full access to European markets for their goods through a free trade zone - which would see the UK sign up to a common rule book.The so-called Chequers plan is unpopular with many Tory MPs, who argue it would compromise the UK's sovereignty, and Economists For Free Trade said the evidence showed it was not necessary to enjoy preferential market status to trade successfully with the EU.In the past 25 years, it said the UK had been ""heavily outperformed"" by countries outside the single market trading with the EU on WTO rules, such as the United States, India and China. During that period, it said the aggregate export growth of WTO countries had been four times larger than the growth of UK exports into the single market.At the same time, it said British exports to the rest of the world had grown more than three times faster than to the EU.The group of economists said it was wrong to characterise leaving the EU without a trade agreement in place as ""crashing out"" without a deal, because the UK and the European Commission would have a duty to reach a series of individual agreements in areas such as aviation and energy.""Switching to a world trade deal under WTO rules is no step in the dark because the UK already conducts about half its trade under WTO rules,"" the report said.""We have nothing to fear from trading on WTO terms. Let Brexit mean Brexit and let us flourish under the auspices of the WTO.""Outside the EU, the report argues, the UK would be free to set its own tariffs on EU imports and if these were eliminated, it could reduce prices for consumers by as much as 8%. with those on low incomes benefiting the most from cheaper food and clothing.On the other hand, it said if the EU chose to impose import tariffs on popular items, its large trade surplus with the UK could result in an annual boost to the UK Exchequer of as much as Â£13bn.Overall, it said trading with the EU on WTO rules could boost the UK's public finances by Â£80bn over the next 15 years, allowing future governments to raise spending and cut taxes. The campaign group, led by Professor Patrick Minford, is urging the UK to leave the EU before starting talks over a trade deal modelled on the EU's accord with Canada - arguing this would give the UK more leverage.""There would be no time constraints, the EU would have new, non-politically inspired, negotiating guidelines, and the benefits of a clean Brexit would be coming apparent,"" it said.Responding to the report, Labour's Chuka Umunna, a leading member of the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the final deal, said a no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK.""The latest Project Fantasy document from advocates of an ultra-hard Brexit promises to take us to a land of milk-and-honey,"" he said.""The reality is that, before we have even left, Brexit is forcing up prices in the shops, destabilising our economy and stripping our health service of the doctors and nurses that it so badly needs."""
2018-09-11,Reality Check: A 'clean-break' Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180911235935/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45488124,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA group of Tory MPs have endorsed a plan for a ""clean break"" from the European Union (EU), with the UK defaulting to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules when it leaves the EU. The proposals are contained in a report by the pressure group Economists for Free Trade (EFT). Here's an initial look at a few of the claims they've made. These figures are based on a number of calculations and assumptions, not all of which stand up to scrutiny. Those who have modelled a clean Brexit properly, the EFT asserts, report long-term gains from free trade of 2%-4% of GDP. The report dismisses alternative modelling - done by the Treasury and by Whitehall's Cross Departmental Brexit Analysis - which arrived at very different conclusions. But that is part of the problem. The EFT are convinced that they are the only people who have modelled the data correctly - even though theirs is a minority view.""The vast majority of economists think it will be different,"" says Prof Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex.""Because a hard Brexit will cut trade with the EU, which is by far our largest trading partner, significantly.""Chequers plan 'worse than status quo'What is the 'no deal' WTO option?Last year the UK exported almost Â£274bn in goods and services to the EU, compared with Â£112bn to the US. When it comes to imports, the UK imported Â£341bn in goods and services from the EU and Â£70bn from the US.  For those who love the detail, here is one example of economists who criticise the EFT's methodology. Tory supporters of Brexit are, however, unbowed: ""Perhaps it's our fault,"" says leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, ""by not putting the argument for a world trade deal earlier, we left the running to people who don't want us to leave the EU at all.""The EFT report also says the UK would no longer have to pay a net amount of Â£12bn to the EU every year, although that figure appears to be slightly inflated.According to the Treasury net payments to the EU amounted to Â£9.6bn in 2016 and Â£8.9bn in 2017. Forecasts over the next five years suggest that - if the UK were to stay in the EU - net payments to the EU would rise to roughly Â£11bn a year.The EFT report goes on to  suggests that the UK could choose to withhold ""most or all"" of the estimated Â£39bn financial settlement that the government has provisionally agreed to pay the EU as part of a Withdrawal Agreement. In theory, the UK could do that, but it would probably prompt a legal challenge from the EU, and it would certainly damage relations severely at a time when - as the EFT report suggests - the government would be looking for co-operation in a whole series of policy areas. It says only 4% of goods arriving in the UK from non-EU countries are subject to checks, and it suggests that trade with the EU in future could therefore be almost as seamless as it is now.  It's correct that very few physical or documentary checks are carried out on non-EU goods. But evidence given to the Home Affairs Select Committee suggests that things are rather more complicated than that. If a lorry arrives at Dover, for example, from a non-EU country, it is usually delayed by 60 to 90 minutes even if no checks are made. The UK could choose to speed up that process and abolish many checks, but there would still be far more checks on UK goods being exported to the EU via Dover. There would also be further complications for UK exports. Once the UK is designated as a third country by the EU, all UK exports of animal origin would only be able to enter EU territory via a veterinary border inspection post, where there are often time-consuming physical inspections as well as documentary checks. Neither the Eurotunnel nor the Calais port is currently designated as a veterinary border inspection post. The EFT report says that under WTO rules sanitary and phytosanitary measures (ie safety checks on food) can't be used as a ""surreptitious means of inhibiting cross-border trade"". This is true, but that does not erase what are known as non-tariff-barriers entirely, it simply reduces inspections where possible. ""The only countries that have managed to remove the need for health checks on food being exported to the EU,"" says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform, ""are the European Economic Area members and Switzerland. They have not only implemented EU rules in this area domestically, they also apply EU checks on all imports of animal origin entering from the rest of the world."" The EFT report also suggests lifting tariffs (or import charges) on imported goods to make prices cheaper. It recognises that if you do that for one country, you have to do it for every country, under WTO rules. If tariffs were removed for all agricultural produce, cheap imports would flood in and food prices would fall - but the UK farming industry could be decimated. So, the report says, that ""perhaps the most attractive goods to target"" might be ones that we don't produce in the UK at all. It mentions oranges as one example, but it would be a pretty limited number of goods.  Again, others are extremely sceptical about the EFT's policy proposals. According to a report published earlier this year by the House of Lords European Union Committee, ""EU food imports cannot easily be replaced by either producing more in the UK or importing more from non-EU countries"". The Lords report forecast that food prices were likely to rise without a Brexit deal. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-09-11,Labour pledges 'gig economy' rights boost,https://web.archive.org//web/20180911235935/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45479544,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour would extend workers' rights and ""restore the balance of power in the workplace"", shadow chancellor John McDonnell is to pledge.He will promise more rights for people working in the so-called gig economy.In his speech to the Trades Union Congress in Manchester, Mr McDonnell will say a ""new workplace environment"" will boost productivity.The Tories said unemployment is at an all-time low with millions of low-paid workers given a pay rise.In the gig economy, instead of a regular wage, workers get paid for the ""gigs"" they do, such as a food delivery or a car journey. A government report published in February found about 2.8 million people had worked in that capacity in the previous year, most commonly 18-34 year olds in the London area. Supporters say many workers like the flexible hours and short-term contracts on offer but Mr McDonnell will say they have contributed to ""a workplace environment of insecurity not seen since the 1930s"". Under a future Labour government, he will say workers in the gig economy could be given similar rights to those in permanent work, including eligibility for sick pay, maternity pay and similar benefits.His other proposals include allowing collective bargaining across different sectors of the economy and introducing employee ownership funds - under which staff at larger companies would be given shares in order to give them a stake in the profits and management of firms.""Labour's programme of workplace reform will restore the balance between employer and worker with a significant extension of trade union rights, modernising corporate governance structures and extending the opportunity for employees to share collectively in the benefits of ownership of their company,"" he will say.""Labour's common sense approach will forge a new workplace environment best suited to meeting the challenges of Britain's ongoing low productivity and the emerging fourth industrial revolution.""The decline of collective bargaining has meant that workers also now have little say over the key decisions taken by their employers over the future of their companies.""In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today, Mr McDonnell said there was a huge group of people who were doing multiple jobs and still only ""just about surviving"" because of low wages. He dismissed claims that extending union rights and employee ownership could destroy jobs - arguing they were needed to stop exploitation and create a civilised society.""If we want people treated fairly at work, we should have equal rights and from day one,"" he said.The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the Labour leadership believe the sort of radical polices being outlined would appeal to a much wider swathe of voters ahead of a general election which they believe could be only months away in the event of a disorderly Brexit.But Chancellor Philip Hammond hit back, saying: ""This is Labour's record on workers - the last Labour government left over half a million more people out of work, and every Labour government leaving office with unemployment higher than when it started.""The Institute of Directors, said employee ownership already existed as a business model, with tax incentives on offer to firms to encourage greater worker participation. ""Labour's proposal seems to cross the line between encouragement and coercion,"" the business group said. ""Different company structures have different pros and cons, and directors are best placed to decide what is in their organisation's best long-term interests."""

But a hard Brexit will cost Jaguar Land Rover more than Â£1.2bn a year - it's horrifying, wiping our profit, destroying investment in the autonomous, zero-emissions, we want to share.""He said that if poor UK productivity worsened after Brexit, he would be forced to move manufacturing to somewhere such as Poland, where it was cheaper to make cars.About a quarter of a million people in the UK rely directly, or indirectly, on the success of his company, Mr Speth said.He also criticised policymakers for putting in place more regulations and higher taxes on all diesel vehicles, when he said that newer diesel cars produced by JLR were as green as petrol vehicles.Mrs May's official spokesman said the government's Brexit plan would protect industries that depend on swift import and export of products.""The Chequers plan includes specific proposals to protect jobs within industries like the car industry that depend on just-in-time supply chains.""The common rule book would help ensure frictionless trade with the EU and would see our car sector continue to flourish,"" he added.The spokesman said the government had been ""engaged with the automotive industry throughout this process...

Mr Carney said he was ""willing to do whatever I can in order to promote both a successful Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank of England"".It is the second extension of his tenure as governor. When Mr Carney took over from Mervyn King in 2013, he agreed a five-year term with the option of a further three.The typical term for the position has been eight years.In October 2016, Mr Carney said he would staying on for an extra year, until June 2019, after his initial five-year term ended in 2018.Mr Hammond told the Commons that the early part of summer 2019 ""could be quite a turbulent period for our economy"" following the UK's scheduled departure from the EU on 29 March.Mr Carney had agreed ""despite various personal pressures"" to stay on until January 2020 to ""help support continuity in our economy during this period"", the chancellor said. The extension will give the government more time to recruit his successor, amid concern that few candidates would want to take on the role during an unpredictable stage in the Brexit process.Sir Jon Cunliffe, Bank of England deputy governor with responsibility for financial stability, has also been re-appointed for a second five-year term that will last until October 2023.Bradley Fried, chair of the Bank's Court of Directors, welcomed their decisions to stay on: ""Continuity in the outstanding leadership they provide will help the Bank succeed in our crucial work.""Nicky Morgan, chair of the Commons Treasury Committee, said the announcement provided ""much-needed stability and clarity"". ""The government should now use the extra seven months to continue its succession planning. It should identify a candidate in good time for the Treasury Committee to scrutinise the appointment,"" she added.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell welcomed the move. ""I have a good working relationship with Mark Carney. We meet on a regular basis and I have a lot of confidence in him, so I'm pleased this will give us a bit of stability."" The Canadian was the first non-Briton to be appointed governor in the Bank's 300-year history and had previously run the Bank of Canada for five and a half years from February 2008.In March 2008, just a month after his appointment, Mr Carney cut Canadian interest rates amid the financial crisis. That move, along with other measures, was considered to have boosted investor confidence, enabling Canada to recover more quickly than some other countries.He had a commercial banking background, as well as experience in the public sector - unlike his two most recent predecessors who had spent their careers within the Bank of England and academia.Mr Carney worked for investment banking giant Goldman Sachs in New York before returning home to work for Canada's Department of Finance.Born in March 1965 in Fort Smith in Canada's Northwest Territories, he graduated from Harvard University in 1988 and then earned a doctorate in economics at Oxford University in 1995.That year he married economist Diana Fox, whom he met at Oxford, and the couple now have four children."

""Come join the Brexit club, you'll love it,"" he said.Eurosceptic Mr Orban was re-elected earlier this year after campaigning on an anti-immigration platform, with Fidesz winning two-thirds of parliamentary seats.But while he has support at home, critics in the European Parliament say his policies are evidence he does not respect the values of the EU.A committee of MEPs points to the Hungarian government's approach to migration - including a new law which criminalises lawyers and activists who help asylum seekers - as well as media, the courts and universities as proof.However, in order for any sort of disciplinary proceedings to go ahead, it needs the backing of two-thirds of MEPs - and it is not clear which way the vote, due to take place on Wednesday, will fall.If MEPs do decide to support the process, which could end up with Hungary being monitored by Brussels, it may be a very slow process.The European Commission took the unprecedented step against Poland in December 2017, giving it three months to address concerns that its judicial reforms threatened the rule of law.However, there is still very little sign that a conclusion is coming, BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming says."

This adds to the perception that they are not welcome here."" But Lord Green, chairman of Migration Watch UK, welcomed an ""excellent report"".He said the committee's ""endorsement of the inclusion of students in the migration statistics should put this issue to bed"". James Pitman, speaking for the Destination for Education coalition of businesses involved in teaching overseas students, warned: ""Maintaining the status quo will do nothing to restore Britain's leadership in education exports. Our international competitors will continue to outperform us.""Gordon Marsden, Labour's shadow higher education minister, said he was ""extremely disappointed"" that the committee had not recommended removing students from migration targets, ""despite overwhelming evidence in favour"".Head of business, environment and skills at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""It's time to scrap the caps and arbitrary numerical targets. It's one thing to control migration, but quite another to use arbitrary mechanisms that deny businesses, universities and the public sector employers the people they need to address immediate skills gap."""
2018-09-11,Wages rise faster than expected,https://web.archive.org//web/20180911235935/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45481485,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWages saw faster than expected growth in the three months to July, as they continued to outstrip rising prices. Excluding bonuses, wages grew by 2.9%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), well above the inflation rate.Earnings have now outstripped inflation for four months. Unemployment continued to fall, dropping by 55,000 to 1.36 million, with the jobless rate remaining at 4%, its lowest level for over 40 years. The number of people in work was unchanged at 32.4 million. The ONS said the labour market was ""robust"" with the number of people in work ""still at historically high levels"".""With the number of people in work little changed, employment growth has weakened,"" said the ONS's head of labour market statistics, David Freeman.""Meanwhile, earnings have grown faster than prices for several months, especially looking at pay excluding bonuses.""The inflation rate for the three-month period to July was 2.4%, with the rate for just July slightly higher at 2.5%. Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Markets, said the figures indicated that ""competition for workers is finally starting to provide greater support to wages"". However, he does not expect the rosier picture for wages to prompt an interest rate rise from the Bank of England.""We still think that the MPC will hold off raising interest rates again until the near-term uncertainty due to the Brexit negotiations is resolved,"" he added. The Bank of England raised its key interest rate for only the second time in a decade last month. The current interest rate of 0.75% is the highest since March 2009.Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown said the latest employment figures showed that the Bank of England was right to raise rates last month.""The Bank looks at wage growth as a key driver of inflation. ""The problem is that if wages grow without corresponding productivity growth - as we've seen in the UK - it means more money chasing the same quantity of goods and services, which pushes up prices,"" he warned.Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editorYesterday economic growth hit 0.6%, the best number since July last year.Today, incomes are up 2.9%, a figure that has not been bettered since July 2015.With inflation for the month of July at 2.5%, real wage growth (which accounts for price rises) rose to 0.5% between May and July.High levels of employment could finally be passing through to our incomes as firms compete for our work.It will take a long time to repair the damage to incomes over the decade since the financial crisis.But with economic growth stronger and the possibility of some form of Brexit deal rising, this is certainly better news for the economy overall.Higher wages can feed through to higher levels of consumer spending. And consumer spending drives around two-thirds of what happens in the economy.The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Esther McVey, said: ""Since 2010 we have delivered significant growth in jobs, and in the last six months we've seen real-terms wage growth. ""We haven't had a lower unemployment rate for over 40 years and I'm especially proud that youth unemployment is at a record low, falling by over 45% since 2010 - opening up career opportunities for our next generation.""Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, said: ""Today's figures hide the real story of the labour market under this government: people are earning less than they did in 2008, and millions of workers are stuck in insecure jobs.""More families are working harder to get by, but the rising cost of living and low pay means that a job is no longer a reliable route out of poverty.""The ONS said job vacancies rose by 14,000 in the period to 833,000 - a record high. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said this was ""alarmingly high"" and ""further evidence of persistent skills shortages"". ""While the number of people in work stands close to historic highs, firms continue to report that attempting to recruit staff with the right skills is an increasingly uphill struggle, which is stifling their ability to grow and boost productivity,"" he added.Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said firms were now in heated competition for skills.""Vacancies are at an all-time high, and recruiters are finding it increasingly difficult to match available workers with job descriptions. ""In these circumstances, we would normally expect significant increases to salaries as firms attempt to attract the talent they need, but high costs and subdued productivity growth have impeded this somewhat,"" he added.Mr Parikh urged the chancellor to act in the forthcoming Autumn Budget to help provide reduce costs for businesses.

The department had not even forecasted the effect of losing 44,000 police officers and staff since 2010, the watchdog found. The report comes as Home Secretary Sajid Javid prepares for a speech to police superintendents in which he will say the police must be equipped for a changing landscape. On Monday, the leader of the superintendents' association warned the service was on the verge of a crisis. President @supersgav: there is a 'void' where the vision for police reform should be: https://t.co/oDDssC75KO #supers2018 pic.twitter.com/4Pf102sx2aEnd of Twitter post  by @policesupersPolice forces in England and Wales are funded through a Â£12.3bn combination of a central grant to each police and crime commissioner, as well as additional cash raised locally through the council tax and one-off grants for special projects. The NAO says the amount coming from the government is down 30% in real terms since 2010-11.""The Home Office has employed a light touch in its oversight of the 43 police forces in England and Wales and what that means is it does not really understand the nature of the demand facing those police forces,"" the NAO's Tom McDonald said. He said the funding formula used to allocate money is ""out of date"".""The Home Office told Parliament in 2015 that the formula was ineffective. Here we are, three years later, and there has not been an update and so it's unlikely that the money is going to the right places. We have real concerns about it.""Analyisis: By Dominic Casciani, Home Affairs CorrespondentThis report from the national spending watchdog paints a picture of a service on the front line of public protection under severe pressure - but nobody in government being entirely sure how much pressure it is really under. The assessors said that while no force was about to financially fail, the stress was apparent. Since two years ago, officers are taking four days longer to charge suspects - an indication of workload rather than rising crime - and there is less ""proactive work"", such as motorway stops of dangerous drivers, breathalyser tests and convictions for drug possession. The rolling national crime survey has charted rising dissatisfaction with the police - and many communities have campaigned against losing local cuts. Two cities - St Albans and Bath - no longer have a dedicated police station with a front desk. A Home Office plan to revise the police funding formula, to more fairly distribute funds, was mothballed following the March 2017 general election. The NAO said individual forces had been developing their own ways of predicting demand for their services but the Home Office itself had ""no overarching strategy for policing"". But a Home Office spokesman disputed some of the NAO's findings - saying it had ""a strategic direction"" and last year conducted a substantial review of police pressures. ""Our decision to empower locally accountable police and crime commissioners to make decisions using their local expertise does not mean that we do not understand the demands on police forces,"" said the spokesman. ""The report does not recognise the strengths of PCCs and chief constables leading on day-to-day policing matters, including on financial sustainability.""We remain committed to working closely with police and delivered a Â£460m increase in overall police funding in 2018/19, including increased funding for local policing through council tax,"" the spokesman said."

Ministers are being urged to change their policy and ""make deliberate trespass a criminal offence"".Tory MP Mark Francois said this would give police ""a real deterrent power"" to move travellers from land they do not own or have permission to be on.A spokesman for the traveller community said criminalisation was ""unhelpful"".""The government should focus on supporting local authorities to build more authorised sites and stopping places - and to allow gypsies and travellers who want sites on their own land equitable access to the planning system,"" said Jim Davies from The Traveller Movement.Mr Davies told the BBC that recent research conducted by the charity revealed that 91% of the traveller community ""experienced discrimination"".He called on the government to promote equality.""Criminalising stopping is unhelpful and will only aggravate issues experienced by gypsies, Roma and Irish travellers whilst ensuring even poorer relations with the rest of society,"" he said.Leading the debate on gypsies and travellers in the Commons on Monday, former Tory minister Andrew Selous said the ""time for endless, constant reviews is over"".The government is currently preparing its formal response to a consultation on the law around unauthorised caravan sites and developments.But Mr Selous said people who were seeing ""atrocious living conditions in their areas, which often become ungoverned space where modern slavery and other crime flourishes, want action now"".My name is Debbie Saunders. I am a Romany gypsy. I have lived in a trailer (caravan) all my life. My family and myself have travelled through England for many years, but now, sadly, it seems the people who run our government and the people I call my countrymen want this stopped.The doors of England are open to every culture, every colour and every creed - that is, unless you are a gypsy or traveller, then you are not welcome.I'm faced with hatred and racism every day of my life - and then I get told it's not racist because gypsies aren't a race.Should I be looked at with mistrust because of what I am? Should my children have to accept it as well?  Why should I have to change my life, my culture, my heritage to conform with the ideals of the non-travellers?The Conservative MP for South West Bedfordshire said there had been 116 unauthorised traveller camps in Central Bedfordshire last year.Clear-up costs were around Â£350,000, he said, with 250 tonnes of litter cleared from one encampment.He said current policy was failing both traveller and settled communities. ""The whole situation is a complete disgrace in the United Kingdom in 2018, and government ministers and officials responsible for this policy area should be hanging their heads in shame,"" Mr Selous added.The government said the majority of the traveller community were law-abiding.Mr Selous and Mr Francois were among those arguing for the government to emulate Ireland, which in 2002 made deliberate trespass a criminal offence. The knock-on effect of this change has been that more travellers have arrived in England from Ireland, as ""we are regarded as something of a soft touch"", Mr Francois added.A change in the law would give police greater power to move travellers on.""If they did not do so, they could be arrested, and their vehicles could be impounded - which, believe you me, would be a very powerful deterrent to the travelling community.""In response, communities minister Kit Malthouse told MPs the communities secretary had recently met the Irish government to discuss their approach."

In the last 10 PMQs, Corbyn has chosen to address Brexit with 42 out of a possible 60 questions - exactly 70% of the time. Of the 14 that weren't about Brexit, six were about buses and another eight were about the NHS, although two of these followed on from a line of questioning about Theresa May's promise to pour a supposed ""Brexit dividend"" back into healthcare.Of course, there are different ways of classifying his questions - a question can be about more than one subject - but by my reckoning this has made Brexit the most common theme of Mr Corbyn's questions since he became leader.Despite this, Mr Corbyn has been criticised in the past for skirting the issue, when he has the opportunity to put the government on the spot. In total, since the EU referendum on 23 June 2016, he has asked 105 questions about Brexit. That equates to just over 27% of all the questions he has asked in that time. But they haven't come in one steady stream. Between 25 January and 22 November 2017, Mr Corbyn only referred to Brexit in one question, and that - on 25 October - was to list the lack of no-deal planning alongside a number of other examples of alleged government incompetence. The prime minister had no trouble evading the issue in her response.Mr Corbyn did respond to statements made to the House by the prime minister after key EU summits and after PMQs on 29 March 2017, the day Article 50 was triggered. But PMQs is an opportunity for the leader of the opposition to take the initiative and to drive the debate. Over those 10 months, he chose instead to speak about public sector pay cuts, the sweetheart deal for Surrey Council, Theresa May holding Donald Trump's hand, changes to National Insurance for the self-employed, zero hours contracts, universal credit, tax avoidance, school places, Grenfell Tower and the NHS.It was left to Emily Thornberry to probe the government on Brexit when she deputised for Mr Corbyn on 12 July 2017. The shadow foreign secretary grilled then deputy prime minister Damian Green with six straight questions about the government's no-deal planning.The picture has gradually changed since. As Labour has shifted towards a softer position on Brexit, Mr Corbyn has begun to ramp up the pressure in PMQs. There was a clutch of 12 questions at the end of 2017 and another dozen at the end of February, before he turned the heat up from May.Critics might complain about Mr Corbyn's execution, but they can no longer say that he is not talking about Brexit. All of which goes to prove the old adage: you wait for one Brexit question and then 42 come along all at once."
2018-09-11,Keep calm and carry on,https://web.archive.org//web/20180911235935/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45479549,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBefore 'keep calm and carry on' was a phrase that appeared on cushions, mugs, fridge magnets, and memes, it was a useful phrase to describe a particularly British attitude demonstrated by unflashy politicians who ignored (or should we say tried to ignore) colleagues who were looking for limelight, concentrated on what they were trying to get done and went back for more when times got rough.And, if you can forget the over-use of what was a wartime propaganda phrase, it is still an instruction that is useful to characterise much of the prime minister's attitude. Indeed, when she's chosen a more dramatic tack it sometimes has not exactly gone well. Calling the election in 2017, her biggest strategic mistake, was an entirely unnecessary drama.And as the real crunch period for Brexit approaches, KCACO (surely there's a Whitehall acronym for this somewhere) is firmly the prime minister's approach.And despite the disagreements in the Tory party being ventilated every moment, Theresa May has, in public at least, little intention of overreacting - if reacting at all.The new heat of the Tory despair and disagreements is because we are now, at last you might say, nearing at least the beginning of the end of the Brexit process.There is less than a school term to go before the overall political deal is meant to be done. The stakes therefore are huge. And when times are anxious, the smallest thing can cause outrage or ecstasy.So in this kind of political atmosphere, every word, every warning, every stray comment, every indiscretion can send people screaming to slam the panic button.Inside government the plan is to keep going, take the knocks, carry on, however strong the resistance is, and to make a more determined effort to try to persuade people of the merits of their proposal.There is frustration inside government that the prime minister hasn't made more effort to expound the benefits of the Chequers approach. She did, after all, make chunky speeches on previous occasions when there were big developments in the government's thinking. Not this time.But in the frenetic run-up to the Tory conference, government ministers will be despatched around the country to at least try to get Tory Party members on side.But the calculation inside government is, as it has been throughout this very bumpy road, that in the end, there will be a Brexit deal and that a majority of MPs will be too alarmed at the prospect of no deal with the EU, which would mean no two year period of getting used to it, to do more than flirt with the notion of voting it down.In the end therefore, the government's assumption is that a deal would go through because of old-fashioned common sense.Here's the thing - politics is not always governed by common sense. People are also motivated by conviction, by ideology, by identity, by emotion, and a different kind of common sense.To many Tories in government it is common sense to try to stay as close to the EU as possible to try to minimise disruption. To many others, that's simply the wrong way to look at Brexit.And those Conservatives who want looser ties are very serious about what they are trying to do which is no less than force her to change tack.Theresa May is trying very hard to KCACO.  She's showing no sign of budging - perhaps her deal will acquire a sense of inevitability. But despite warmer words from Brussels, at home with no majority Theresa May won't have the luxury of ignoring her critics forever."

The leadership of the rail union, the RMT, oppose a new vote. On the other side, there is a vanguard pushing for a referendum on the final Brussels deal no matter what.  This includes the GMB and the smaller Community and TSSA unions.So away from public view the shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer spent his Sunday in what are, these days, smoke-free rooms sounding out what the big unions will do in two weeks' time at Labour's conference.His mission is to try to find consensus and avoid conflict before all eyes turn to the Conservative conference a week later.So he wanted to find out if the largest union backing a 'people's vote' - the GMB - would press for Labour to adopt the same policy.I understand he was told they will.Currently the Labour leadership insist they would prefer to call for an election if Parliament either rejects Theresa May's final deal, or if she returns from Brussels empty-handed.A referendum, though, wouldn't be off the table as an option.Not just some unions, but many rank-and-file Labour members want their leadership to go further.So I'm told Sir Keir is trying to find ""a form of words"" to paper over any underlying differences before the party gathers in Liverpool.And Frances O'Grady's language at the TUC conference could provide the blueprint.In words and phrases that could only really be written by a committee, the TUC - including the big Labour supporting unions Unison and Unite - will formally agree a motion on the conference floor today backing ""the possibility of a campaign for people to have a final say on the final Brexit deal through a popular vote"".But more robustly, the TUC's general secretary adds that if this were to happen, then unions' ""full weight"" would be behind that campaign.And it is felt that if the Labour leadership could sound more enthusiastic about the prospect - rather than appearing to be being dragged reluctantly towards it - that might just be enough to keep the Remainers in Labour's ranks from publicly revolting.Unite's Len McCluskey - whose position is close to Jeremy Corbyn's - is stressing a new vote should be left ""on the table"".For Kremlinologists, that's more positive than the previous formulation of ""not taking it off the table"".But one thing is clear - the Labour leadership won't agree to back a new vote in all circumstances.If their language does become more positive, caveats will remain - and any support for a new referendum would only be triggered if Parliament can't agree a deal with Brussels."

ASI was called in because of its success in making tools to automatically spot videos made by the Islamic State group being spread on social media.Those well-produced ""official"" videos were key to the radicalisation of many people who carried out ""lone wolf"" attacks in London and other cities, said Mr Gibson.""There are particular classes of video that cause the real damage,"" he said. ""They are slick and well-produced. ""The quality of the content matters because you can start to persuade people that are sceptical. These are so troubling because they are so visceral.""As the Deep Fake technology improves, it might be used to generate the convincing clips that can significantly damage debate and undermine legitimate elections.Big web platforms such as Facebook and YouTube did a lot of their own work to find and flush out IS propaganda, said Mr Gibson, but smaller firms need help to scrutinise the huge amount of video flowing online. The same will be true of Deep Fakes. Systems based around machine learning and AI can do the job of finding content and processing video far faster than humans can, he said.Research suggests that the IS videos appeared online via more than 400 different platforms, said Mr Gibson. The Deep Fakes are likely to be uploaded through at least as many routes.""If you are spreading fake news it does not matter to you where it is, it's not like you get more status if it's on YouTube,"" he said. ""You just want people to look at it.""As long as it is on the open web and as long as you can cut and paste a link to it in a message the job is basically done,"" he told the BBC.There have already been efforts to combat election interference, most particularly during Mexico's recent presidential election.""Mexico has a long history of social network manipulation that goes way back,"" said Tom Trewinnard, director of programmes at media firm Meedan which helped to run a project to combat fake news and disinformation in the country called Verificado.The electronic disruption intensified during the 2018 election. One of the most public examples took place during the final television debate between presidential candidates on 12 June. During the debate, Ricardo Anaya, of the National Action Party, revealed that its website was making public some documents that criticised leading candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. While the debate was under way, the site was hit by a sustained cyber-attack and was knocked offline for hours.  Other interference included hashtag poisoning on Twitter. This, said Mr Trewinnard, involves a campaign flooding Twitter with posts related to a trending tag that supports a rival.""That triggers Twitter's spam filters which kills the hashtag from the trending feed,"" said Mr Trewinnard.Some attacks were much less sophisticated. One claimed to reveal that a candidate was not born in Mexico but failed to change the basic data on the birth certificate image which was copied, making the target more than 100 years old.Verificado brought together 90 separate organisations including major media groups, universities and civil organisations to find, investigate and debunk election-related material, said Mr Trewinnard. The media groups investigated disinformation and published rejoinders if it was found to be fake. It published hundreds of separate items which were shared millions of time and often helped dilute the impact of the fakes. It was clear, he said, that there was an appetite in Mexico for verified news sources. It is less clear whether Verificado worked, said Mr Trewinnard, but as the project ended there were loud calls from across the political spectrum for it to continue because the problem of fake news in Mexico has not gone away with the election of Mr Obrador.But what has become obvious is why so many groups are keen to indulge in such large-scale disinformation campaigns, said Toby Abel, from AI firm Krzana which helped Verificado scour sources for news.There was a lot of information to check, said Mr Abel, and though some of it was ""laughable nonsense"" there were still good reasons for putting it online and trying to get it widely shared. The reason, he said, was to poison debate generally and undermine people's faith in anything and everything they saw. ""The insidious danger of mass amounts of fake news is that we don't know what to believe,"" he said. ""I don't think we have yet got to a point where we know how to handle this.""  "
2018-09-11,Room on top?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180911235935/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45445912,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Labour Party is changing - with an influx of new members demanding more of a say over policy and election candidates, and agitating to remove some MPs. What is going on?In a Rotherhithe theatre hall that looks like the perfect setting for Shakespeare, Labour members gather to discuss plans to make it easier for local parties to remove their MPs. It's a meeting that's part of a ""democracy roadshow"" organised by the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting MP Chris Williamson. But talk of this tour being about plots to oust disloyal MPs is much ado about nothing, according to the Derby North MP. ""It's not a hatefest, it's a lovefest,"" Chris Williamson tells the 60 or so people who've come to hear him. Mr Williamson has been holding meetings like this one across the country all summer while the debate in Labour around the selection rules for Westminster MPs has been gaining traction.Thirteen Labour Party branches are now trying to get the issue of how MPs are selected on to the agenda at the Labour conference in Liverpool later this month.Some are calling for Labour MPs to be subject to mandatory open contests. The Jeremy Corbyn-supporting group Momentum also changed its official position earlier this week in favour of an open selection process. In the theatre hall at Rotherhithe's Sands Films Studio, almost every hand goes up when Mr Williamson asks people who support mandatory re-selection for MPs to raise their hands for a selfie. But then this is an audience made up of left-wingers - some Labour, some not - who have travelled here on a weekday evening to listen to him speak about the subject, so he's probably preaching to the converted.Among them is Pascale Mitchell, a former Liberal Democrat who joined Labour in 2013. She helped to organise the event, and invited me along to watch. She says trying to change the rules on selection isn't about getting rid of MPs who do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn. ""It means that the MPs will actually work to be more useful for the local people and the communities, because they're under a bit more scrutiny. ""I don't think it's a mechanism to get rid of MPs, I think it's a mechanism to make MPs better.""Her local Labour MP disagrees. Neil Coyle was elected in Bermondsey and Old Southwark in 2015 -pushing out Lib Dem Simon Hughes, who had held the seat for 32 years. Mr Coyle meets me in a neighbourhood in Bermondsey where knife crime claimed the life of a young man this summer. He says what voters here ""want to see is a Labour party focused on the struggle they face, on getting crime addressed"".""This is something the government's getting away with and that's something people should hear more from the Labour Party on,"" he says. ""Instead, we're spending hour after hour, day after day, week after week on internal issues that are irrelevant - by and large - not just to the majority of Labour members, but to the vast majority of voters.""Mr Coyle has been a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party. He believes that is why his constituency is one of the stops on Chris Williamson's tour - which he says is all about targeting MPs who aren't cheerleaders for the Labour leader.""This is only coming from those who think that they need more Corbyn clones in Parliament to do better,"" says Mr Coyle. ""Actually I disagree. If this system had been in place in the past who knows, Blair and New Labour could have used it to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn as an MP. ""It's a very dangerous precedent to suggest that any leader should be able to dictate who their MPs are.""The MP said there was ""already a process, the trigger ballot system, which is where members' branches and affiliates can trigger an open selection instead of the automatic retention of their sitting MP"".Under current Labour rules, sitting MPs who wish to stand for re-election are subject to a so-called ""trigger ballot"" process. If more than half of the branches and affiliates in the local constituency vote ""yes"" the MP is reselected. If they vote ""no"", then the process is put to an open selection in which other candidates can stand against the sitting MP.Chairing this democracy roadshow meeting in south London is Councillor Jack Buck. He joined Labour in 2014, is a member of Momentum and was elected to Southwark Council at the local elections in May this year.He tells me the current system is not fit for purpose.""I think that the selection procedures at the moment create quite a negative atmosphere.  ""The way in which the trigger ballot system works within the party that's been introduced creates this kind of environment of hostility, whereby anybody who wants to see thriving democratic process in the party has to vote against somebody instead of for something.""I think what Labour party members want is politicians of all stripes putting positive visions forward that they can really get behind and create an atmosphere that's policy-driven.""Policy is another key issue on the agenda at this meeting.Chris Bright, who's a member of Camberwell and Peckham CLP and the Southwark Momentum group, re-joined Labour in 2015 on the day Jeremy Corbyn became its leader, after having left the party in the 1980s.He tells me Labour needs to change to meet the needs of the more than half a million-strong membership who want more of a say in its policy direction.  ""Members generally feel that they don't have enough input into policy-making. ""We've got a much bigger membership now than in the past and those people want to get engaged in decisions about the direction of the party, national policy, local policy and we feel that the Labour party should be responsive to that and give ordinary members more of an input.""Labour's Democracy Review has been looking at how the grassroots could have a greater say in party matters, and was discussed by the party's ruling body - the National Executive Committee - this week. But de-selection hasn't been included in the review. Speaking to me in Rotherhithe, Chris Williamson said that was why local Labour branches across the country are making their own submissions to get the subject on the agenda at conference.""The mandatory re-selection is not actually part of the terms of reference of the democracy review.""There are a few motions that have been forwarded by constituency parties. ""The one that I'm backing and I hope that will get support is the one that's been put forward by Labour International, which is calling for open selections so that sitting MPs are subject to an endorsement process between three years and four years into their term of office.""If the motion does make it onto the conference agenda in Liverpool and enough Labour members vote for it, it could end up becoming party policy."

The government's proposed pilot scheme would allow the recruitment of up to 2,500 workers on six-month visas between the spring of 2019 and December 2020. The National Farmers Union (NFU) said the government's announcement was a ""major victory"" after two years of evidence that ""a shortage of workers has been hampering food production"". But British Summer Fruits - the industry body representing companies that supply fresh berries in UK supermarkets - says it's not enough. According to British Summer Fruits, farms are already reporting staff shortages of between 10% and 20%.The NFU estimates that 60,000 seasonal workers are employed in UK horticulture every year. If that's right, then 10% to 20% would imply a range of between 6,000 and 12,000 workers per year, although other estimates believe the figure is higher. What is clear is that the overwhelming majority of those workers had - in previous years - come from Central and Eastern Europe.  The NFU says roughly 67% have come from Romania and Bulgaria, 23% from eight other Central and Eastern European countries in the EU, and just 1% from the UK itself. Fewer seasonal workers have been coming to the UK from Central and Eastern Europe since the Brexit referendum, partly because of the decline in the value of the pound, which makes the amount paid to EU workers worth less when they return home and convert it into euros.It is also partly because other EU countries such as Germany are making greater efforts to attract seasonal workers. There is also the argument - which is more difficult to quantify - that EU workers feel less welcome than they did before. Whatever the precise reasons, the vast majority of fruit growers are worried that shortages of seasonal workers are going to get worse. There has already been an impact.In 2017, the NFU says, wages increased by an average of 9% compared with 2016. But the shortages were still there and there was no sign of more local workers signing up for the work. There has been plenty of anecdotal information about fruit left rotting in the fields - but it's hard to get any overall figures for the amount of fruit that may have been left on the plants across the UK.There are some clues out there, though.Angus Growers - based in Arbroath on the east coast of Scotland - says it was unable to pick 83.5 tonnes of soft fruit with an estimated value of Â£416,000 last year, because of a shortage of labour. Overall, it says, the total shortage of work days (the number of people multiplied by the number of days work missed) was 7,944. British Summer Fruits estimates that Angus Growers represents about 10% of the UK berry production.It is only one example but other companies tell similar stories. And the concern is that future growth in the sector is under threat. The government's proposed pilot scheme represents ""a 4% increase in a shrinking workforce"", says Nick Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits. ""The UK berry industry grows by at least 8% per annum and this [the government's plan] will not sustain a standstill, let alone growth."" Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs suggest those fears have not yet been realised. They say there was production of Â£541m of soft fruit in 2017, up from Â£495m in 2016. In the same period, orchard fruit rose from Â£205m to Â£224m.But labour shortages are certainly beginning to bite. The last time the UK had a seasonal agricultural worker scheme in 2013, 21,250 workers were allowed into the UK from Bulgaria and Romania before they gained full EU rights to freedom of movement.And many people in the industry believe similar numbers will be needed in the future. The government has suggested that it is willing to listen. ""We will review the pilot's results,"" said the Environment Secretary Michael Gove, ""as we look at how best to support the longer-term needs of industry outside the EU.""What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-09-11,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180911235935/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to Â£40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-11,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180911235935/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Here's what happened.Passions were running high in the Commons at the final Prime Minister's Questions before the party conference season gets under way.But Jeremy Corbyn began in a low-key way, with a riddle designed to knock Theresa May off balance.What did the National Farmers' Union, the Federation of Small Businesses, the National Audit Office, the National Housing Federation, Gingerbread and the Royal Society of Arts all have in common, he asked.  A grinning Mrs May was momentarily flummoxed, perhaps thinking he was trying to lay a Brexit trap for her.They were all organisations that ""give excellent service"" to the areas they represent, replied the PM, and to which the government listened.They were all organisations, said Mr Corbyn, that were telling the government that its flagship welfare reform, Universal Credit, was ""flawed"" and failing thousands of families. The government had promised in 2010 to lift 350,000 children out of poverty - did she stand by that figure, he asked.Mrs May ran through the purpose of Universal Credit, to make work pay and simplify the benefit system, without answering the question. The Child Poverty Action Group has said Universal Credit will increase the number of children in poverty by half a million, said Mr Corbyn, who was sporting two ears of wheat on his lapel, in honour of Back British Farming Day (Mrs May who once, naughtily, wrecked a field of wheat had, perhaps wisely, opted not to join him). The prime minister reached for her notes and - sounding a bit like Mr Corbyn when he reads out letters at PMQs - quoted some of Universal Credit's alleged satisfied customers, such as ""Roberta"" whose work coach had ""found me my dream job"". She then hailed the latest unemployment figures.âWe are helping get people into workâ - PM hits back after Jeremy Corbyn says âUniversal credit will now increase the number of children in povertyâ https://t.co/QUP3a2ywxi #PMQs pic.twitter.com/chah2K9XljEnd of Twitter post  by @BBCPoliticsAll MPs were aware of the ""pain"" Universal Credit was causing from people at their advice surgeries, said Mr Corbyn. Did she agree with the National Audit Office that it would create hardship, force more people to use food banks and ""could end up costing the system even more"".Mrs May said she remembered from years back a constituent, a single mother, who had been told by the job centre that she would be ""better off on benefits"". That was the last Labour government's legacy, she told him.The Labour leader accused the government of putting vulnerable people at risk with its benefit changes, something immediately denied by the PM.It was Labour that was ""speaking up for the poorest in this country"", shouted a visibly angry Mr Corbyn amid a growing wall of noise from MPs on all sides.  ""The government's Brexit negotiations are an abject failure - I can see that by the sullen faces behind her, and that's not just the ERG group it's the whole lot of them,"" he cried.  ""The prime minister is not challenging the burning injustices in our society. She is pouring petrol on them. When will she stop inflicting misery on the people of this country?""""The prime minister is not challenging the burning injustices in our society"" Jeremy Corbyn says Theresa May references Chuka Umunna's claim that Labour is ""institutionally racist""https://t.co/QUP3a2ywxi #PMQs pic.twitter.com/UYIlO8X1wZEnd of Twitter post 2 by @BBCPoliticsMrs May launched into a full-throated defence of her own record on ""burning injustice"" such as the government's ""racial disparity audit"" and a crackdown on stop and search (""that was me as home secretary"").Then, knowing that Mr Corbyn would not get a comeback, she laid into Labour's recent internal troubles, ending with a quote from Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who had claimed his party was ""institutionally racist"". This left Conservative MPs baying loudly for ""more"".The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, called on the PM to ""end her austerity programme or admit that her party is unfit to govern"".Conservative MP Chris Philp asked the prime minister about the planned exit payment of Â£39bn from the UK to the EU on Brexit, and whether it was ""locked unto the legally binding withdrawal agreement"".Trudy Harrison, one of several MPs wearing wheat badges at PMQs to mark British Farming Day, asked about the export of meat after Brexit. Theresa May said Brexit meant the UK could leave the Common Agricultural Policy and develop its own policy.Tory MP Sir Hugo Swire asked why the Windrush report into immigration issue had not been released, despite him raising it two months ago.Labour MP Justin Madders raised fracking, and teased the prime minister, who has a ""number of statements on her website"" calling for planning decisions to made locally rather than nationally.Conservative MP John Lamont who asked whether ""Parliamentarians, both current and former"" should appear on Russian state TV, Mrs May said they risked being used as ""propaganda tools"" by Russia, but it was a ""matter of judgement"" for each person.Here is BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg's take on the session:""By the end of their exchanges, Theresa May looked absolutely furious, just as Jeremy Corbyn had done in his last question to her"" @bbclaurak on #pmqs#politicslive https://t.co/qOzgoqYVDb pic.twitter.com/vJqqZgBivEEnd of Twitter post 3 by @BBCPoliticsBBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy's verdict:Well that was nasty. Shouty, a bit more personal and very, very loud. This finger-jabbing, heckle-heavy PMQs demonstrated the rising political temperature in Parliament. Pre-prepared attack lines were deployed and the respective parties howled their delight, but no-one was trounced, or even bruised in the encounters between the main players. It was telling that, either from herd instinct or conscious organisation, there was quite an effort to provide the PM with helpful questions which allowed her to pivot to good news stories. One way or another loyalist Tories are coming to their leader's assistance. Maybe the hyper-partisan atmosphere deterred any MPs from the various rebel factions on the Tory and Labour benches from breaking ranks.  The most telling moment came when former Army officer Jonny Mercer raised the continuing historic investigations into military veterans over allegations dating from the Iraq war or the Northern Ireland troubles. Mr Mercer has irritated Downing Street with his continuing parliamentary campaign on this issue, and on veterans' mental health, which stretch back to his maiden speech in 2015 - and here he was again with a critical question to the PM. Her answer using terms like ""flawed"" and ""disproportionate"" seemed to hint at a softening of the government's position, and Mr Mercer's frown in response suggests he will be following up to pin down exactly what she might mean."
2018-09-12,Technology 'key to Irish border solution',https://web.archive.org//web/20180913014940/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45495960,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA hard border on the island of Ireland can be avoided by using ""established"" technology and ""modifying"" existing arrangements, Brexiteer Tory MPs say.The European Research Group said the issue had been allowed to ""frame"" the talks but need not block a trade deal.They urged ""effective co-operation"" between Belfast and Dublin to address smuggling concerns and extra customs forms to be processed via VAT returns. The EU has insisted on a ""backstop"" to ensure the single market is protected. Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a return to physical checks at the Northern Ireland border, but have yet to agree how this can be achieved.Downing Street said it had looked at the border issue for nearly two years and the prime minister's Chequers blueprint - which envisages a free trade zone for goods moving between the UK and the EU backed up by a ""facilitated customs arrangement"" - was the ""only credible and negotiable option"". The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the ERG's answer to the problem of the Irish border seemed to be that ""there isn't really a problem"". He said the group was citing the example of the ""invisible border"" between Norway and Sweden as a precedent for how post-Brexit arrangements might work. Speaking at the launch of the ERG's report in London, former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Patterson said he and other MPs were trying to ""help the European Union and the UK government"" by ""giving an answer"" to a problem which has risked derailing the Brexit process. He insisted there was ""absolutely nothing new"" in what the group was proposing because the solutions already exist to deliver ""an ordered border"". He said there was already a tax, VAT, excise and currency border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland which was maintained by ""administrative and technical tools"".Please upgrade your browserRead the full glossary here This should continue after Brexit, he said, supplemented by a range of mechanisms to ensure customs checks are conducted away from the border, such as trusted trader schemes.""We absolutely believe there is no need for new physical infrastructure at the border and it can be handled by current means,"" he said. The report acknowledges a range of new checks will be needed on goods passing across the 310 mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit, including extra customs declarations and declarations of origin as well as sanitary, phytosanitary and product compliance procedures. Among the proposals put forward in the document to deal with these are:The report concluded: ""The proposals can be realised within the existing legal and operational frameworks of the UK and EU, based on the mutual trust on which regular trade depends.""They do nothing to alter the constitutional position of Northern Ireland and do not violate the principle of consent of the enshrined in the Belfast Agreement.""Are Tory MPs set to move against Theresa May?There is massive frustration with her leadership, her position on Chequers and the way her proposals tuck the UK closely into the EU in perpetuity. And yes, there are some MPs who want to see her gone immediately. However senior voices in the European Research Group - yes them - are adamant that it is not the time to try to oust the PM. It would be ""stupid"", one told me last night. Imagine in these critical weeks of the Brexit negotiations if the UK started to try to change the prime minister. Right now those jostling to remove her know they don't have any guarantees they would have the numbers to force her out, even though they may well be able to pull together enough MPs to submit letters to the chair of 1922 committee to trigger a contest.John Campbell, the BBC's Northern Ireland business and economics editor, said the document offered more detail than before and put forward a number of ""plausible technocratic solutions"".But he said they placed a lot of store on the EU agreeing to mutual recognition of standards and the UK having access to its VAT system - which was far from clear. The Democratic Unionist Party, whose support Theresa May relies on for her majority in Westminster, said the proposals were ""positive and timely"" and the issue should not be an impediment to a wider Brexit deal. Speaking before the proposals were published, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK could not ""walk away"" from its responsibilities to uphold the Good Friday Agreement.""It is not the European Union, it is Brexit that risks making the border more visible in Northern Ireland,"" he said.The CBI said the proposals were ""superficial"", while Labour MP Alison McGovern, who backs the People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said neither the government nor her Tory critics had ""any answers"" to the question.""The Good Friday Agreement committed the UK to guaranteeing there would be no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of the people there,"" she said.""Imposing additional border checks - whether they at the frontier, two miles or 20 miles from it - has no democratic legitimacy.""Tory MPs opposed to Theresa May's Chequers blueprint have denied plotting against her, after it emerged the issue of her future was discussed openly by Tory MPs at a meeting on Tuesday night.""We've got a very good prime minister,"" former Brexit Secretary David Davis said. ""I disagree with her on one issue, it's this issue. She should stay in place because we need stability, and we need decent government as the backdrop for what we're doing in the coming next six months."""

Eurosceptic MPs are to unveil what they say is a solution to the Irish border.Environment Secretary Michael Gove said leadership speculation was ""loose talk"" and urged MPs to unite behind the PM.Mr Gove said he wanted Mrs May to stay in Downing Street ""as long as possible"" and believed her much-criticised Chequers blueprint for future relations with the EU could win the support of Parliament.Leadership speculation was ""like the weather...feature of British life"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today.""This is loose talk. There is always loose talk. The critical thing is we deliver on the Brexit mandate and any diversion or distraction from that commitment means our ability to ensure that it delivered is undermined.""Please upgrade your browserRead the full glossary here The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the significance of the ideas discussed at the ERG meeting would have to be considered as leading Tory Brexiteers - Jacob Rees-Mogg, Owen Paterson, Iain Duncan Smith, Bernard Jenkin, David Davis, Boris Johnson - were not present.Mrs May says she wants to strike a trade deal with the EU for after the UK leaves in 2019. She also says there needs to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland, in order to avoid a hard border there. The ERG strongly opposes these proposals, which form part of what has become known as the Chequers plan. One MP present at the meeting on Tuesday evening said the group considered ""possible scenarios over the Autumn"" depending on the deal the prime minister did or didn't get with the EU, BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake said.Comments at Tuesday evening's meeting were said to include ""everyone I know says she has to go"", ""she's a disaster"" and ""this can't go on"".We voted in 2016 â why is it taking so long to leave?Well, none of the major players has ever left the European Union before...So there are some BIG problems to solveSuch as how we donât end up worse-off economicallyThe EU has a ""single market"" - goods from other EU countries aren't taxed at the borderAnd people can also move around as if the EU was a single countryOutside the EU, the UK might have to pay more to buy from and sell to EU countriesThis could also slow the flow of goods and parts, disrupting production for UK firmsThe EU says Britain canât cherry pick â keeping some benefits without membershipBut that could mean the UK is freer to make other trade deals around the worldAny special deal the UK wants has to be approved by MPs firstThen the deal has to be agreed by 27 national parliaments across EuropeThatâs a lot of people who need to agree with each otherâ¦So, the date UK is meant to leave is 29 March 2019But there are already plans for a 21-month transition period after thatDuring which the UK could still be governed by some EU lawsA trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to agreeHowever, as the UKâs already fully aligned with the EU, it could be quickerBut it is likely that we will all be talking about Brexit for a long time yet...Click next arrow to proceedLoading ...Swipe to progressIf you can't see the explainer, follow this linkOne source said ""people feel the leadership is out of touch and has lost the plot"", but another said changing the leader ""is a stupid idea now"". A number told the meeting in Westminster that they had already submitted letters of no confidence in Mrs May. However, it is understood they are not planning an immediate move against her.A Conservative leadership contest can be triggered either if the leader resigns or if 15% of Tory MPs (currently 48) write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, demanding a vote of no confidence.Are Tory MPs ready to move against May?By the BBC's political editor Laura KuenssbergThere is massive frustration with her leadership, her position on Chequers and the way her proposals tuck the UK closely into the EU in perpetuity. And yes, there are some MPs who want to see her gone immediately.However senior voices in the European Research Group are adamant that it is not the time to try to oust the PM.

The government's Chequers plan has not yet been accepted by the EU. Both sides have also agreed on the need for a ""backstop"" agreement to avoid new physical infrastructure on the border, irrespective of the final deal that is negotiated.Some Brexiteers have claimed the border issue is being ""exploited"" by the EU and Remain supporters to keep the UK closely tied to Brussels.Speaking at the launch of the ""clean-break"" proposals, attended by Tory Brexiteers on Tuesday, Mr Rees-Mogg said the border was the only thing standing in the way of the UK negotiating a free trade deal like the EU has with Canada.He added: ""It is possible to move very swiftly to a Canada-plus style deal as long as we can come up with a scheme, which I think we have got for tomorrow, on how do you ensure a solution to the Northern Ireland problem that any reasonable person would accept?"""

The UK and EU agreed in principle in December that the UK would pay about Â£39bn to cover outstanding financial obligations and future liabilities arising from its EU membership.Mrs May was asked by Chris Philp whether the payment was dependent on reaching an agreement on the UK's future relations with the EU that was ""satisfactory"" to MPs.He also urged the prime minister not to be ""locked into"" any financial agreement unless there were guarantees the UK would be free to work on new trade agreements during the proposed transition period ending in December 2020 and to sign them the moment it leaves. In response, Mrs May said the negotiations were being conducted on the basis that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"".""We are very clear we need to have a link between the future relationship and the withdrawal agreement.""Tory MPs have expressed concerns that the UK could find itself paying the money with no guarantees over its future trade relationship, Boris Johnson suggesting the UK has agreed to ""hand over Â£40bn of taxpayers' money for two-thirds of diddly squat"".

2018-09-12,Tom Watson 'reversed' type-2 diabetes,https://web.archive.org//web/20180913014940/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45495384,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour's deputy leader Tom Watson has revealed he was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes but has ""reversed"" the condition through diet and exercise.He has now come off medication after losing seven stone (44.5kg) since last summer.He cut out junk food, starchy carbohydrates and refined sugar and took up cycling and running.The MP has vowed to launch a crusade against diabetes if Labour wins power at the next election.""I feel great. I feel absolutely fantastic. Chilled out, I feel like my IQ has gone up. I feel younger. It's a great feeling,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.He has said he developed diabetes through being ""overweight, deeply unfit, [and] addicted to sugar and fast foods"".The West Bromwich MP - once nicknamed ""Tommy two dinners"" - told Today he had ""battled weight since my early 20s"".""I kept putting on pounds and then I was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes. Like a lot of middle-aged men, I immediately went into denial. My condition was so frightening, I didn't begin to understand it. I just pretended I didn't have it.""And then I hit 22 stone - and I have a young daughter. I kept reading biographies of Labour politicians who died in their 50s and I knew I had to sort it out"".After researching the subject, he started a diet by ""giving up sugar"" and cut out beer and curry. He then began to exercise, starting with walking then cycling, running, boxing and weight-training.About four million people in the UK have diabetes, with the condition accounting for 10% of all NHS spending.Poor diet and a lack of exercise mean it's possible a million more people in this country could be diagnosed with diabetes over the next 20 years, according to a report by Public Health England. The large majority of cases - 90% - are caused by type-2 diabetes, which is linked to obesity and poor health choices.The other 10% are type-1 diabetes, a disease of the immune system that has nothing to do with lifestyle choices and is neither preventable nor reversible.Type-2 diabetes is a chronic condition associated with obesity and family history and is more likely to be diagnosed in older people. It's more common than type-1 diabetes. It is caused by problems with controlling blood sugar levels - either because the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, or if a body's cells do not react to insulin as they should. The condition is treated by medication or controlling a person's diet.Diabetes UK offers advice on preventing and coping with type-2 diabetes.Mr Watson has vowed to set up an independent, cross-party commission to investigate ways of preventing the condition if Labour wins power, with the aim of eliminating the estimated rise in cases within five years.""I think a lot of people feel shame when they are diagnosed with it because you kind of know, you get warning signs,"" he told Today.""But for many millions of people, it's an entirely preventable and reversible condition"" with ""the right nutrition and exercise"".""It is a public health scandal that so many millions of people are having to suffer this condition when they don't have to,"" he added.According to a World Health Organization report, the UK is the third fattest among 53 countries in Europe, with heavy drinking a key cause.The United Nations body found 27.8% of adults in the UK are obese compared with 32.1% of people in Turkey and 28.9% in Malta. Those whose body mass index is at least 30 are deemed to be obese."

2018-09-12,Hammond: Financial crisis 'shock' continues,https://web.archive.org//web/20180913014940/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45502084,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe ""shock"" of the financial crisis continues to impact the economy and peoples' finances, UK chancellor Philip Hammond has said.Ten years after the financial system went into meltdown, he admitted ""people are still suffering the effects"".But he said, in an interview with BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed, there is ""light at the end of the tunnel"".Rising wages and falling inflation were good news, he said, but uncertainty about Brexit was an economic dampener.A decade ago this week, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed, sending shockwaves through the global financial system.Research carried out for the BBC to mark the occasion showed that wages remain substantially below what they would have been with the crisis.Mr Hammond told the BBC: ""We suffered a very big shock to our economy in 2008/09, and that's a shock from which people are still suffering the effects today.""He was ""acutely conscious"" of the impact on wage stagnation and living. But he added: ""We have got through this in much better shape than many of our neighbours.""We haven't suffered catastrophic rises of unemployment, on the contrary, we've seen employment grow by three million jobs over this period.""We didn't see widespread repossessions of homes, collapses of businesses, in the way we've done in previous recessions, so I think the way this has been managed has minimised the impact.""Independent analysis from the Office for Budget Responsibility projected real wage growth over the coming years, he added.Mr Hammond also defended government efforts to cut debt, which many people argue led to austerity and worsened the impact on peoples' incomes and the economy.""In the aftermath of the crisis, the urgent need was to reassure markets and investors about our intentions,"" Mr Hammond said. ""Government borrowing had grown to unprecedented levels - almost 10% of our total national income in the year after the crash - and the markets needed to know that we were going to be able to get that under control.""He had, in fact, relaxed fiscal rules when becoming chancellor in 2016, Mr Hammond pointed out. That gave ""more headroom"" he said. But the challenge the economy faces ""is not lack of demand, it's poor productivity. It we want to see sustainable rises in living standards and real wages, we have to address the productivity challenge,"" he said.An impediment to stronger economic growth was uncertainty about the outcome of negotiations to leave the European Union, the chancellor said.Brexit talks were currently ""acting as a dampener on the economy"".""The potential of a no-deal exit with high disruption as a consequence is clearly a risk to the financial system.""He repeated warnings about the impact on London's huge financial services sector from a non-deal Brexit. ""If that market is disrupted then there could be significant consequences."" Mr Hammond said he understood the calls for more spending on, say, the NHS and police. ""We've made a huge commitment to the NHS, committing to spending Â£24bn across the UK by the end of this five-year period,"" he told the BBC.But he added: ""We do have to get our debt down. We have to do that for two reasons: Firstly the cost of our debt, is crippling - Â£50bn a year of money that we could be spending on schools and hospitals and police forces, being paid out in interest on the debt.""Secondly, having a debt that is this high, 85% of our GDP, reduces our ability to respond to another shock to the economy, another recession."""

I will ensure that the relevant Home Office Minister updates my honourable friend on the outcome of those meetings,"" she said.A spokesman from the mayor's office said it was a ""tragic and deeply distressing matter"".He said the mayor was contacted about the case in August and has discussed it with the deputy mayor and the chief constable, and has written to Leah's family to offer his full support.""This is being treated with the upmost seriousness and the mayor and deputy mayor's firm focus continues to be supporting the family until they get the answers they need,"" he said.Greater Manchester Police has been approached for comment."
2018-09-12,Juncker plans big EU border guards boost,https://web.archive.org//web/20180913014940/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45492746,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe EU plans to send 10,000 more border guards to tackle unlawful immigration by 2020, the European Commission's president Jean-Claude Juncker said in his annual state of the union address. He called for more solidarity, rather than ""ad-hoc solutions"" for people on migrant ships.His speech also tackled the region's other burning issues - populism, terrorism and Brexit.This is Mr Juncker's last 12 months in the role.He also proposed a new Africa-Europe alliance, based on co-operation rather than charity, leading to a continent-to-continent free trade agreement.He recommended that the euro be used more strategically as the biggest currency after the dollar.And he called for strong leadership on Brexit. ""The United Kingdom will never be an ordinary third country for us,"" he said. The next elections to the European parliament are expected to be held in late May next year.Analysis by Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor This was Jean-Claude Juncker's final speech as European Commission president, a nod to his legacy. He was clearly keen to pat himself on the back where he could. His key message: Europe is going in the right direction (though we can't be complacent). But where was the passion? Public opinion polls across Europe show people more in favour of the EU than they have been in recent years but - and this is a hugely important but - they're also more sympathetic towards populist parties, which are often nationalist and Eurosceptic in nature. These parties tend to win favour among voters because their message is that they - unlike traditional parties, and unlike what they call remote technocrats in Brussels - are listening to people's concerns and care deeply about social issues. Populist parties are expected to do very well in next year's elections for the European Parliament. Mr Juncker said little today to change that by persuading disenchanted voters.In his speech, Jean Claude Juncker also made a notably controversial proposal to abolish EU member countries' vetoes on certain tax and foreign policy issues. This is likely to be pounced on by critics of the EU who accuse it of being an undemocratic institution. Mr Juncker said the EU needed to be secure from the many threats that faced it.""We will not militarise the European Union. What we want is to become more autonomous and live up to our global responsibilities,"" he said.""Only a strong and united Europe can protect our citizens against threats internal and external - from terrorism to climate change.""Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, currently employs 1,600 border guards across the EU, so the new figure is a substantial hike. Mr Juncker committed to further developing the European Asylum Agency to offer more support to member states processing asylum seekers.He stressed a need for legal routes for migration into Europe. ""We need skilled migrants,"" he said. From the start of Mr Juncker's mandate in 2014, migration has been a major crisis.It has sparked a rise in populism that has seen power shifts in Italy, Austria, Hungary and Poland, with Sweden the latest country to register a rise in anti-immigration votes in an election.On Wednesday morning, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told legislators in Berlin that illegal migration poses a greater threat to the cohesion of the European Union than the eurozone crisis.German parliament is debating its government response to far-right demonstrations in recent weeks. Mr Juncker offered some support to British Prime Minister Theresa May's Chequers plan, agreeing that the starting point for future partnership should be a free trade area between the EU and the UK. He also emphasised the union's support for Ireland. ""We want to find a creative solution that prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland. But we will equally be very outspoken should the British government walk away from its responsibilities under the Good Friday Agreement.""There will be ""new rules to get terrorist content off the web within one hour"". Internet platforms will be required to develop new methods to police content but it is unclear what form those would take.The written proposal states that net firms that fail to comply would face fines of up to 4% of their annual global turnover.He called it Europe's ""twin continent"" - a supportive nod to the African continent's attempts to build its own version of the EU. He said the new Alliance for Sustainable Investment and Jobs between Europe and Africa would help create up to 10 million jobs there in the next five years. ""We will create framework that brings more private investment to Africa,"" he said, adding the EU External Investment Plan - launched two years ago - had already started the work. BBC Africa correspondent Andrew Harding said Europe is increasingly emulating China's approach to Africa - focusing on trade and on partnerships rather than conflicts and charity. But Europe has some catching up to do, he added. ""We should embrace the kind of patriotism that is used for good, and never against others,"" he said. ""We should reject the kind of exaggerated nationalism that projects hate and destroys all in its path. The kind of nationalism that points the finger at others instead of searching for ways to better live together.""After the speech, the EU parliament voted to start disciplinary procedures against Hungary for breaching core democratic values. On Tuesday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he would not respond to ""blackmail"".The commission has already launched disciplinary proceedings against Poland over reforms it says challenge the rule of law.""Europe's economy has now grown for 21 consecutive quartersâ¦ Never have so many men and women - 239 million people - been in work in Europe,"" Mr Juncker said.""Youth unemployment is at 14.8%. This is still too high a figure but is the lowest it has been since the year 2000.""""Clock-changing must stop,"" the EU Commission president said, announcing an end to EU laws insisting countries change their clocks twice a year. ""Member States should themselves decide whether their citizens live in summer or winter time.""The next elections to the European parliament are expected to be held in late May next year."
2018-09-12,European Parliament backs copyright changes,https://web.archive.org//web/20180913014940/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45495550,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowControversial new copyright laws have been approved by members of the European Parliament.The legislation had been changed since July when the first version of the copyright directive was voted down. Critics say it remains problematic.Many musicians and creators claim the reforms are necessary to fairly compensate artists. But opponents fear that the plans could destroy user-generated content, memes and parodies.Leaders of the EU's member states still need to sign off on the rule changes before the individual countries have to draft local laws to put them into effect.The vote in Strasbourg was 438 in favour of the measures, 226 against and 39 abstentions.MEPs voted on a series of changes to the original directive, the most controversial parts are known as Article 13 and Article 11. Article 13 puts the onus on web giants to take measures to ensure that agreements with rights holders for the use of their work are working.Critics say that would require all internet platforms to filter content put online by users, which many believe would be an excessive restriction on free speech.Article 11 is also controversial because it forces online platforms to pay news organisations for the use of their content.MEPs settled for a version of the directive that compromised on some of the methods news organisations will be able to use to charge web companies for links to content.The final version clarifies that this will not include the sharing of hyperlinks to content such as news stories.It also watered down a proposal for upload filters to automatically delete content that violates copyright.EU commissioners Andrus Ansip and Mariya Gabriel, who proposed the reform, said it was ""an essential step to achieving our common objective of modernising the copyright rules in the European Union"".Phil Sherrell, head of media, entertainment and sports at law firm Bird & Bird said: ""Rights holders will be delighted as the directive provides them with additional rights and should strengthen their ability to negotiate royalty payments from online platforms that use their work.""But, he added: ""The devil remains in the detail; the next few months will see the EU Council get the directive into final form for it to be passed into law - potentially before Brexit - and there remain opportunities for those disappointed by today's vote to try to alter the drafting.""And Shireen Permohamed, a partner at law firm Harbottle and Lewis said fears that Article 13 would affect the sharing of parodies and net memes were unfounded.""Although we have not yet seen the agreed text, an EU spokesperson has confirmed that any action taken by online platforms must be designed so that it doesn't catch legitimate use of content, such as permitted quotations or parodies,"" she told the BBC.Earlier this week, YouTube'sIts chief business officer Robert Kyncl said that endorsement of Article 13 risked ""discouraging or even prohibiting platforms from hosting user-generated content"".Musician Wyclef Jean also spoke out against the directive, appealing to MEPs before the vote to ""embrace and improve the internet, rather than attempt to block and hinder it"".But many other musicians, including Sir Paul McCartney, had expressed their support for the changes. Impala, the association for European independent music companies, said after the vote that it was ""a great day for Europe's creators"".Julia Reda, an MEP who has fought the changes, tweeted her disappointment that the two most controversial parts of the directive had been approved by fellow parliamentarians.Final vote for Parliament position on the copyright directive with #UploadFilters and #LinkTax: adopted.

There is massive frustration with her leadership, her position on Chequers and the way her proposals tuck the UK closely into the EU in perpetuity. And yes, there are some MPs who want to see her gone immediately. However senior voices in the European Research Group - yes them - are adamant that it is not the time to try to oust the PM. It would be ""stupid"", one told me last night. Imagine in these critical weeks of the Brexit negotiations if the UK started to try to change the prime minister. Right now those jostling to remove her know they don't have any guarantees they would have the numbers to force her out, even though they may well be able to pull together enough MPs to submit letters to the chair of 1922 committee to trigger a contest.So are the Eurosceptics coldly gaming the options for how to get their way? Does that include discussing if, when and how, they could try to push the prime minister out of office? Absolutely. But does it mean we are on the verge of a coup being launched against Number 10? Things can change very fast these days. But don't be so sure."
2018-09-12,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180913014940/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45488124,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA group of Tory MPs has endorsed a plan for a ""clean break"" from the European Union (EU), with the UK defaulting to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules when it leaves the EU. The proposals are contained in a report by the pressure group Economists for Free Trade (EFT). Here's an initial look at a few of the claims they've made. These figures are based on a number of calculations and assumptions, not all of which stand up to scrutiny. Those who have modelled a clean Brexit properly, the EFT asserts, report long-term gains from free trade of 2%-4% of GDP. The report dismisses alternative modelling - done by the Treasury and by Whitehall's Cross Departmental Brexit Analysis - which arrived at very different conclusions. But that is part of the problem. The EFT are convinced that they are the only people who have modelled the data correctly - even though theirs is a minority view.""The vast majority of economists think it will be different,"" says Prof Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex.""Because a hard Brexit will cut trade with the EU, which is by far our largest trading partner, significantly.""Chequers plan 'worse than status quo'What is the 'no deal' WTO option?Last year the UK exported almost Â£274bn in goods and services to the EU, compared with Â£112bn to the US. When it comes to imports, the UK imported Â£341bn in goods and services from the EU and Â£70bn from the US.  For those who love the detail, here is one example of economists who criticise the EFT's methodology. Tory supporters of Brexit are, however, unbowed: ""Perhaps it's our fault,"" says leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, ""by not putting the argument for a world trade deal earlier, we left the running to people who don't want us to leave the EU at all.""The EFT report also says the UK would no longer have to pay a net amount of Â£12bn to the EU every year, although that figure appears to be slightly inflated.According to the Treasury net payments to the EU amounted to Â£9.6bn in 2016 and Â£8.9bn in 2017. Forecasts over the next five years suggest that - if the UK were to stay in the EU - net payments to the EU would rise to roughly Â£11bn a year.The EFT report goes on to  suggests that the UK could choose to withhold ""most or all"" of the estimated Â£39bn financial settlement that the government has provisionally agreed to pay the EU as part of a Withdrawal Agreement. In theory, the UK could do that, but it would probably prompt a legal challenge from the EU, and it would certainly damage relations severely at a time when - as the EFT report suggests - the government would be looking for co-operation in a whole series of policy areas. It says only 4% of goods arriving in the UK from non-EU countries are subject to checks, and it suggests that trade with the EU in future could therefore be almost as seamless as it is now.  It's correct that very few physical or documentary checks are carried out on non-EU goods. But evidence given to the Home Affairs Select Committee suggests that things are rather more complicated than that. If a lorry arrives at Dover, for example, from a non-EU country, it is usually delayed by 60 to 90 minutes even if no checks are made. The UK could choose to speed up that process and abolish many checks, but there would still be far more checks on UK goods being exported to the EU via Dover. There would also be further complications for UK exports. Once the UK is designated as a third country by the EU, all UK exports of animal origin would only be able to enter EU territory via a veterinary border inspection post, where there are often time-consuming physical inspections as well as documentary checks. Neither the Eurotunnel nor the Calais port is currently designated as a veterinary border inspection post. The EFT report says that under WTO rules sanitary and phytosanitary measures (ie safety checks on food) can't be used as a ""surreptitious means of inhibiting cross-border trade"". This is true, but that does not erase what are known as non-tariff-barriers entirely, it simply reduces inspections where possible. ""The only countries that have managed to remove the need for health checks on food being exported to the EU,"" says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform, ""are the European Economic Area members and Switzerland. They have not only implemented EU rules in this area domestically, they also apply EU checks on all imports of animal origin entering from the rest of the world."" The EFT report also suggests lifting tariffs (or import charges) on imported goods to make prices cheaper. It recognises that if you do that for one country, you have to do it for every country, under WTO rules. If tariffs were removed for all agricultural produce, cheap imports would flood in and food prices would fall - but the UK farming industry could be decimated. So, the report says, that ""perhaps the most attractive goods to target"" might be ones that we don't produce in the UK at all. It mentions oranges as one example, but it would be a pretty limited number of goods.  Again, others are extremely sceptical about the EFT's policy proposals. According to a report published earlier this year by the House of Lords European Union Committee, ""EU food imports cannot easily be replaced by either producing more in the UK or importing more from non-EU countries"". The Lords report forecast that food prices were likely to rise without a Brexit deal. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

In the last 10 PMQs, Corbyn has chosen to address Brexit with 42 out of a possible 60 questions - exactly 70% of the time. Of the 14 that weren't about Brexit, six were about buses and another eight were about the NHS, although two of these followed on from a line of questioning about Theresa May's promise to pour a supposed ""Brexit dividend"" back into healthcare.Of course, there are different ways of classifying his questions - a question can be about more than one subject - but by my reckoning this has made Brexit the most common theme of Mr Corbyn's questions since he became leader.Despite this, Mr Corbyn has been criticised in the past for skirting the issue, when he has the opportunity to put the government on the spot. In total, since the EU referendum on 23 June 2016, he has asked 105 questions about Brexit. That equates to just over 27% of all the questions he has asked in that time. But they haven't come in one steady stream. Between 25 January and 22 November 2017, Mr Corbyn only referred to Brexit in one question, and that - on 25 October - was to list the lack of no-deal planning alongside a number of other examples of alleged government incompetence. The prime minister had no trouble evading the issue in her response.Mr Corbyn did respond to statements made to the House by the prime minister after key EU summits and after PMQs on 29 March 2017, the day Article 50 was triggered. But PMQs is an opportunity for the leader of the opposition to take the initiative and to drive the debate. Over those 10 months, he chose instead to speak about public sector pay cuts, the sweetheart deal for Surrey Council, Theresa May holding Donald Trump's hand, changes to National Insurance for the self-employed, zero hours contracts, universal credit, tax avoidance, school places, Grenfell Tower and the NHS.It was left to Emily Thornberry to probe the government on Brexit when she deputised for Mr Corbyn on 12 July 2017. The shadow foreign secretary grilled then deputy prime minister Damian Green with six straight questions about the government's no-deal planning.The picture has gradually changed since. As Labour has shifted towards a softer position on Brexit, Mr Corbyn has begun to ramp up the pressure in PMQs. There was a clutch of 12 questions at the end of 2017 and another dozen at the end of February, before he turned the heat up from May.Critics might complain about Mr Corbyn's execution, but they can no longer say that he is not talking about Brexit. All of which goes to prove the old adage: you wait for one Brexit question and then 42 come along all at once."
2018-09-12,Keep calm and carry on,https://web.archive.org//web/20180913014940/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45479549,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBefore 'keep calm and carry on' was a phrase that appeared on cushions, mugs, fridge magnets, and memes, it was a useful phrase to describe a particularly British attitude demonstrated by unflashy politicians who ignored (or should we say tried to ignore) colleagues who were looking for limelight, concentrated on what they were trying to get done and went back for more when times got rough.And, if you can forget the over-use of what was a wartime propaganda phrase, it is still an instruction that is useful to characterise much of the prime minister's attitude. Indeed, when she's chosen a more dramatic tack it sometimes has not exactly gone well. Calling the election in 2017, her biggest strategic mistake, was an entirely unnecessary drama.And as the real crunch period for Brexit approaches, KCACO (surely there's a Whitehall acronym for this somewhere) is firmly the prime minister's approach.And despite the disagreements in the Tory party being ventilated every moment, Theresa May has, in public at least, little intention of overreacting - if reacting at all.The new heat of the Tory despair and disagreements is because we are now, at last you might say, nearing at least the beginning of the end of the Brexit process.There is less than a school term to go before the overall political deal is meant to be done. The stakes therefore are huge. And when times are anxious, the smallest thing can cause outrage or ecstasy.So in this kind of political atmosphere, every word, every warning, every stray comment, every indiscretion can send people screaming to slam the panic button.Inside government the plan is to keep going, take the knocks, carry on, however strong the resistance is, and to make a more determined effort to try to persuade people of the merits of their proposal.There is frustration inside government that the prime minister hasn't made more effort to expound the benefits of the Chequers approach. She did, after all, make chunky speeches on previous occasions when there were big developments in the government's thinking. Not this time.But in the frenetic run-up to the Tory conference, government ministers will be despatched around the country to at least try to get Tory Party members on side.But the calculation inside government is, as it has been throughout this very bumpy road, that in the end, there will be a Brexit deal and that a majority of MPs will be too alarmed at the prospect of no deal with the EU, which would mean no two year period of getting used to it, to do more than flirt with the notion of voting it down.In the end therefore, the government's assumption is that a deal would go through because of old-fashioned common sense.Here's the thing - politics is not always governed by common sense. People are also motivated by conviction, by ideology, by identity, by emotion, and a different kind of common sense.To many Tories in government it is common sense to try to stay as close to the EU as possible to try to minimise disruption. To many others, that's simply the wrong way to look at Brexit.And those Conservatives who want looser ties are very serious about what they are trying to do which is no less than force her to change tack.Theresa May is trying very hard to KCACO.  She's showing no sign of budging - perhaps her deal will acquire a sense of inevitability. But despite warmer words from Brussels, at home with no majority Theresa May won't have the luxury of ignoring her critics forever."

The leadership of the rail union, the RMT, oppose a new vote. On the other side, there is a vanguard pushing for a referendum on the final Brussels deal no matter what.  This includes the GMB and the smaller Community and TSSA unions.So away from public view the shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer spent his Sunday in what are, these days, smoke-free rooms sounding out what the big unions will do in two weeks' time at Labour's conference.His mission is to try to find consensus and avoid conflict before all eyes turn to the Conservative conference a week later.So he wanted to find out if the largest union backing a 'people's vote' - the GMB - would press for Labour to adopt the same policy.I understand he was told they will.Currently the Labour leadership insist they would prefer to call for an election if Parliament either rejects Theresa May's final deal, or if she returns from Brussels empty-handed.A referendum, though, wouldn't be off the table as an option.Not just some unions, but many rank-and-file Labour members want their leadership to go further.So I'm told Sir Keir is trying to find ""a form of words"" to paper over any underlying differences before the party gathers in Liverpool.And Frances O'Grady's language at the TUC conference could provide the blueprint.In words and phrases that could only really be written by a committee, the TUC - including the big Labour supporting unions Unison and Unite - will formally agree a motion on the conference floor today backing ""the possibility of a campaign for people to have a final say on the final Brexit deal through a popular vote"".But more robustly, the TUC's general secretary adds that if this were to happen, then unions' ""full weight"" would be behind that campaign.And it is felt that if the Labour leadership could sound more enthusiastic about the prospect - rather than appearing to be being dragged reluctantly towards it - that might just be enough to keep the Remainers in Labour's ranks from publicly revolting.Unite's Len McCluskey - whose position is close to Jeremy Corbyn's - is stressing a new vote should be left ""on the table"".For Kremlinologists, that's more positive than the previous formulation of ""not taking it off the table"".But one thing is clear - the Labour leadership won't agree to back a new vote in all circumstances.If their language does become more positive, caveats will remain - and any support for a new referendum would only be triggered if Parliament can't agree a deal with Brussels."
2018-09-12,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180913014940/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.3%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-12,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180913014940/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

On Wednesday it was announced that had been elected TUC president for the coming year.Labour has been dealing with a row about the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than two years.A 2016 inquiry, carried out by Shami Chakrabarti, concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism, there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". Earlier this month the party's ruling body agreed to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism.Mr Corbyn has apologised for hurt caused by anti-Semitism in the party and pledged to stamp it out.However some MPs have been critical of the leadership over what they say is its failure to get to grips with the problem.A spokesperson for the Public and Commercial Services Union said: ""Mark spoke at a Palestine Solidarity Campaign fringe event at the TUC - an organisation PCS is affiliated to.""He made the point at the start of the meeting, that we need to oppose anti-Semitism in society and within the Labour movement.""But we should not allow the issue of anti-Semitism to be used by people who are attempting to silence Palestinian voices as they legitimately struggle for their rights and a sovereign state."""
2018-09-13,Brexit: Carney makes property crash warning,https://web.archive.org//web/20180914024059/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45516678,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Bank of England's governor has warned the cabinet that a chaotic no-deal Brexit could crash house prices and send another financial shock through the economy.Mark Carney met senior ministers on Thursday to discuss the risks of a disorderly exit from the EU.His worst-case scenario was that house prices could fall as much as 35% over three years, a source told the BBC.The warning echoes some of the Bank's previous comments.The Bank of England routinely carries out ""stress tests"" to check whether the banking system can withstand extreme financial shocks.Its latest one was conducted in November, when it said a 33% fall in house prices could occur in a worst-case scenario. Several reports said that the Bank governor also told the Downing Street meeting that mortgage rates could spiral, the pound and inflation could fall, and countless homeowners could be left in negative equity.Speaking on Friday in Dublin, Mr Carney said the stress test was aimed at making sure the the largest UK banks could continue to meet the needs of the country through ""even through a disorderly Brexit, however unlikely that may be"".""Our job, after all, is not to hope for the best but to plan for the worst,"" he added. Mr Carney, who has just agreed to stay on as governor of the central bank until 2020, has faced strong criticism in the past, with Brexiteers accusing him of being part of the Remain camp.Kamal Ahmed, economics editorIt appears that the Governor wasn't providing the Cabinet with a forecast of what the Bank believes would happen in the event of a no deal Brexit. He was briefing the Cabinet on what preparations the Bank was making if that does happen, including last November's stress test.It was not a forecast. It was an apocalyptic test where the Bank deliberately sets the parameters beyond what might reasonably be expected to occur. The major banks all passed the test, giving reassurance that the financial system can cope with whatever happens next year.The Governor believes that a ""no deal"" scenario would be bad for the economy. But not as bad as the headlines today which are based on a doomsday scenario that is not actually forecast to happen.Read more from Kamal hereIn August, Mr Carney told the BBC that the risk of a no-deal Brexit was ""uncomfortably high"".That comment prompted leading Tory eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg to call Mr Carney ""the high priest of Project Fear"", while former minister Iain Duncan Smith said ""there is no such thing as a no-deal"" and the Bank ""struggled to understand how this would work"".Independent property expert Henry Pryor told the BBC that Mr Carney was ""not predicting Armageddon, he was not predicting house prices would fall by a third, they are just making sure that if, for some extraordinary reason anything was to go horribly wrong, the bank is prepared.""But he warned house prices were likely to fall in the first half of the 2019 as people put off buying amid the Brexit uncertainty, while the number of sellers, ""driven by death, debt and divorce"" would remain about the same. Following the Downing Street meeting, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said ministers remained confident of a Brexit deal, but had agreed to ""ramp up"" their no-deal planning.""As a responsible government, we need to plan for every eventuality. The Cabinet agreed that no-deal remains an unlikely but possible scenario in six months' time,"" the spokesman said.The Bank of England declined to comment.The cabinet meeting was part of a series of no-deal planning sessions designed to discuss the ""unlikely"" scenario that the UK leaves the EU without an agreement in place. After each meeting, planning papers are published on various subjects. On Thursday, the papers disclosed that UK car drivers may have to get an international driving permit if they want to drive in some European countries after a no-deal Brexit.The government said that after March 2019 ""your driving licence may no longer be valid by itself"" in the EU, in its latest no-deal planning papers.The papers also warned that Britons travelling to the EU may need to make sure their passports have six months left to run. And, in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government was trying to give the ""reassurance that consumers need"" on the issue of mobile phone roaming charges but admitted that European operators could pass on charges.He said: ""No, I can't give a cast-iron guarantee. What I can say is that the government would legislate to limit the ability of roaming charges to be imposed on customers."""
2018-09-13,Free phone roaming 'not guaranteed',https://web.archive.org//web/20180914024059/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45501007,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBritons visiting the EU could be hit with mobile phone roaming charges in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government would try to force firms to limit charges but he could not give a ""cast iron guarantee"" on the issue.The EU directive which capped the prices mobile phone operators could charge each other will no longer apply to the UK after Brexit. Mr Raab said that two mobile operators had agreed to keep free data roaming.And the government is proposing to cap any data charges at Â£45 a month. In an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, the Brexit secretary said the government was trying to give the ""reassurance that consumers need"" on the issue of mobile phone roaming charges but admitted that European operators could pass on charges.He said: ""No, I can't give a cast-iron guarantee. What I can say is that the government would legislate to limit the ability of roaming charges to be imposed on customers."" The government has published its latest contingency plans in the event of a no-deal Brexit. On mobile phone charges, the document says that ""in the unlikely event"" of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, consumers should ""check the roaming policies of your mobile operator before you go abroad"". The main points include:Mr Raab told Laura Kuenssberg Cabinet ministers earlier spent three hours examining ""all the plans across government to make sure we can manage, mitigate or avoid the risk of a no-deal scenario"".He also said there must be a ""shift across the board in the EU's approach"" on the issue of Northern Ireland: ""They will have to meet us halfway... if they meet the ambition, the pragmatism we've shown through our White Paper proposals then I'm confident we can get a good deal for this country, but also for the EU.""Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The only reason the government is talking about no-deal is because the Tory civil war on Europe prevents the prime minister from negotiating a good deal.""With the clock ticking, ministers should drop the irresponsible rhetoric and start putting jobs and the economy first.""Extra charges for people using their phones in another EU country were scrapped in June 2017. But the EU regulation banning them will not automatically be part of UK law after Brexit on 29 March next year.In theory this means UK mobile operators, if they want to, could reintroduce the charges that could make it expensive to use a mobile phone in another EU country.However, the government said it would legislate to make operators set a cap of Â£45 a month on data usage while abroad - in line with the current EU limit of â¬50.Mr Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme two mobile operators, Vodafone and Three, had publicly agreed not to bring back roaming charges for British citizens.The government was aiming to get a Brexit deal with Brussels by mid-November at the latest but was stepping up contingency planning in case that did not happen, he added.He said one of the consequences of a ""no deal"" Brexit ""is that obviously we wouldn't pay out the money that has been agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement"".The UK would ""recognise our strict legal obligations"" but that the amount paid would be ""significantly, substantially lower"" than the Â£39bn agreed with the EU.Analysis by BBC Political Correspondent Laura KuenssbergMinisters believe the chances of there being no agreement are now relatively small. They are hopeful that next week EU leaders will give helpful hints at a special meeting in Salzburg. Yet there is a long way to go until Dominic Raab, or anyone in government, can be sure. And don't doubt that many Tory MPs are adamant they simply won't vote for the kind of proposal Theresa May has put on the table. A senior EU diplomatic source told BBC News Mr Raab's divorce bill comments were ""a statement of the obvious"" as the financial settlement was part of the withdrawal agreement. ""The [EU27] will keep our heads cool as we always do,"" he added.Business leaders have repeatedly warned about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal, with the CBI saying the UK would face tariffs on 90% of its EU exports and a number of new regulatory hurdles.UK consumers could find going on holiday and making card payments for EU products more expensive because Britain would no longer be part of the EU's payments process.CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said the government's latest planning papers ""make clear firms would be hit with a sledgehammer in the event of no-deal"". ""They also illustrate the extent of the disruption consumers can expect if ideology wins over evidence."" There are also concerns about delays at the UK border.The Road Haulage Association has warned it will take ""an average of about 45 minutes to process one truck on both sides of the channel"" if customs checks are put in place. ""If that happens then the queues of HGVs in Kent will make the jams seen in the summer of 2015 appear as little more than waiting for the traffic lights to change,"" it adds.Mr Raab said there was a risk of disruption at the border if the EU did not respond ""with the collaborative spirit"" he said the UK ""would want to show"".The UK government was planning contra-flow systems on the M20 and was talking to EU member states about ""mitigating"" potential disruption. And he took a swipe at businesses, such as John Lewis, saying: ""I think it's probably rather easy at this moment in time for any business that isn't doing rather well to point to Brexit.""Please upgrade your browserLast month the government published 24 no-deal documents covering industries including medicine, finance and farming. There were warnings of extra paperwork at borders and extra credit card charges for Britons visiting the EU.More no-deal publications are expected in the coming weeks.Labour MP Ian Murray, a member of the campaign for another referendum, said: ""Nobody voted to make Britain poorer, to diminish our national influence or to ruin their holidays. ""The government has no mandate for any of this and it's too big an issue to be left to a Brexit elite in Westminster. That is why we must have a people's vote on the final Brexit deal."" "

Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson appeared in the chamber with Gabriel to listen to the closing remarks of a discussion about proxy voting.Proxy voting could allow MPs on maternity and paternity leave to nominate a colleague to cast their vote in their absence.Ms Swinson gave birth to Gabriel - her second child - on 29 June. MPs have often been seen in the Commons chamber with their children during votes, but not during active debates.Labour's Harriet Harman, the Mother of the House as the longest-serving female MP, stroked Gabriel's head after sitting next to Ms Swinson.Speaker John Bercow also shared a word with the mother and baby as they left.Ms Swinson, the MP for East Dunbartonshire, earlier warned the debate was ""too little, too late"" and went on to reference the debacle around her failed pairing with Tory chairman Brandon Lewis on key Brexit legislation.She said: ""This House first resolved that members with small babies should be able to vote by proxy seven months ago - since then Gabriel, Elijah and Solomon have been born and two more Commons babies are on the way.""A cynic might conclude that because all five pregnant and new mum MPs are on the opposition benches the government is trying to kick this issue into the long grass.""And after what happened to me in July I think I might be able to be forgiven for being cynical about the government's motivations.""Opening the debate, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said proxy voting would be a ""significant change"" as it would allow MPs ""for possibly for the first time ever"" to vote while not being present in parliament.She said: ""Proxy voting will be a profound change to the procedures of this House and so we must get it right to ensure robust voting practice for generations to come.""If we take this significant step now then, in my view, we will have a fairer, more inclusive parliament for future generations.""Mrs Leadsom said issues to be considered include whether proxy voting will only be limited to new parents, the types of Commons business it is allowed to be used for, and who should exercise such a vote on behalf of an MP."
2018-09-13,Snowden surveillance powers ruled unlawful,https://web.archive.org//web/20180914024059/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45510662,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK's bulk interception powers, exposed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, have been found to be illegal by the European Court of Human Rights. In a landmark judgement, the court ruled agencies had violated rights as there were no proper safeguards.The court crucially said bulk interception was legitimate and it had seen no evidence it had been abused.  Parliament reformed surveillance powers in 2016 and introduced a new watchdog. Critics say the system is still flawed.In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed that GCHQ - the UK's eavesdropping agency - had been secretly collecting communications sent over the internet on an industrial scale.It could reassemble the communications, filter them and then analyse the remainder for anything useful to protecting national security. Bulk surveillance programmes revealed: The agency could also obtain data and content from its US partners and companies including Apple, Google and Facebook. Campaigners argued that these collection systems violated the right to privacy - and on Thursday the European Court of Human Rights agreed. The judgement said the system revealed by Mr Snowden simply did not have any proper safeguards because it led to completely ""untargeted"" collection of information.In practice, this meant personal information could be seen by GCHQ, even if it had nothing to do with national security threats. The judgement said: ""While there is no evidence to suggest that the intelligence services are abusing their powers - on the contrary, the [then British watchdog] observed that the selection procedure was carefully and conscientiously undertaken by analysts, the court is not persuaded that the safeguards governing selection of bearers [internet cables] for interception and the selection of intercepted material for examination are sufficiently robust to provide adequate guarantees against abuse. ""Of greatest concern, however, is the absence of robust independent oversight of the selectors and search criteria used to filter intercepted communications.""The court also criticised powers to ask internet companies to hand over ""communications data"" - the basic technical facts of how people have exchanged information.  It said: ""The content of an electronic communication might be encrypted and, even if it were decrypted, might not reveal anything of note about the sender or recipient. ""The related communications data, on the other hand, could reveal the identities and geographic location of the sender and recipient and the equipment through which the communication was transmitted. ""In bulk, the degree of intrusion is magnified, since the patterns that will emerge could be capable of painting an intimate picture of a person through the mapping of social networks, location tracking, internet browsing tracking, mapping of communication patterns, and insight into who a person interacted with.""In 2016, Parliament passed the Investigatory Powers Act in a massive overhaul of surveillance law. A government spokeswoman said it would give ""careful consideration"" to the judgement - but added that new safeguards were already in place.""The Investigatory Powers Act 2016 replaced large parts of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) which was the subject of this challenge,"" she said.""This includes the introduction of a 'double lock' which requires warrants for the use of these powers to be authorised by a secretary of state and approved by a judge. ""An Investigatory Powers Commissioner has also been created to ensure robust independent oversight of how these powers are used.""But Jim Killock of Open Rights Group - one of the bodies behind the challenge - said:  ""Viewers of the BBC drama, Bodyguard, may be shocked to know that the UK actually has the most extreme surveillance powers in a democracy. ""Since we brought this case in 2013, the UK has actually increased its powers to indiscriminately surveil our communications whether or not we are suspected of any criminal activity. ""In light of today's judgment, it is even clearer that these powers do not meet the criteria for proportionate surveillance and that the UK government is continuing to breach our right to privacy.""Silkie Carlo, of Big Brother Watch, added: ""This landmark judgment confirming that the UK's mass spying breached fundamental rights vindicates Mr Snowden's courageous whistleblowing.""Lord David Anderson QC, the former independent terror laws watchdog, said that judgement was ""enormously important"" because the court had backed the use of bulk interception powers that had so worried Edward Snowden.""That should come as a relief - not only to the agencies who do this work, but the rest of us who they are trying to keep safe,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One.   ""I have looked pretty carefully at this over a number of years and there is no doubt in my mind that these powers are very useful - not just in counter-terrorism, but in cyber defence and at a much more everyday level they are useful for the police in fighting online sex crime, county lines and in a missing persons investigation.""What they [the judges] are doing are holding the feet of our new super regulator to the fire, and saying if you are going to give government these powers, then you have to look really closely at how they are authorised, how they are used and what happens to the data after it's been collected."""
2018-09-13,UK driving licence 'may not be valid in EU',https://web.archive.org//web/20180914024059/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45512152,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowUK drivers may have to get an international driving permit if they want to drive in some European countries after a no-deal Brexit.The government says that after March 2019 ""your driving licence may no longer be valid by itself"" in the EU, in its latest no-deal planning papers. It also warns that Britons travelling to the EU may need to make sure their passports have six months left to run.International permits cost Â£5.50 and are available at some post offices. A previous report from the National Audit Office suggested that between 100,000 and seven million international driving permits may need to be issued in the first year, if no Brexit deal is reached. AA president Edmund King said: ""This will be an extra burden for UK drivers wanting to take a holiday abroad. ""We envisage quite a rush on post offices next year for the Â£5.50 IDPs if no deal is reached.""Hopefully an agreement can be reached to prevent further red tape and expense for drivers.""The cabinet met earlier for a ""no deal"" planning session. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC that the government was aiming to get a Brexit deal with Brussels by mid-November at the latest but was stepping up contingency planning in case that did not happen.After the meeting, ministers published the latest series of papers outlining the work it has done to prepare for the ""unlikely"" scenario that the UK leaves the EU without a deal in place.While UK driving licences are currently valid in the EU, the papers say if no deal is reached, an international driving permit may be required - as it is currently to drive in Japan, some US states and other countries. It did not rule out that this could apply to Ireland - saying it will be up to the Irish government if they require an international driving permit from a UK driver. However, Ireland's National Driver Licence Service website says: ""As a visitor to Ireland, you can drive on a driving licence from any state outside the EU/EEA for up to a year provided the driving licence is current and valid."" Precise rules about permit requirements for non-EU licence holders varies between EU member states.There are two types of permit, depending on which EU state you are driving in. The government says the current process for getting one type of permit over the counter at the 90 post offices it is available at ""takes around five minutes on a turn-up-and-go basis"".It says it will start providing both types permits itself from February and applications will be made at 2,500 post offices across the UK.In the event of no deal, the papers also state that British passport holders would face different rules for travelling in countries which are part of the Schengen area - and would need passports that have at least three months to run from the intended departure date. As they would be allowed to stay up to 90 days, the actual check could end up being that the passport has six months left to run on arrival.This would not apply to travel to Ireland, because of the Common Travel Area between Ireland and the UK."
2018-09-13,Gordon Brown warns about next crisis,https://web.archive.org//web/20180914024059/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45504521,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe world is not ready to deal with another financial crisis, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has told the BBC. A breakdown in international co-operation means nations would be unable to act in a concerted way to tackle future threats - which are many.""I feel we're sleepwalking into the next crisis"", said Mr Brown, speaking on the 10th anniversary of the start of the previous crisis.He added that some of the bankers involved should have gone to jail.Mr Brown, speaking from his living room, said: ""This is a leaderless world and I think when the next crisis comes, and there will be a future crisis, we'll find that we neither have the fiscal or monetary room for manoeuvre or the willingness to take that action. ""But perhaps most worrying of all, we will not have the international co-operation necessary to get us out of a worldwide crisis.""In the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Wall Street banking giant Lehman Brothers, the UK government was one of the first to press the case for using public money to recapitalise failing banks and did exactly that - pumping taxpayer funds into Lloyds, HBOS and RBS.Mr Brown, UK prime minister as the crisis unfolded, said that it was possible to counteract the evaporation of trust in the markets by co-ordinated action between governments and regulators that trusted each other. ""But now with the trade wars, the disagreements over climate change, the nuclear deals that have fallen apart there is no spirit of co-operation - there is division and protectionism and I fear a new crisis would see nations trying to shift the blame to each other.""He acknowledged that the use of public money to bail out high earning bankers was a difficult pill for the public to swallow and although he insists it was necessary, he says that he is frustrated that harsher penalties weren't dished out to some of the bankers involved. ""I'll be honest with you. Some of these bankers should have gone to jail and until we have proper laws that can find the guilty and show there are clear penalties, then people will think the bankers have got away with it and will go back to doing the same thing again.""What blame does he bear himself? Former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn (Lord) King has been critical of the way his government designed the regulatory regime - moving bank supervision away from the central bank to the Financial Services Authority.Mr Brown acknowledges that it didn't work perfectly, but argues that the system was designed to look at isolated outbreaks of bank distress - not a contagion which consumed the entire global financial system. No national warning system, he says, was equipped to see the full picture and no individual country could have tackled the meltdown. A global problem needs global co-operation. Without that - and with most of the tools available already used (rock bottom interest rates, trillions pumped into the system through quantitative easing) - Mr Brown paints a grim picture of our ability to face the next crisis.

Migrants from outside the EU should be treated with the same ""fairness"" as EU migrants after Brexit, she added. The Conservatives said Labour's new policy would ""tear up the rules for people coming from outside the EU which would allow more low-skilled immigration"". Under the current system, non-EU migrants are rated on whether their skills are needed by the UK economy, with occupations ranked in tiers drawn up by the Migration Advisory Committee.Under Labour's plans ""anyone with specified bona fide skills can come here to work,"" Diane Abbott said in a speech.A ""new, integrated work visa"" would ""allow a future Labour government to ""offer rights of work and residency and accelerated citizenship to a range of professions, workers and those creating employment who want to come here,"" she added.""It will be available to all those we need to come here, whether it is doctors, or scientists, or care workers.""This will apply across a range of jobs, skills and professions. People coming to take up specific job offers, where it can be shown that those jobs cannot be filled by workers already resident here, will be able to come here.""We will use intelligence from the Migration Advisory Council, from trades unions, from employers - private and public - and from devolved governments and local and regional elected bodies to identify needs and to meet them.""The policy would ""sit alongside the existing visas for business trips, students, visitors and tourists"" and bring an end to ""the idiocy of preventing doctors and nurses from coming here to take up job offers"".Ms Abbott vowed to scrap the government's target of reducing net migration - the difference between those arriving in the UK and leaving - to below 100,000 a year.""The target had never been met and never will be met,"" she told the BBC, and called for ""a new conversation about migration that is not fixated on numbers"". She vowed to scrap the minimum income requirement for non-EU migrants and to give people ""more rights of family reunion"".What the party's policy towards migrants from the EU would be after Brexit would depend on what the current government agreed in Brussels, she told the BBC, but she wanted to see ""fairness"" between the two categories.""We want an immigration system which is fair, and which is managed, in the interests of the economy and the community as a whole,"" she added.The shadow home secretary is also pledging that Labour will abolish the Immigration Act 2014 and end the ""hostile environment"" policy deployed by the government, which she said had led to the Windrush scandal.But she insisted Labour would act against illegal immigration and ""make the system of deportation of overseas criminals much easier and smoother"".""If a judge issues a recommendation for deportation for serious criminals post-sentence, that should be carried out as a matter of routine. From the prison to the airport,"" she said in her speech.For the Conservatives, immigration minister Caroline Nokes said Labour had ""no interest in getting control of our borders as we leave the EU"".""Only the Conservatives will end free movement and build a fair and controlled immigration system,"" she added.

2018-09-13,Abortion clinic 'buffer zone' call rejected,https://web.archive.org//web/20180914024059/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45509202,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowCalls for buffer zones to be introduced outside abortion clinics to stop patients being harassed have been rejected by Home Secretary Sajid Javid.He said such protest-free areas around clinics in England and Wales ""would not be a proportionate response"".A Home Office review found cases of harassment and damaging behaviour but they were ""not the norm"", he added.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the decision was a ""shocking failure to protect women"" and should be reversed.  In a written statement, Mr Javid said the review had gathered evidence that showed protesters' behaviour had left patients distressed and caused some to rebook their appointments and not to follow medical advice.He said that in some cases, protesters handed out model foetuses, displayed graphic images, followed people, blocked their paths and even assaulted them.However, he added that the review showed these activities were ""not the norm"" and most anti-abortion activities were ""more passive"", such as praying, displaying banners and handing out leaflets. In 2017, 363 hospitals and clinics in England and Wales carried out abortions - 36 of which experienced anti-abortion demonstrations, according to the review.Mr Javid said: ""Having considered the evidence of the review, I have therefore reached the conclusion that introducing national buffer zones would not be a proportionate response, considering the experiences of the majority of hospitals and clinics, and considering that the majority of activities are more passive in nature.""He went on to say that there was already legislation - such as the Public Order Act 1986 - in place that restricted protest activities which caused harm to others.Defending the decision, Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told the Commons the government would continue with the current scheme of enabling councils to apply for Public Space Protection Orders.In April, the west London council of Ealing took matters into their own hands, imposing a 100m protest-free ""buffer zone"" outside a Marie Stopes clinic.But the constituency MP, Labour's Rupa Huq, said it was a ""national problem that requires a national solution"".She told the Commons the conclusions were ""a bit disappointing"".""It seems to be saying there has to be a disproportionate number of women affected before any action takes place,"" she added.Speaking later to the BBC, she said shoving the burden onto already cash-strapped local authorities was not the best solution, and would leave women running ""a gauntlet of a barrage of abuse just to have their NHS procedure done"".Mr Javid's predecessor, Amber Rudd, who launched the review last year, has previously said it was ""unacceptable"" that anyone should feel intimidated at a clinic.However, Ms Rudd, who resigned as home secretary in April, told the Commons that now that she could ""travel slightly less conspicuously"", she had visited the Ealing clinic.She told MPs there was ""no harassment continuing which, I believe, continues to reflect what has been concluded"" in the government's announcement.Clare Murphy, of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, which provides abortion services in the UK, said the charity would seek to work with councils to roll out the Ealing ""model"" across the country to protect women and clinic staff from protesters.The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said Public Spaces Protection Orders could be useful but had not been designed for this purpose.

The owner of the John Lewis department store chain and Waitrose said it continued to expect annual profits to be ""substantially lower than last year"".Mr Raab also said the government was preparing for a no-deal Brexit despite being confident that eventuality would not come to pass: ""Getting a deal with the European Union is still by far and away the most likely outcome.""This week Ralf Speth, the boss of Jaguar Land Rover, warned the government needed to get ""the right Brexit"" or risk wiping out profits at the UK's biggest carmaker and trigger big job cuts.Meanwhile, the Brexit secretary welcomed a promise by two mobile operators, Vodafone and Three, not to impose Europe roaming charges for UK customers if Britain leaves the bloc with no deal.""What we have said is we would like to see other companies following suit, but, in any event, we would legislate for a limit on roaming charges to make sure in a no-deal scenario that we protect British consumers,"" Mr Raab said.A new raft of technical papers is being released by the government on Thursday outlining the impact of a no-deal Brexit on business and consumers.Mr Raab also accused those warning about shortages of food and medicines after a no-deal withdrawal of ""scaremongering"", saying it was ""nonsense"" to claim UK supermarkets would run out of food."

A quarter of a percentage point rise last month took rates to the highest level since March 2009.The European Central Bank also kept eurozone interest rates unchanged at 0% on Thursday. The MPC said in the minutes of its September meeting there were mounting fears about the UK leaving with the EU without a deal agreed.""Since the committee's previous meeting, there had been indications, most prominently in financial markets, of greater uncertainty about future developments in the withdrawal process,"" it said.The Bank's regional staff reported that businesses were cracking down on costs and holding back on investment ahead of Brexit.However, it raised the forecast for UK economic growth in the third quarter from 0.4% to 0.5%, partly due to stronger consumer spending over the unusually warm summer.The MPC flagged heightened risks to global growth following trade tensions between the US and China and turbulence in some emerging markets.Sterling was flat at $1.3051 and â¬1.1221 after the decision was announced.The minutes showed recent rises in economic and wages growth had not affected the MPC's commitment to ""gradual"" and ""limited"" rate rises in the coming years, said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics said expected two rate rises next year and another two in 2020, bringing rates to 1.75%, assuming a Brexit deal was struck and the economy held up well.""That would be above the market expectation for just two hikes over the next three years - but still consistent with the MPC's guidance,"" she said.Ben Brettell at Hargreaves Lansdown said: ""Policymakers are firmly in 'wait-and-see' mode having raised rates last month, and will be reluctant to even consider another move until they have a clear idea of what Brexit will look like. ""Realistically May next year looks the first available opportunity to raise rates to 1%.""Last month the Bank signalled that rates would need to rise by about 0.25 percentage points over the next two or three years to bring inflation, which stands at 2.5%, back to target.September's MPC minutes also revealed that the recent energy price cap announced by Ofgem would reduce inflation by more than expected over the course of 2019."

Then, many in the party felt that the existing top brass had passed their best, and the Conservatives needed fresh thinking and leadership. The slogan may have baggage, but more than a decade later, that question rather sums up why the suggestion from former minister George Freeman, on Thursday evening, that Theresa May should move on after March, can't be easily ignored. Very few Tory MPs want to say it publicly, but if they asked each other, ""Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"" many of them would confess, and admit privately in conversation that once the Brexit deal is done and we have left the EU in the spring, then Theresa May should make clear her intention not to fight the next election at a minimum.  Many believe that she should depart, or say that she is off almost immediately after that moment. Mr Freeman is not trying to push her out now and was effusive in praise for how she's managed so far. But his comments underline a widespread private assumption shared by many MPs and some ministers too - which of course may turn out to be wrong - that once the tortuous process of getting out of the EU is done, the best hope for the Tories of turning the page on the whole saga, is a new face at the helm. One senior MP, who is trying their best, for now, to keep the very rocky show on the road and who knows Theresa May well and has advised her many times told me: ""In March she's gone. Either she will have to set that out or people like me will tell her she has to go. ""If she doesn't say she's off, the letters will go in, and that will be it, so we can move on.""Some of the ministers seeking to make their mark have notions that they have a few months to do that before a potential contest. Remember, one of the big reasons that there hasn't been a leadership contest so far is that no wannabe wanted to take on the problems of Brexit. Once we have actually left, while many decisions and complexities will linger, the UK will have actually left, which should, in theory at least, create a space to change the political conversation. This is not about a handful of Brexiteers agitating to shove her out rudely because they don't like the direction of travel for the next few months. It's not about saying that there will be a sudden schism and they will crash into a leadership contest. But it's about a general sense across different wings of the Conservative Party, that Theresa May's time and political energy will have been run down by Brexit. Hold on for a minute. Politics is a rollercoaster - of course this is not inevitable. One government minister was furious this week when I asked about the very assumption that Mrs May could have less than a year in office, lambasting colleagues for discussing the subject, practically claiming that it's not a genuine topic of conversation. Another of her Cabinet allies told me tonight that ""if she delivers a good Brexit deal and the country is still moving forward, then Theresa May will still find herself in a very good position"", with the potential of leading the country and staying on for years to come. Certainly, time after time Theresa May has surprised and defied those who've tried to tear her down. What is the case though, is that many Tories have already made their minds up, that her time will be up within the next year. And in articulating his view publicly, Mr Freeman is saying what huge numbers of his colleagues have been thinking too. "
2018-09-13,No-deal preparations,https://web.archive.org//web/20180914024059/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45514495,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA lot of hassle and potential cost for a lot of people. The government's spent the afternoon giving details of what might need to happen, if there was no deal with the EU.There's no guarantee you'd be able to avoid big phone bills if you use your mobile abroad, although ministers say they'd cap any data charges at Â£45 a month and some of the firms say they won't change prices. If you want to go on the road on the continent, you might need an International Driving Permit. If you want to jump on a cheap flight for a last-minute weekend, better check you have six months left on your passport, or you might be turned back.If there isn't a deal, many products tested in the UK after Brexit will have to go through the same process again - but with an EU authority in charge. The list of what might have to happen is a very long one. And some of the trickiest implications, like what would happen to planes flying between European and British skies, haven't even been published yet. And as the French foreign minister suggested, the Eurostar might not be able to run, and yes, planes may not be able to fly if a resolution can't be found. Publishing the papers are part of the government's plan to look like they are prepared for the potential shock and disruption of the negotiations failing. And indeed, for some in government, publicly detailing those preparations is part of a tactic to suggest that they have a way out and are ready to walk away, if Brussels doesn't budge. What ministers won't say, however, is how much money we might have to pay the EU if there were to be no deal. The Brexit secretary and the prime minister have both repeatedly said that the estimated price tag of nearly Â£40bn if there is a deal would not be paid in full. But they refuse point blank to give an assessment of how much it would be, if we walked away without an agreement. The reality is the cost would probably still be many billions, and it would take lawyers many, many years to be able to agree on it. In that situation, the government would be walking away without being able to tell MPs or the public how much we would still have to stump up. Ministers' belief, however, is that the chances of there being no agreement are now relatively small. They are hopeful that next week EU leaders will give helpful hints at a special meeting in Salzburg. On Thursday, the Brexit secretary told me he believes the EU will meet the UK ""half way"" on the Irish border issue, which for many many months has been the trickiest issue of all.Yet there is a long way to go until he, or anyone in government, can be sure. And don't doubt that many Tory MPs are adamant they simply won't vote for the kind of proposal Theresa May has put on the table. One senior MP told me: ""If people in Number 10 haven't made clear to her that 'Chequers minus minus' isn't going to get through the Commons, then she is getting the wrong advice."" After all, there are two kinds of ""no deal"" - one seems very unlikely, where the EU and the UK simply can't agree. The prime minister comes back to Parliament and says: ""I'm sorry, I tried, but it just won't wash.""But the other is that Theresa May comes back with a deal but her party, and Parliament, chucks it out. The political climate would be different in those two cases. But in the potential chaos of either, the hassle outlined on Thursday might just be the start. "

There is massive frustration with her leadership, her position on Chequers and the way her proposals tuck the UK closely into the EU in perpetuity. And yes, there are some MPs who want to see her gone immediately. However senior voices in the European Research Group - yes them - are adamant that it is not the time to try to oust the PM. It would be ""stupid"", one told me last night. Imagine in these critical weeks of the Brexit negotiations if the UK started to try to change the prime minister. Right now those jostling to remove her know they don't have any guarantees they would have the numbers to force her out, even though they may well be able to pull together enough MPs to submit letters to the chair of 1922 committee to trigger a contest.So are the Eurosceptics coldly gaming the options for how to get their way? Does that include discussing if, when and how, they could try to push the prime minister out of office? Absolutely. But does it mean we are on the verge of a coup being launched against Number 10? Things can change very fast these days. But don't be so sure."
2018-09-13,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180914024059/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45488124,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA group of Tory MPs has endorsed a plan for a ""clean break"" from the European Union (EU), with the UK defaulting to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules when it leaves the EU. The proposals are contained in a report by the pressure group Economists for Free Trade (EFT). Here's an initial look at a few of the claims they've made. These figures are based on a number of calculations and assumptions, not all of which stand up to scrutiny. Those who have modelled a clean Brexit properly, the EFT asserts, report long-term gains from free trade of 2%-4% of GDP. The report dismisses alternative modelling - done by the Treasury and by Whitehall's Cross Departmental Brexit Analysis - which arrived at very different conclusions. But that is part of the problem. The EFT are convinced that they are the only people who have modelled the data correctly - even though theirs is a minority view.""The vast majority of economists think it will be different,"" says Prof Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex.""Because a hard Brexit will cut trade with the EU, which is by far our largest trading partner, significantly.""Chequers plan 'worse than status quo'What is the 'no deal' WTO option?Last year the UK exported almost Â£274bn in goods and services to the EU, compared with Â£112bn to the US. When it comes to imports, the UK imported Â£341bn in goods and services from the EU and Â£70bn from the US.  For those who love the detail, here is one example of economists who criticise the EFT's methodology. Tory supporters of Brexit are, however, unbowed: ""Perhaps it's our fault,"" says leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, ""by not putting the argument for a world trade deal earlier, we left the running to people who don't want us to leave the EU at all.""The EFT report also says the UK would no longer have to pay a net amount of Â£12bn to the EU every year, although that figure appears to be slightly inflated.According to the Treasury net payments to the EU amounted to Â£9.6bn in 2016 and Â£8.9bn in 2017. Forecasts over the next five years suggest that - if the UK were to stay in the EU - net payments to the EU would rise to roughly Â£11bn a year.The EFT report goes on to  suggests that the UK could choose to withhold ""most or all"" of the estimated Â£39bn financial settlement that the government has provisionally agreed to pay the EU as part of a Withdrawal Agreement. In theory, the UK could do that, but it would probably prompt a legal challenge from the EU, and it would certainly damage relations severely at a time when - as the EFT report suggests - the government would be looking for co-operation in a whole series of policy areas. It says only 4% of goods arriving in the UK from non-EU countries are subject to checks, and it suggests that trade with the EU in future could therefore be almost as seamless as it is now.  It's correct that very few physical or documentary checks are carried out on non-EU goods. But evidence given to the Home Affairs Select Committee suggests that things are rather more complicated than that. If a lorry arrives at Dover, for example, from a non-EU country, it is usually delayed by 60 to 90 minutes even if no checks are made. The UK could choose to speed up that process and abolish many checks, but there would still be far more checks on UK goods being exported to the EU via Dover. There would also be further complications for UK exports. Once the UK is designated as a third country by the EU, all UK exports of animal origin would only be able to enter EU territory via a veterinary border inspection post, where there are often time-consuming physical inspections as well as documentary checks. Neither the Eurotunnel nor the Calais port is currently designated as a veterinary border inspection post. The EFT report says that under WTO rules sanitary and phytosanitary measures (ie safety checks on food) can't be used as a ""surreptitious means of inhibiting cross-border trade"". This is true, but that does not erase what are known as non-tariff-barriers entirely, it simply reduces inspections where possible. ""The only countries that have managed to remove the need for health checks on food being exported to the EU,"" says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform, ""are the European Economic Area members and Switzerland. They have not only implemented EU rules in this area domestically, they also apply EU checks on all imports of animal origin entering from the rest of the world."" The EFT report also suggests lifting tariffs (or import charges) on imported goods to make prices cheaper. It recognises that if you do that for one country, you have to do it for every country, under WTO rules. If tariffs were removed for all agricultural produce, cheap imports would flood in and food prices would fall - but the UK farming industry could be decimated. So, the report says, that ""perhaps the most attractive goods to target"" might be ones that we don't produce in the UK at all. It mentions oranges as one example, but it would be a pretty limited number of goods.  Again, others are extremely sceptical about the EFT's policy proposals. According to a report published earlier this year by the House of Lords European Union Committee, ""EU food imports cannot easily be replaced by either producing more in the UK or importing more from non-EU countries"". The Lords report forecast that food prices were likely to rise without a Brexit deal. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-09-13,Corbyn's questions,https://web.archive.org//web/20180914024059/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45488134,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJeremy Corbyn is increasingly willing to challenge the government on Brexit, according to a BBC analysis of Prime Minister's Questions since the EU referendum.Since the turn of the year, two fifths of the Labour leader's questions have been about the United Kingdom's imminent departure from the European Union and Mr Corbyn now seems more determined to challenge the government consistently on this issue. In the last 10 PMQs, Corbyn has chosen to address Brexit with 42 out of a possible 60 questions - exactly 70% of the time. Of the 14 that weren't about Brexit, six were about buses and another eight were about the NHS, although two of these followed on from a line of questioning about Theresa May's promise to pour a supposed ""Brexit dividend"" back into healthcare.Of course, there are different ways of classifying his questions - a question can be about more than one subject - but by my reckoning this has made Brexit the most common theme of Mr Corbyn's questions since he became leader.Despite this, Mr Corbyn has been criticised in the past for skirting the issue, when he has the opportunity to put the government on the spot. In total, since the EU referendum on 23 June 2016, he has asked 105 questions about Brexit. That equates to just over 27% of all the questions he has asked in that time. But they haven't come in one steady stream. Between 25 January and 22 November 2017, Mr Corbyn only referred to Brexit in one question, and that - on 25 October - was to list the lack of no-deal planning alongside a number of other examples of alleged government incompetence. The prime minister had no trouble evading the issue in her response.Mr Corbyn did respond to statements made to the House by the prime minister after key EU summits and after PMQs on 29 March 2017, the day Article 50 was triggered. But PMQs is an opportunity for the leader of the opposition to take the initiative and to drive the debate. Over those 10 months, he chose instead to speak about public sector pay cuts, the sweetheart deal for Surrey Council, Theresa May holding Donald Trump's hand, changes to National Insurance for the self-employed, zero hours contracts, universal credit, tax avoidance, school places, Grenfell Tower and the NHS.It was left to Emily Thornberry to probe the government on Brexit when she deputised for Mr Corbyn on 12 July 2017. The shadow foreign secretary grilled then deputy prime minister Damian Green with six straight questions about the government's no-deal planning.The picture has gradually changed since. As Labour has shifted towards a softer position on Brexit, Mr Corbyn has begun to ramp up the pressure in PMQs. There was a clutch of 12 questions at the end of 2017 and another dozen at the end of February, before he turned the heat up from May.Critics might complain about Mr Corbyn's execution, but they can no longer say that he is not talking about Brexit. All of which goes to prove the old adage: you wait for one Brexit question and then 42 come along all at once."
2018-09-13,Keep calm and carry on,https://web.archive.org//web/20180914024059/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45479549,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBefore 'keep calm and carry on' was a phrase that appeared on cushions, mugs, fridge magnets, and memes, it was a useful phrase to describe a particularly British attitude demonstrated by unflashy politicians who ignored (or should we say tried to ignore) colleagues who were looking for limelight, concentrated on what they were trying to get done and went back for more when times got rough.And, if you can forget the over-use of what was a wartime propaganda phrase, it is still an instruction that is useful to characterise much of the prime minister's attitude. Indeed, when she's chosen a more dramatic tack it sometimes has not exactly gone well. Calling the election in 2017, her biggest strategic mistake, was an entirely unnecessary drama.And as the real crunch period for Brexit approaches, KCACO (surely there's a Whitehall acronym for this somewhere) is firmly the prime minister's approach.And despite the disagreements in the Tory party being ventilated every moment, Theresa May has, in public at least, little intention of overreacting - if reacting at all.The new heat of the Tory despair and disagreements is because we are now, at last you might say, nearing at least the beginning of the end of the Brexit process.There is less than a school term to go before the overall political deal is meant to be done. The stakes therefore are huge. And when times are anxious, the smallest thing can cause outrage or ecstasy.So in this kind of political atmosphere, every word, every warning, every stray comment, every indiscretion can send people screaming to slam the panic button.Inside government the plan is to keep going, take the knocks, carry on, however strong the resistance is, and to make a more determined effort to try to persuade people of the merits of their proposal.There is frustration inside government that the prime minister hasn't made more effort to expound the benefits of the Chequers approach. She did, after all, make chunky speeches on previous occasions when there were big developments in the government's thinking. Not this time.But in the frenetic run-up to the Tory conference, government ministers will be despatched around the country to at least try to get Tory Party members on side.But the calculation inside government is, as it has been throughout this very bumpy road, that in the end, there will be a Brexit deal and that a majority of MPs will be too alarmed at the prospect of no deal with the EU, which would mean no two year period of getting used to it, to do more than flirt with the notion of voting it down.In the end therefore, the government's assumption is that a deal would go through because of old-fashioned common sense.Here's the thing - politics is not always governed by common sense. People are also motivated by conviction, by ideology, by identity, by emotion, and a different kind of common sense.To many Tories in government it is common sense to try to stay as close to the EU as possible to try to minimise disruption. To many others, that's simply the wrong way to look at Brexit.And those Conservatives who want looser ties are very serious about what they are trying to do which is no less than force her to change tack.Theresa May is trying very hard to KCACO.  She's showing no sign of budging - perhaps her deal will acquire a sense of inevitability. But despite warmer words from Brussels, at home with no majority Theresa May won't have the luxury of ignoring her critics forever."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.3%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-13,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180914024059/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

On the first day of their four-day conference in Brighton, the Lib Dems will discuss the Windrush scandal, animal welfare and decentralisation among other issues.But the event is likely to be dominated by questions over the party's future direction, after Sir Vince - who will make his keynote speech on Tuesday - called for a major overhaul of its membership and election rules to counter claims it lacked popular appeal and was struggling to be heard. His proposals, which are likely to be debated but not voted on at this year's event, could allow people to join the party for free and non-members to vote in future leadership elections. Most controversially, he has floated the idea of future leadership contests being opened up to people who are not MPs. The party currently has 12 MPs and Sir Vince was elected unopposed last year.He told the Press Association that his party - which backs a referendum on the final Brexit deal - could provide a home to those ""fed up with the extremes of the current Conservative and Labour parties"".""Whether you see yourself as a liberal, social democrat, progressive, or centrist there is a home for you here, particularly as we fight Brexit together,"" he said.""I have made proposals to open up our movement to become an even more powerful force at the centre of British politics, standing up to power and privilege to bring fairness and opportunity for everyone.""The party said 10,000 people had pre-registered their interest to become party members since Sir Vince announced the proposals earlier this month.

2018-09-14,Brexit vote watchdog 'got law wrong',https://web.archive.org//web/20180915024754/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45519676,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Electoral Commission misinterpreted EU referendum spending laws allowing Vote Leave to break them, the High Court has ruled.Vote Leave paid Â£625,000 to clear bills allegedly run up by university student Darren Grimes.The watchdog initially said it had no grounds to suspect this was a scheme to get round spending limits.It later changed its mind and fined Vote Leave and Mr Grimes - and also referred him to the police.The High Court agreed with the Electoral Commission finding in July that Vote Leave had broken the law, but said the watchdog had misinterpreted the rules, in the run-up to the June 2016 referendum, in advice it gave to the Leave campaign.Vote Leave's former chief executive Matthew Elliott said that if the Electoral Commission did not launch an appeal against the ruling it would be admitting it had given incorrect advice and should drop its fines.Anti-Brexit campaigner and Labour peer Lord Adonis said: ""It sounds to me as if the Electoral Commission has not been doing its job properly. On the face of it, it seems to have been extremely incompetent.""He told the BBC's Politics Live that if there was another EU referendum, which he wants to see, ""we need a rather more fit and proper body to be in charge of it"".The Electoral Commission said the High Court ""arrived at the same conclusion as the Commission did in its investigation - that Vote Leave should have accounted for the expenditure on the digital services firm, AggregateIQ - although it found an additional reason for reaching that conclusion"". The Commission's chief executive Claire Bassett said: ""The High Court has not ruled on the advice we gave to Vote Leave. Our advice was generic and covered hypothetical scenarios. ""At no point did we give any advice or discuss payments to Aggregate IQ. ""Suggestions made otherwise today on social media are categorically untrue.  ""Put simply, today's ruling states that donations from one campaign group to another are lawful, but that those donations must be declared as expenditure by the person or campaign group making the donation, if it is for a specific purpose. This is something that Vote Leave did not do.""In his judgement, Lord Justice Leggatt said the Electoral Commission had ""misinterpreted the definition of 'referendum expenses'"" as defined by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendum Act.He added: ""The source of its error is a mistaken assumption that an individual or body which makes a donation to a permitted participant cannot thereby incur referendum expenses.  ""As a result of this error, the Electoral Commission has interpreted the definition in a way that is inconsistent with both the language and the purpose of the legislation.""Vote Leave's donation to Mr Grimes, which went straight to its Canadian digital agency AggregateIQ, should have counted as part of Vote Leave's campaign expenses, added the judge. ""The position would have been different if the money had been given to Mr Grimes for him to use however he chose in promoting a 'leave' outcome of the referendum,"" he added.But the judge said there was no ""rational basis"" for the watchdog's actions, which he described a ""recipe for abuse"" of the law.Jolyon Maugham QC of the Good Law Project, which brought the High Court challenge, said the ruling proved the watchdog ""unlawfully tilted the playing field in favour of Leave"" in the 2016 referendum.""Stronger In (the official Remain campaign) was also up against its spending limits. ""But because it didn't get the advice from the Electoral Commission it had to stop spending. And the High Court decided that advice was wrong.""He said ""heads should roll"" at the Electoral Commission over the error.Matthew Elliott, former chief executive of Vote Leave, said the High Court ruling had ""thrown electoral law for future elections and referendums into total chaos"". ""Either the Electoral Commission is wrong or the High Court is wrong. ""Should the Electoral Commission choose not to appeal this judgment, they will be admitting that they gave Vote Leave incorrect advice and they should immediately reconsider the unfair fines they are seeking to impose on us,"" he added.""Vote Leave would not have made the donations that it did, had it not been for the Commission's clear advice. ""This whole situation is a mess of the Electoral Commission's own making, and their defeat in the High Court today must force a rethink. ""They now have a chance to rectify their errors. They should do the right thing.""  "
2018-09-14,I'll stand for leader if asked - Tory MP,https://web.archive.org//web/20180915024754/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45519604,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMP George Freeman has said he will put his name forward to be the next Tory leader if ""asked to"" amid continuing speculation over Theresa May's future.It comes after the ex-minister, who once chaired Mrs May's policy board, said there should be leadership contest next summer after Brexit was settled. He said he was ""no Michael Heseltine"" and would ""stand back"" if top figures from the ""next generation"" emerged.Mrs May has said she will serve as long as her party wants her to.Michael, now Lord, Heseltine launched a Conservative leadership challenge to Margaret Thatcher in 1990, triggering a contest won by John Major, after Lady Thatcher resigned as PM.Earlier this week, pro-Brexit MPs unhappy with Theresa May's Chequers blueprint for future co-operation with the EU openly discussed her future. This led to a backlash from senior figures such as Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith, who described leadership speculation as ""loose talk"" that should be stamped upon.  Downing Street has insisted there is no vacancy and the PM is focused on delivering the best outcome for the UK as it prepares to leave the EU this Spring. Negotiations on the terms of the UK's exit are entering their final stages, with both sides hoping for an agreement by the start of November at the latest.The UK and EU want to agree an outline statement on their future relations at the same time. By BBC political correspondent Jonathan BlakeIf you're thinking ""should I know who this guy is?"", don't worry, the answer - unless you're a keen Westminster watcher - is no. As George Freeman himself said - ""If I was still advising Theresa May..."" - which of course he isn't, having resigned as the chair of her policy board in November last year. But should the prime minister be worried? It's hard to ignore the fact that an MP has pointedly said in public that it is time for their leader to set a date for their departure. And this week others were slapped down by senior colleagues for expressing their frustration with Theresa May's leadership over Brexit. But if George Freeman has an organised campaign of supporters in Parliament, which he would need to be a serious contender, he is keeping it very well hidden. He also qualified his own leadership intention with the use of that key two letter word 'if' - ""If people want me to in Parliament, I will,"" he said. As one MP put it; ""I can't imagine who would ask him."" Ouch. But Tories who back a Canada-style trade deal with the EU have threatened to block the PM's Chequers plan, which proposes a much closer relationship, when the issue is voted on in Parliament in the autumn. Mr Freeman, who voted Remain in the 2016 referendum and was seen as ally of former leader David Cameron, quit as Mrs May's policy adviser in November last year over concerns about the direction of the party.He told BBC Radio Norfolk it should be up to a new leader to decide the UK's future relationship with the EU.The Mid-Norfolk MP said there should be a leadership contest next summer, lasting no more than three months, to determine the party's future direction, and he was prepared to throw his hat into the ring.""If the question is 'will I stand, the answer is if people want me to in Parliament, I will.""The next leader, he said, should come from the new crop of Tory politicians elected since 2010 - ""not the old faces"" as he described them - at least 10 of whom he suggested could do the job.""I would like to see the whole range of candidates stand. I would like a democratic Conservative Party choose the right leader. I'd like to see the nation see the breadth of talent we have"". But Mr Freeman indicated that he would not challenge Mrs May and would ""stand back and champion"" another candidate if they represented the ""right package of ideas"".""I did not sit down with a plan 20 years ago to become prime minister,"" he added.Mr Freeman said the advantage of having a contest next summer was that the issue of whether Brexit would happen would be settled by then and the party would, instead ""be debating where we take it"".And he said the Conservatives needed to focus on other issues, apart from Brexit and deficit, if they were to persuade young people that they were not ""technocratic, burnt-out and energy less"". Fellow Tory MP Tom Tugendhat has also called for ""a generational shift"" in the leadership of the party if and when Mrs May stands down. He told the Spectator: ""The vast majority of my generation wants to stop banging on about Europe. We want to talk about the optimism we feel in this country.' "
2018-09-14,Union boss criticised over Israel comments,https://web.archive.org//web/20180915024754/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45517094,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA trade union leader has been recorded suggesting that Israel ""created"" the anti-Semitism row in the Labour Party.In a recording published by the Independent, PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka suggested the country had created the story to hide what he called its own ""atrocities"".Labour Against Anti-Semitism said Mr Serwotka had brought the entire TUC into disrepute and he should resign.The PCS said he had made the point that anti-Semitism must be opposed.Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ""By trading in conspiracy theories and stock anti-Semitic tropes, Mark Serwotka has demeaned his office. ""The only reason Labour's anti-Semitism crisis remains in the media is Labour's failure to deal with it. ""Mr Serwotka should apologise or face disciplinary action from the TUC and the Public and Commercial Services Union.""And Matt Zarb-Cousin, Jeremy Corbyn's former spokesman, said the comments were wrong and ""very unhelpful"".  The Independent reported that Mr Serwokta had told an event organised by the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign at the TUC this week that there was no place for anti-Semitism in the Labour movement.""I think it's unfortunate that the Labour Party allowed a lot of this to drag on, in a way that actually didn't help anybody,"" he said.But he cited the controversial decision by US President Donald Trump to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and the unspecified killing by Israeli troops of ""dozens of Palestiniansâ¦ unarmed, innocent civilians"" as among the real issues being distracted from by ""a summer of asking ourselves whether leading Labour movement people are in any way anti-Semitic?"".""Now I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I'll tell you what - one of the best forms of trying to hide from the atrocities that you are committing is to go on the offensive and to actually create a story that does not exist for people on this platform, the trade union movement or, I have to say, for the leader of the Labour Party,"" he said.Mr Serwotka is general secretary of the largest civil service trade union, the Public and Commercial Services Union, a post he has held since December 2000. He was re-elected in 2005, 2009 and 2014.In 2015 he was among people banned from voting in Labour's leadership election on the grounds they did not share the party's ""aims and values"" - new rules had allowed non-members to vote as ""registered supporters"". In 2016, he rejoined the Labour Party after 25 years, saying Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offered a ""genuine break from the past"".On Wednesday it was announced that had been elected TUC president for the coming year.Labour has been dealing with a row about the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than two years. A 2016 inquiry, carried out by Shami Chakrabarti, concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism, there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". But the row over the way the leadership has handled anti-Semitism allegations continued and dominated media coverage of the party over the summer. There was much controversy over a new code of conduct the party adopted on anti-Semitism, amid criticism it did not go as far as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's guidelines.Veteran MP Frank Field quit the party's parliamentary group in August, saying the leadership was becoming a ""force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". Earlier this month the party's ruling body agreed to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism.Mr Corbyn has apologised for hurt caused by anti-Semitism in the party and pledged to stamp it out.He has stressed that people who hold anti-Semitic views ""have no place in the Labour Party"" and said people who use ""anti-Semitic poison"" are not his supporters, nor do they speak for him or the party.A spokesperson for the Public and Commercial Services Union said: ""Mark spoke at a Palestine Solidarity Campaign fringe event at the TUC - an organisation PCS is affiliated to.""He made the point at the start of the meeting, that we need to oppose anti-Semitism in society and within the Labour movement.""But we should not allow the issue of anti-Semitism to be used by people who are attempting to silence Palestinian voices as they legitimately struggle for their rights and a sovereign state."""
2018-09-14,Davidson: PM critics must 'quit the noise',https://web.archive.org//web/20180915024754/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-45519651,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Scottish Conservative leader has urged Theresa May's critics to ""quit the noise"" and ""let the woman do her job"". Ruth Davidson said the prime minister should be given the space to negotiate the best deal possible with the EU. And she called on the rival factions within the Tory party to recognise the need for compromise over Brexit.She also ruled out leaving the Scottish Parliament for Westminster before the next Holyrood election in 2021.Ms Davidson, who is due to give birth to her first child next month, was speaking to BBC Scotland amid mounting speculation about the prime minister's future.The MP George Freeman has openly called for a leadership contest next summer after Brexit is settled. There have also been strong rumours that former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a leading Brexiteer, is considering challenging Mrs May for the leadership after recently describing her Brexit plans as a ""suicide vest"". Ms Davidson said the prime minister was currently in the midst of some of the ""toughest and most complex"" negotiations about the future of the country since the Second World War.And she urged politicians from all sides to temper their language during the current ""febrile"" debate over Brexit.She added: ""What I would say to a number of my colleagues who are making noises right now is let the woman do her job, let her deliver for the country. ""There is a really important job to do right now. The prime minister is applying herself - this is her duty to deliver for the country. Let her do it and let's get behind her as she does it.""She's the prime minister of this country and she needs to have people quit the noises off and let her deliver in this really crucial moment in our country's history. ""Ms Davidson - who has been tipped by some as a future leader of the UK party - said she had backed Ms May's leadership bid two years ago, and would continue to support her now and for however long she wished to remain in the job.She said decisions made in the weeks ahead would ""define the road of travel"" for the country over the coming years, and said she was keen to give the prime minister the space to negotiate the best possible Brexit deal for the country.She also predicted that, when a deal is agreed with the EU and comes back to the House of Commons for consideration, it would ""focus the minds"" of MPs. Ms Davidson added: ""As a committed Remainer I am not going to get everything I want out of this deal, and neither is a committed Brexiteer that is on the other side, but deals are about compromise.""Ms Davidson gave a wide-ranging interview to BBC Scotland, with the other topics covered including:Rumours she will quit Holyrood for WestminsterMs Davidson said her job was in Scotland. She said she wanted to retain her Edinburgh Central seat at the next Holyrood election in 2021 and become the country's next first minister - and the first Conservative first minister. She added: ""I am going to be based here and I am going to be taking on Nicola Sturgeon in 2021.""Divisions within the 13 Scottish Conservative MPs over BrexitDespite Ms Davidson being a high-profile supporter of Remain during the referendum, some of her party's 13 MPs are hardline Brexiteers - with Ross Thomson in particular being a vocal critic of the prime minister's Chequers proposals.Ms Davidson said all 650 MPs had differing opinions over Brexit, ranging from those who still want to remain in the EU to those Brexiteers who wish to have almost no relationship with the EU in the future.She said: ""Ross was a leading member of the Leave movement in Scotland, and we've got to remember over a million people voted to leave in Scotland, so his views are well known.""But on areas like, for example, ensuring our fishermen get a good deal as we leave, Ross and I are as one.""On so-called 'Dark Money' allegationsMs Davidson confirmed that Richard Cook, who has been at the centre of controversy over a Â£425,000 donation to the Democratic Unionist Party's Brexit campaign, remains a Scottish Conservative member but ""holds no office"".She said the Electoral Commission had already concluded that there was insufficient evidence to investigate allegations that the donation was used to circumvent spending limits for the Leave campaign.She said: ""This donation isn't linked to the Scottish party, it wasn't given to the Scottish party.""It was given to another political party in another country to fight a referendum on the side that the Scottish Conservative leader was fighting against.""Ms Davidson also insisted the Scottish Unionist Association Trust, which donates money to Conservative election campaigns, is registered with the Electoral Commission and that there was ""utter transparency"" about where the money comes from.  She said ""almost all"" Scottish Conservative candidates would have benefitted from the trust, but said she had ""absolutely not"" taken money from it to part-fund a campaign manager as others, including Scottish Secretary David Mundell, have done.

2018-09-14,Gove sorry for attending Paisley dinner,https://web.archive.org//web/20180915024754/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45515428,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove has apologised for attending a dinner hosted last year by Ian Paisley, according to a Conservative councillor. David Harding said Mr Gove was unaware the event in the Tullyglass Hotel was a ""fundraiser"". The Coleraine councillor said he received the personal apology at a meeting in Belfast. The news comes after a second council was criticised for using rate payers money to sponsor a table at the event.  Causeway Coast and Glens Council paid Â£1,500 for the table at last September's event hosted by the DUP's Ian Paisley. It was previously revealed Mid and East Antrim Borough Council had sponsored another table for the same sum.That is now being treated as a ""donation"" to the North Antrim MP by the Electoral Commission.Mr Harding, who is a councillor on the Causeway Coast and Glens Council, said he had met Mr Gove and a special advisor some time after the Tullyglass dinner and he said both apologised to him.""There's a clear instruction from the Conservative Party that members of the government do not attend functions that promote the interests of other parties or raise money for them and it shouldn't happen"" said Mr Harding.""They said they were clear this was a business event, that it wasn't a DUP event, that although it had been arranged by Ian Paisley, this wasn't about raising money for the DUP which it obviously was.""Mr Harding added that he believed Causeway Coast and Glens Council ""genuinely thought it was a business event"".He said the Â£1,500 was ratepayers money and it ""has to be spent well"", but that ""it is the sort of money that can be spent sensibly to promote business in the area"".Mr Harding added: ""I think it's just disgraceful that this event was presented as one thing and was clearly something else.""Causeway Coast and Glens council said the payment was within its guidelines.Councils are not considered ""permissible donors"" and money from such bodies must be returned.In a letter to Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson, Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council said the money was paid directly to the Tullyglass Hotel which hosted the dinner. But Mr Dickson said the payment raises serious questions.""This is public money and we are now talking about two councils spending over Â£3,000 of ratepayers' money for something that was billed - and is all over the local newspapers - as a DUP fundraising event,"" he said. ""A dinner which was held in Ballymena by Ian Paisley MP and indeed was bragged about as a fundraising event by some of his councillors.""The Alliance MLA said he was also concerned about how the decision to sponsor a table was taken.""This wasn't a decision by local councillors, this appears to have been taken entirely by council officers on the basis of a letter they received from an organisation which according to Mid and East Antrim, doesn't even exist, "" he said.In the letter seen by the BBC, the council said the ""spend level for attendance"" at the dinner ""did not require councillors' agreement in accordance with council's procurement policy and specifically the delegated responsibility to officers"".It added ""you will therefore not find a specific council minute which relates to this matter"".In a further statement, it said the keynote speaker at the event was MP Michael Gove and that subjects discussed included Brexit, passenger air tariffs and their impact upon tourism and business travel and the effect of public sector cuts upon rural services. ""Council agreed to attend the event and invite guests who would benefit from both the subject matter and the potential networking opportunities,"" it said. ""Those guests included representatives of our hospitality, food distribution and production, agriculture and leisure industries with an emphasis on the rural aspects of the borough.""The Northern Ireland Auditor's office has confirmed it looked into the payment as part of a wider audit of Causeway Coast and Glens Council and will be making recommendations in the coming weeks.Meanwhile, the Electoral Commission has said it is aware of the payment made by the council, but can't comment any further as its investigation is ongoing.In a statement, Mr Paisley said he was ""content to wait for the outcome of the commission's inquiry"" which he added ""commenced after political rivals made a complaint"". He said his ""annual community and business engagement dinner in Ballymena was very successful and enjoyed by all who attended"".  "

Mr Corbyn's allies have hit back, saying Labour has become a mass movement again under his leadership and there will be no return to the domestic and foreign policies of the New Labour era.In an interview for BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking podcast, Mr McCluskey was asked by its host Nick Robinson what his response would be if Mr Blair decided to renounce his long association with the party.""Well, it wouldn't really make any difference to be honest with you,"" he replied. ""It may actually attract more people towards Labour. ""Tony's obviously a consummate politician. Unfortunately for him, he has become toxic, and the Iraq war and all that went with it. What he's done since then amassing personal fortunes has dented a belief in him.""Jon Lansman, founder of campaign group Momentum, recently suggested Mr Blair was in the wrong party and the achievements attributed to his government - such as the minimum wage and Sure Start children's centres - were the work of others. In the Radio 4 interview, Mr McCluskey also suggested the party's deputy leader, Tom Watson, was in a ""dark place"" and rejected suggestions that he wanted to remove him from his elected post. The two men were friends and political allies, but fell out in 2016 after an unsuccessful revolt by Labour MPs against Mr Corbyn's leadership. Relations worsened after Mr McCluskey claimed his old flatmate tried to ""interfere"" in his re-election bid last year. Labour's deputy leader has since suggested Mr McCluskey and his union allies are ""coming for him"".""I am sorry I've lost Tom's friendship,"" Mr McCluskey said. ""Tom is in, I think, a dark place at the moment. I am not sure he knows personally where he wants to go and what he wants to do.""To be fair to him, he hasn't particularly attacked Jeremy Corbyn since he was part of a coup to remove him which failed miserably. I don't know what Tom's game is.""To be honest, I don't give him much thought and I certainly don't plan to bring him down.""The Political Thinking podcast is available to download or listen to on BBC iPlayer Radio."
2018-09-14,Brexit: Carney makes property crash warning,https://web.archive.org//web/20180915024754/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45516678,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Bank of England's governor has warned the cabinet that a chaotic no-deal Brexit could crash house prices and send another financial shock through the economy.Mark Carney met senior ministers on Thursday to discuss the risks of a disorderly exit from the EU.His worst-case scenario was that house prices could fall as much as 35% over three years, a source told the BBC.The warning echoes some of the Bank's previous comments.The Bank of England routinely carries out ""stress tests"" to check whether the banking system can withstand extreme financial shocks.Its latest one was conducted in November, when it said a 33% fall in house prices could occur in a worst-case scenario. Several reports said that the Bank governor also told the Downing Street meeting that mortgage rates could spiral, the pound could fall and inflation would rise, and countless homeowners could be left in negative equity.Speaking on Friday in Dublin, Mr Carney said the stress test was aimed at making sure the the largest UK banks could continue to meet the needs of the country through ""even through a disorderly Brexit, however unlikely that may be"".""Our job, after all, is not to hope for the best but to plan for the worst,"" he added. Mr Carney, who has just agreed to stay on as governor of the central bank until 2020, has faced strong criticism in the past, with Brexiteers accusing him of being part of the Remain camp.Kamal Ahmed, economics editorIt appears that the Governor wasn't providing the Cabinet with a forecast of what the Bank believes would happen in the event of a no deal Brexit. He was briefing the Cabinet on what preparations the Bank was making if that does happen, including last November's stress test.It was not a forecast. It was an apocalyptic test where the Bank deliberately sets the parameters beyond what might reasonably be expected to occur. The major banks all passed the test, giving reassurance that the financial system can cope with whatever happens next year.The Governor believes that a ""no deal"" scenario would be bad for the economy. But not as bad as the headlines today which are based on a doomsday scenario that is not actually forecast to happen.Read more from Kamal hereIn August, Mr Carney told the BBC that the risk of a no-deal Brexit was ""uncomfortably high"".That comment prompted leading Tory eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg to call Mr Carney ""the high priest of Project Fear"", while former minister Iain Duncan Smith said ""there is no such thing as a no-deal"" and the Bank ""struggled to understand how this would work"".Independent property expert Henry Pryor told the BBC that Mr Carney was ""not predicting Armageddon, he was not predicting house prices would fall by a third, they are just making sure that if, for some extraordinary reason anything was to go horribly wrong, the bank is prepared.""But he warned house prices were likely to fall in the first half of the 2019 as people put off buying amid the Brexit uncertainty, while the number of sellers, ""driven by death, debt and divorce"" would remain about the same. Following the Downing Street meeting, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said ministers remained confident of a Brexit deal, but had agreed to ""ramp up"" their no-deal planning.""As a responsible government, we need to plan for every eventuality. The Cabinet agreed that no-deal remains an unlikely but possible scenario in six months' time,"" the spokesman said.The Bank of England declined to comment.The cabinet meeting was part of a series of no-deal planning sessions designed to discuss the ""unlikely"" scenario that the UK leaves the EU without an agreement in place. After each meeting, planning papers are published on various subjects. On Thursday, the papers disclosed that UK car drivers may have to get an international driving permit if they want to drive in some European countries after a no-deal Brexit.The government said that after March 2019 ""your driving licence may no longer be valid by itself"" in the EU, in its latest no-deal planning papers.The papers also warned that Britons travelling to the EU may need to make sure their passports have six months left to run. And, in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government was trying to give the ""reassurance that consumers need"" on the issue of mobile phone roaming charges but admitted that European operators could pass on charges.He said: ""No, I can't give a cast-iron guarantee. What I can say is that the government would legislate to limit the ability of roaming charges to be imposed on customers."""

""But I had experiences in primary school where it certainly was sufficient at one stage to involve a teacher.""She added: ""Many people will have those experiences and what is good (is) to be able to be open about them, and to come forward about them.""Ms Sturgeon was also asked about her government's record on mental health, with a teenager called Ella saying she had gone to Ms Sturgeon's office in May to give her a ""very personal account of how mental health was affecting young people on Scotland"". She asked: ""If you are as passionate as you say you are about mental health, why did you and your party abstain in the vote for a mental health counsellor in every school after I gave you such an in-depth, personal account?""Opposition parties at Holyrood united in June to back calls for access to a mental health counsellor in every school as part of a motion criticising the government's record on the issue.Ms Sturgeon said her party did not back the move at the time because it could not guarantee it would be delivered, but pointed out that the Scottish government has since put forward an ""ambitious plan to increase the provision of counselling in schools"". The first minister also stressed that she would not stand in the way of a second vote on leaving the European Union.But she was clear she ""would like to be convinced that if there was going to be a second vote Scotland would have an assurance that we don't just end up in the same position all over again"" of Scotland ""being taken in a direction against our will"". One audience member asked why she had had to wait seven months to get specialist treatment for a chronic skin condition, with the first minister saying: ""You shouldn't have had to wait that length of time.""But many of the questions posed by the young people were more light-hearted, with Ms Sturgeon asked about her favourite animal and reality TV programmes.She told the audience she was a ""little bit scared of dogs"", so her favourite animal was the cat, although she added she did not have one as a pet.Questioned on which reality TV show she would appear on, she ruled out appearing on the Great British Bake Off, saying she could not bake, and also said that as she had ""two left feet"" she did not know if Strictly Come Dancing ""would be right for me"".But she stated: ""When I was younger I used to do ice skating quite a lot, so the Dancing On Ice one, I think I quite fancy that.""She insisted that ""I don't think you can taste the difference"" between the original-recipe Irn Bru and its replacement - adding she had discussed this with the chief executive of its manufacturer AG Barr.Asked if more life skills should be taught at school, she said the Scottish government would listen to the views of young people on this, but added: ""Being able to work a cooker is one of these life skills I missed out on when I was younger.""And questioned by one audience member on why children receive so much homework, she said that ""getting the balance right is never an easy task"".Ms Sturgeon also spoke about a possible future career after politics, saying when she was younger being a children's author had been one of her dream jobs.She said: ""When I was a child I either wanted to be a lawyer, which I went on to do, or I wanted to write children's books, which I've not done yet, so who knows, maybe in the future. Those were my dream jobs when I was a child."""

Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson appeared in the chamber with Gabriel on Thursday during a discussion about proxy voting.Speaking to BBC Scotland on Friday morning, she said it had felt like the ""natural thing to do"". Ms Swinson gave birth to Gabriel, her second child, on 29 June. She did not have her 11-week-old son with her when she spoke early on in the debate, before she left the chamber to go and feed Gabriel, who then fell asleep on her in a baby carrier.By convention, Ms Swinson was expected to return to the chamber to listen to the closing speeches in the debate.The East Dunbartonshire MP said: ""The options were: wake him up and hand him to somebody else for 20 minutes, or go in and sit down, do no harm, and he stayed asleep for most of it.""I think it's a step forward for modernising parliament and for sending a message that it really needs to be possible for parents to be able to combine their responsibilities for their children with their working lives, and all too often that is made too difficult.""That won't always mean taking your child to work, but in the case of very small babies, for people who are working at that stage then that can be just one of the ways in which workplaces can modernise and there could be flexibility in order to make it possible.""Earlier in the summer Ms Swinson was ""furious"" when Tory chairman Brandon Lewis - who she was paired with while on parental leave, meaning neither would take part in Commons voting - joined a crunch Brexit vote in July.She said it would not be difficult to introduce a proxy voting system instead, which would allow someone else to vote on behalf of an MP who is on maternity or paternity leave. Ms Swinson added: ""We should take those opportunities to just make it a little bit more possible, because we are talking about parliament that sets the rules for the rest of the country and also therefore can set the tone.""When we've got 54,000 women a year losing their jobs because of pregnancy discrimination it is particularly important that we get these kind of things right because we do need to, not just in parliament but right across the country, modernise workplaces so that it is more possible for parents to balance their responsibilities."""

He also urged the SNP to ""come off the fence"" on a second EU referendum.In an interview with BBC Scotland, Sir Vince - whose party wants to stop Brexit happening - said momentum for a so-called ""people's vote"" on the final deal between the UK and EU was building.He said: ""I think it's very clear that people in Scotland, as in other parts of the United Kingdom, don't want Brexit to happen.""They want to stop it and it can be stopped, and the best mechanism for stopping it is to have a people's vote. I think momentum is building up behind that and I'm trying to work with people in other parties to make sure it happens.""The Lib Dems and SNP share a common goal of keeping the UK in both the single market and customs union - but Nicola Sturgeon has not yet endorsed holding a second vote on Brexit. Sir Vince said he had been working closely with the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and hoped to ""persuade them to support us"" over efforts to stop Brexit happening. He added: ""We would like the SNP to come off the fence on the people's vote because this is absolutely crucial and they haven't got there yet.""With regard to a possible second vote on Scottish independence, Mr Cable said Scotland's desire to remain in the UK had been determined by the 2014 referendum.But he said: ""If there ever were in future a referendum on Scottish independence and people voted for it, I think they would themselves have to accept that there should then be a confirmatory vote at the end.""That would be the way referendums are conducted in places like Switzerland, which use these things commonly. ""So I don't think there's any inconsistency with supporting us on the principle of having a people's vote on Europe.""Sir Vince was speaking ahead of the Liberal Democrat conference, which will be held in Brighton over the weekend."

Meanwhile, the Bank of England governor told the cabinet house prices could drop 35% in three years without a deal.Mark Carney presented cabinet ministers with a range of scenarios under which prices would fall if the UK and EU do not reach a deal. A cabinet source confirmed that he said the Bank of England was prepared for a worst-case scenario where house prices could go down by as much as 35% over three years.In an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government was trying to give the ""reassurance that consumers need"" on the issue of mobile phone roaming charges but admitted that European operators could pass on charges.He said: ""No, I can't give a cast-iron guarantee. What I can say is that the government would legislate to limit the ability of roaming charges to be imposed on customers."" The government has published its latest contingency plans in the event of a no-deal Brexit. On mobile phone charges, the document says that ""in the unlikely event"" of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, consumers should ""check the roaming policies of your mobile operator before you go abroad"". The main points include:Mr Raab told Laura Kuenssberg Cabinet ministers earlier spent three hours examining ""all the plans across government to make sure we can manage, mitigate or avoid the risk of a no-deal scenario"".He also said there must be a ""shift across the board in the EU's approach"" on the issue of Northern Ireland: ""They will have to meet us halfway... if they meet the ambition, the pragmatism we've shown through our White Paper proposals then I'm confident we can get a good deal for this country, but also for the EU.""Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The only reason the government is talking about no-deal is because the Tory civil war on Europe prevents the prime minister from negotiating a good deal.""With the clock ticking, ministers should drop the irresponsible rhetoric and start putting jobs and the economy first.""Extra charges for people using their phones in another EU country were scrapped in June 2017. But the EU regulation banning them will not automatically be part of UK law after Brexit on 29 March next year.In theory this means UK mobile operators, if they want to, could reintroduce the charges that could make it expensive to use a mobile phone in another EU country.However, the government said it would legislate to make operators set a cap of Â£45 a month on data usage while abroad - in line with the current EU limit of â¬50.Mr Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme two mobile operators, Vodafone and Three, had publicly agreed not to bring back roaming charges for British citizens.The government was aiming to get a Brexit deal with Brussels by mid-November at the latest but was stepping up contingency planning in case that did not happen, he added.He said one of the consequences of a ""no deal"" Brexit ""is that obviously we wouldn't pay out the money that has been agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement"".The UK would ""recognise our strict legal obligations"" but that the amount paid would be ""significantly, substantially lower"" than the Â£39bn agreed with the EU.Analysis by BBC Political Correspondent Laura KuenssbergMinisters believe the chances of there being no agreement are now relatively small. They are hopeful that next week EU leaders will give helpful hints at a special meeting in Salzburg. Yet there is a long way to go until Dominic Raab, or anyone in government, can be sure. And don't doubt that many Tory MPs are adamant they simply won't vote for the kind of proposal Theresa May has put on the table. A senior EU diplomatic source told BBC News Mr Raab's divorce bill comments were ""a statement of the obvious"" as the financial settlement was part of the withdrawal agreement. ""The [EU27] will keep our heads cool as we always do,"" he added.Business leaders have repeatedly warned about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal, with the CBI saying the UK would face tariffs on 90% of its EU exports and a number of new regulatory hurdles.UK consumers could find going on holiday and making card payments for EU products more expensive because Britain would no longer be part of the EU's payments process.CBI Director General Carolyn Fairbairn said the government's latest planning papers ""make clear firms would be hit with a sledgehammer in the event of no-deal"". ""They also illustrate the extent of the disruption consumers can expect if ideology wins over evidence."" There are also concerns about delays at the UK border.The Road Haulage Association has warned it will take ""an average of about 45 minutes to process one truck on both sides of the channel"" if customs checks are put in place. ""If that happens then the queues of HGVs in Kent will make the jams seen in the summer of 2015 appear as little more than waiting for the traffic lights to change,"" it adds.Mr Raab said there was a risk of disruption at the border if the EU did not respond ""with the collaborative spirit"" he said the UK ""would want to show"".The UK government was planning contra-flow systems on the M20 and was talking to EU member states about ""mitigating"" potential disruption. And he took a swipe at businesses, such as John Lewis, saying: ""I think it's probably rather easy at this moment in time for any business that isn't doing rather well to point to Brexit.""Please upgrade your browserLast month the government published 24 no-deal documents covering industries including medicine, finance and farming. There were warnings of extra paperwork at borders and extra credit card charges for Britons visiting the EU.More no-deal publications are expected in the coming weeks.Labour MP Ian Murray, a member of the campaign for another referendum, said: ""Nobody voted to make Britain poorer, to diminish our national influence or to ruin their holidays. ""The government has no mandate for any of this and it's too big an issue to be left to a Brexit elite in Westminster. That is why we must have a people's vote on the final Brexit deal."" "

Then, many in the party felt that the existing top brass had passed their best, and the Conservatives needed fresh thinking and leadership. The slogan may have baggage, but more than a decade later, that question rather sums up why the suggestion from former minister George Freeman, on Thursday evening, that Theresa May should move on after March, can't be easily ignored. Very few Tory MPs want to say it publicly, but if they asked each other, ""Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"" many of them would confess, and admit privately in conversation that once the Brexit deal is done and we have left the EU in the spring, then Theresa May should make clear her intention not to fight the next election at a minimum.  Many believe that she should depart, or say that she is off almost immediately after that moment. Mr Freeman is not trying to push her out now and was effusive in praise for how she's managed so far. But his comments underline a widespread private assumption shared by many MPs and some ministers too - which of course may turn out to be wrong - that once the tortuous process of getting out of the EU is done, the best hope for the Tories of turning the page on the whole saga, is a new face at the helm. One senior MP, who is trying their best, for now, to keep the very rocky show on the road and who knows Theresa May well and has advised her many times told me: ""In March she's gone. Either she will have to set that out or people like me will tell her she has to go. ""If she doesn't say she's off, the letters will go in, and that will be it, so we can move on.""Some of the ministers seeking to make their mark have notions that they have a few months to do that before a potential contest. Remember, one of the big reasons that there hasn't been a leadership contest so far is that no wannabe wanted to take on the problems of Brexit. Once we have actually left, while many decisions and complexities will linger, the UK will have actually left, which should, in theory at least, create a space to change the political conversation. This is not about a handful of Brexiteers agitating to shove her out rudely because they don't like the direction of travel for the next few months. It's not about saying that there will be a sudden schism and they will crash into a leadership contest. But it's about a general sense across different wings of the Conservative Party, that Theresa May's time and political energy will have been run down by Brexit. Hold on for a minute. Politics is a rollercoaster - of course this is not inevitable. One government minister was furious this week when I asked about the very assumption that Mrs May could have less than a year in office, lambasting colleagues for discussing the subject, practically claiming that it's not a genuine topic of conversation. Another of her Cabinet allies told me tonight that ""if she delivers a good Brexit deal and the country is still moving forward, then Theresa May will still find herself in a very good position"", with the potential of leading the country and staying on for years to come. Certainly, time after time Theresa May has surprised and defied those who've tried to tear her down. What is the case though, is that many Tories have already made their minds up, that her time will be up within the next year. And in articulating his view publicly, Mr Freeman is saying what huge numbers of his colleagues have been thinking too. "
2018-09-14,'Not a forecast',https://web.archive.org//web/20180915024754/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45519309,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Governor of the Bank of England has always been clear about two things.That the present Brexit process has had negative effects on the broader economy and on people's incomes.And that a Brexit deal where there is no formal agreement between Britain and the European Union would make those effects worse.As Mark Carney said to me in an interview earlier this week to mark the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis, Brexit is one of the Big Four risks the Bank is facing.A debt crisis in China, problematically high household debt in the UK and a catastrophic cyber-attack taking out a whole bank are the others.""There are risks around Brexit for the financial sector,"" he told me.""And here's something that's changed with the system from 10 years ago - we are absolutely upfront about those risks, our view of those risks.""We have stress tested our banks against those risks to make sure they have enough of a safety net, both in terms of their own funds plus liquid funds, in case we had a no deal Brexit.""The key phrase is ""stress tested"".The Bank's Financial Policy Committee regularly sets ""doomsday scenarios"" to test the banking system's robustness in the face of a significant shock.The last stress test in November involved a scenario where house prices fell by 33%, interest rates rose to 4% and unemployment doubled.It became known as the ""no deal test"" and is remarkably close to the headlines we are seeing this morning.It appears that the Governor wasn't providing the Cabinet with a forecast of what the Bank believes would happen in the event of a no deal Brexit.He was briefing the Cabinet on what preparations the Bank was making if that does happen, including last November's stress test.It was not a forecast. It was an apocalyptic test where the Bank deliberately sets the parameters beyond what might reasonably be expected to occur.The major banks all passed the test, giving reassurance that the financial system can cope with whatever happens next year.The Governor believes that a ""no deal"" scenario would be bad for the economy.But not as bad as the headlines today which are based on a doomsday scenario that is not actually forecast to happen.There is another point that is often lost in the loudness of the negative headlines.If there is a ""good deal"" with the EU, Mr Carney believes there could be a significant boost to the economy as pent-up demand held back by the present uncertainty is released.Investment could rise markedly, he has argued.Those are the options as he sees them, and it is up to the politicians on both sides of the negotiation to come to a decision on which route they take."
2018-09-14,No-deal preparations,https://web.archive.org//web/20180915024754/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45514495,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA lot of hassle and potential cost for a lot of people. The government's spent the afternoon giving details of what might need to happen, if there was no deal with the EU.There's no guarantee you'd be able to avoid big phone bills if you use your mobile abroad, although ministers say they'd cap any data charges at Â£45 a month and some of the firms say they won't change prices. If you want to go on the road on the continent, you might need an International Driving Permit. If you want to jump on a cheap flight for a last-minute weekend, better check you have six months left on your passport, or you might be turned back.If there isn't a deal, many products tested in the UK after Brexit will have to go through the same process again - but with an EU authority in charge. The list of what might have to happen is a very long one. And some of the trickiest implications, like what would happen to planes flying between European and British skies, haven't even been published yet. And as the French foreign minister suggested, the Eurostar might not be able to run, and yes, planes may not be able to fly if a resolution can't be found. Publishing the papers are part of the government's plan to look like they are prepared for the potential shock and disruption of the negotiations failing. And indeed, for some in government, publicly detailing those preparations is part of a tactic to suggest that they have a way out and are ready to walk away, if Brussels doesn't budge. What ministers won't say, however, is how much money we might have to pay the EU if there were to be no deal. The Brexit secretary and the prime minister have both repeatedly said that the estimated price tag of nearly Â£40bn if there is a deal would not be paid in full. But they refuse point blank to give an assessment of how much it would be, if we walked away without an agreement. The reality is the cost would probably still be many billions, and it would take lawyers many, many years to be able to agree on it. In that situation, the government would be walking away without being able to tell MPs or the public how much we would still have to stump up. Ministers' belief, however, is that the chances of there being no agreement are now relatively small. They are hopeful that next week EU leaders will give helpful hints at a special meeting in Salzburg. On Thursday, the Brexit secretary told me he believes the EU will meet the UK ""half way"" on the Irish border issue, which for many many months has been the trickiest issue of all.Yet there is a long way to go until he, or anyone in government, can be sure. And don't doubt that many Tory MPs are adamant they simply won't vote for the kind of proposal Theresa May has put on the table. One senior MP told me: ""If people in Number 10 haven't made clear to her that 'Chequers minus minus' isn't going to get through the Commons, then she is getting the wrong advice."" After all, there are two kinds of ""no deal"" - one seems very unlikely, where the EU and the UK simply can't agree. The prime minister comes back to Parliament and says: ""I'm sorry, I tried, but it just won't wash.""But the other is that Theresa May comes back with a deal but her party, and Parliament, chucks it out. The political climate would be different in those two cases. But in the potential chaos of either, the hassle outlined on Thursday might just be the start. "

There is massive frustration with her leadership, her position on Chequers and the way her proposals tuck the UK closely into the EU in perpetuity. And yes, there are some MPs who want to see her gone immediately. However senior voices in the European Research Group - yes them - are adamant that it is not the time to try to oust the PM. It would be ""stupid"", one told me last night. Imagine in these critical weeks of the Brexit negotiations if the UK started to try to change the prime minister. Right now those jostling to remove her know they don't have any guarantees they would have the numbers to force her out, even though they may well be able to pull together enough MPs to submit letters to the chair of 1922 committee to trigger a contest.So are the Eurosceptics coldly gaming the options for how to get their way? Does that include discussing if, when and how, they could try to push the prime minister out of office? Absolutely. But does it mean we are on the verge of a coup being launched against Number 10? Things can change very fast these days. But don't be so sure."
2018-09-14,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180915024754/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45488124,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA group of Tory MPs has endorsed a plan for a ""clean break"" from the European Union (EU), with the UK defaulting to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules when it leaves the EU. The proposals are contained in a report by the pressure group Economists for Free Trade (EFT). Here's an initial look at a few of the claims they've made. These figures are based on a number of calculations and assumptions, not all of which stand up to scrutiny. Those who have modelled a clean Brexit properly, the EFT asserts, report long-term gains from free trade of 2%-4% of GDP. The report dismisses alternative modelling - done by the Treasury and by Whitehall's Cross Departmental Brexit Analysis - which arrived at very different conclusions. But that is part of the problem. The EFT are convinced that they are the only people who have modelled the data correctly - even though theirs is a minority view.""The vast majority of economists think it will be different,"" says Prof Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex.""Because a hard Brexit will cut trade with the EU, which is by far our largest trading partner, significantly.""Chequers plan 'worse than status quo'What is the 'no deal' WTO option?Last year the UK exported almost Â£274bn in goods and services to the EU, compared with Â£112bn to the US. When it comes to imports, the UK imported Â£341bn in goods and services from the EU and Â£70bn from the US.  For those who love the detail, here is one example of economists who criticise the EFT's methodology. Tory supporters of Brexit are, however, unbowed: ""Perhaps it's our fault,"" says leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, ""by not putting the argument for a world trade deal earlier, we left the running to people who don't want us to leave the EU at all.""The EFT report also says the UK would no longer have to pay a net amount of Â£12bn to the EU every year, although that figure appears to be slightly inflated.According to the Treasury net payments to the EU amounted to Â£9.6bn in 2016 and Â£8.9bn in 2017. Forecasts over the next five years suggest that - if the UK were to stay in the EU - net payments to the EU would rise to roughly Â£11bn a year.The EFT report goes on to  suggests that the UK could choose to withhold ""most or all"" of the estimated Â£39bn financial settlement that the government has provisionally agreed to pay the EU as part of a Withdrawal Agreement. In theory, the UK could do that, but it would probably prompt a legal challenge from the EU, and it would certainly damage relations severely at a time when - as the EFT report suggests - the government would be looking for co-operation in a whole series of policy areas. It says only 4% of goods arriving in the UK from non-EU countries are subject to checks, and it suggests that trade with the EU in future could therefore be almost as seamless as it is now.  It's correct that very few physical or documentary checks are carried out on non-EU goods. But evidence given to the Home Affairs Select Committee suggests that things are rather more complicated than that. If a lorry arrives at Dover, for example, from a non-EU country, it is usually delayed by 60 to 90 minutes even if no checks are made. The UK could choose to speed up that process and abolish many checks, but there would still be far more checks on UK goods being exported to the EU via Dover. There would also be further complications for UK exports. Once the UK is designated as a third country by the EU, all UK exports of animal origin would only be able to enter EU territory via a veterinary border inspection post, where there are often time-consuming physical inspections as well as documentary checks. Neither the Eurotunnel nor the Calais port is currently designated as a veterinary border inspection post. The EFT report says that under WTO rules sanitary and phytosanitary measures (ie safety checks on food) can't be used as a ""surreptitious means of inhibiting cross-border trade"". This is true, but that does not erase what are known as non-tariff-barriers entirely, it simply reduces inspections where possible. ""The only countries that have managed to remove the need for health checks on food being exported to the EU,"" says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform, ""are the European Economic Area members and Switzerland. They have not only implemented EU rules in this area domestically, they also apply EU checks on all imports of animal origin entering from the rest of the world."" The EFT report also suggests lifting tariffs (or import charges) on imported goods to make prices cheaper. It recognises that if you do that for one country, you have to do it for every country, under WTO rules. If tariffs were removed for all agricultural produce, cheap imports would flood in and food prices would fall - but the UK farming industry could be decimated. So, the report says, that ""perhaps the most attractive goods to target"" might be ones that we don't produce in the UK at all. It mentions oranges as one example, but it would be a pretty limited number of goods.  Again, others are extremely sceptical about the EFT's policy proposals. According to a report published earlier this year by the House of Lords European Union Committee, ""EU food imports cannot easily be replaced by either producing more in the UK or importing more from non-EU countries"". The Lords report forecast that food prices were likely to rise without a Brexit deal. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.3%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-14,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180915024754/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

This debate is about the future of the people of the UK and the future of the United Kingdom. ""That's what I'm focused on and that's what we should all be focused on.  ""It's ensuring that we get that good deal from the European Union which is good for people in the UK, wherever they live in the UK, that's what's important for us.""Analysis by Chris Mason, political correspondentAfter a week in which the prime minister was politically duffed up by one set of her MPs openly plotting to oust her, and by another set meeting in public to discuss how to derail her blueprint for Brexit, this is Theresa May's response.A few things stood out for me; her willingness, again, to embrace what was meant to be an unflattering description of her - by Conservative colleague Ken Clarke - that she was a ""bloody difficult woman"", and laugh about it.There was also her absolute insistence that her Brexit plan is the only one in town and she is sticking to it.And finally the cold contempt, visible in her eyes, with which she addresses Boris Johnson's description of her Brexit blueprint as being akin to a ""suicide vest"" being placed around the country.Please upgrade your browserRead the full glossary here As part of the so-called Chequers plan, Mrs May said she wants to strike a trade deal with the EU for after the UK leaves in 2019.She also said there needs to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland, in order to avoid a hard border there.The UK and EU are hoping to agree a way forward next month, at the same time as they settle the terms of the UK's withdrawal, including a transition period up to the end of 2020.Mrs May's proposals are unpopular with many Tory MPs, who argue it would compromise the UK's sovereignty.Boris Johnson, who has been at odds with Mrs May's vision for Brexit for some time, claimed last week that she had ""wrapped a suicide vest"" around the British constitution and ""handed the detonator"" to Brussels.Mrs May said: ""I was home secretary for six years, and as prime minister for two years now I think using language like that was not right and it's not language I would have used.""We voted in 2016 â why is it taking so long to leave?Well, none of the major players has ever left the European Union before...So there are some BIG problems to solveSuch as how we donât end up worse-off economicallyThe EU has a ""single market"" - goods from other EU countries aren't taxed at the borderAnd people can also move around as if the EU was a single countryOutside the EU, the UK might have to pay more to buy from and sell to EU countriesThis could also slow the flow of goods and parts, disrupting production for UK firmsThe EU says Britain canât cherry pick â keeping some benefits without membershipBut that could mean the UK is freer to make other trade deals around the worldAny special deal the UK wants has to be approved by MPs firstThen the deal has to be agreed by 27 national parliaments across EuropeThatâs a lot of people who need to agree with each otherâ¦So, the date UK is meant to leave is 29 March 2019But there are already plans for a 21-month transition period after thatDuring which the UK could still be governed by some EU lawsA trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to agreeHowever, as the UKâs already fully aligned with the EU, it could be quickerBut it is likely that we will all be talking about Brexit for a long time yet...Click next arrow to proceedLoading ...Swipe to progress(If you can't see the explainer, follow this link)The prime minister also said the ""bloody difficult woman"" - a description which was used to describe her by former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke - was ""still there"".But, she added, ""there's a difference between those who think you can only be bloody difficult in public, and those who think actually you bide your time, and you're bloody difficult when the time is right - and when it really matters"".BBC Panorama, Inside No 10: Deal or No Deal? is on Monday 17 September at 20:30 BST on BBC One as part of a week on in-depth coverage across the BBC to mark Brexit: Six Months to Go."

He said he had never expected to back calls for a second referendum, but had become ""increasingly alarmed as the chaotic approach to the negotiations had become mired in confusion and deadlock"".With time running out for the British government to negotiate a final deal with the EU before March 2019, Mr Khan said the UK was left with two ""incredibly risky"" possibilities.""Both these scenarios are a million miles from what was promised during the referendum campaign, only further exposing the lies and mistruths sold to the public,"" he wrote in the paper.""I don't believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people's livelihoods.""Appearing on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Khan was shown comments he made to LBC radio after the Brexit referendum, in which he warned a fresh poll would lead to ""even more cynicism"" among voters.He told Marr: ""It's really important that this is not a re-run of the referendum but the British public having a say for the first time on the outcome."" Pushed on what voters should be asked in a fresh vote, he said it should be a choice between the government's deal and remaining in the EU.Asked whether that would disenfranchise supporters of a hard Brexit, Mr Khan added: ""My point is this. Rather than having a bad deal or a no deal, let's put that to the British public with the option of staying in the EU.""Mr Khan also dismissed suggestions he was trying to distract from his track record as London mayor, following criticisms of his record on knife crime, housing and transport.Appearing on the same programme, Environment Secretary Mr Gove, a leading Brexiteer during the referendum, said Mr Khan's comments were ""troubling"".""People voted clearly - 17.4m people - to leave the European Union,"" Mr Gove said. ""Sadiq is essentially saying, 'Stop, lets delay the process, let's throw it into chaos'. And I think that would be a profound mistake.""Earlier this month, Prime Minister Theresa May said the government would not back another vote.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, she said: ""To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy - and a betrayal of that trust.""Please upgrade your browserMeanwhile, in a letter to Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, published by The Sunday Times, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer warned the government that Labour MPs will vote down attempts to force the country into a ""blind Brexit"".It comes as the People's Vote campaign, which wants a new referendum on Brexit, is attempting to change Labour Party policy, according to a leaked memo.Earlier this month GMB general secretary Tim Roache said the union backed a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, urging Labour to ""follow suit"".

2018-09-15,'Broken' rail system to be reviewed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180916021644/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45532566,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA review of the rail industry is to be launched by the government next week, following criticism of the way the franchising model is run.Labour said the model was ""broken"", after the East Coast Mainline franchise failed for the third time and passengers on other lines faced strikes and disruption to new timetables. The party says it will renationalise the railways if it gets into power.But the government says privatisation has helped ""transform"" the industry.The UK's rail network has been beset by problems, with the East Coast Mainline brought back under government control in May - for the third time in a decade.Meanwhile, members of the RMT union are holding the latest in a series of 24-hour strikes on Northern and South Western in a long-running dispute over the role of guards on trains. Hundreds of rail services are likely to be cancelled and replacement buses will operate on some routes.The review, to be announced on Thursday, is expected to be led by Keith Williams, the deputy chairman of department store John Lewis.It is likely to examine how issues such as those faced by the East Coast Mainline can be avoided in the future. The franchise was a joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin Trains.This week the Transport Select Committee described the bid to run the line as ""naive"" and said the DfT must take the blame for not managing it effectively.The DfT plans to run the service as the London North Eastern Railway until a new public-private partnership can be appointed in 2020.The government first began to offer Britain's passenger train services to the private sector to run on a franchised basis in the 1990s.Transport secretary Chris Grayling has also faced questions over his handling of the disruption faced by passengers on Thameslink and Great Northern trains this year, following the introduction of new timetables by owner Govia Thameslink. The Office of Rail and Road has launched an inquiry into the problems.Labour has said it would bring the railways back under public ownership if it was in power.Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald said: ""Long-suffering rail passengers don't need a review to explain to them that the franchising system is broken beyond repair. ""No amount of tinkering will change the fact that rail franchising has failed, does not deliver and never will."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""Privatisation has helped transform our railway, doubling passenger numbers and delivering more services, extra investment and new trains.""We are absolutely committed to improving journeys and are always examining ways to improve how the railway serves passengers.""Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group which represents the rail industry, said the public and private sectors had achieved a lot working together over the last 20 years but ""the time is right for root and branch reform""."

It says it has also significantly stepped up efforts to seize dirty Russian money coming into the UK. It has also launched investigations into British-based lawyers and accountants suspected of facilitating money laundering.The NCA leads the UK fight against money laundering and criminal money, which it estimates could be worth up to Â£1bn a day. A number of its investigations have led it to offshore firms registered in the Cayman Islands, which is a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean and one of the world's largest financial centres.Donald Toon, director of the NCA, revealed the Cayman Islands authorities had not co-operated when he had asked for information on who owned these firms.He said that usually when his officers asked British Overseas Territories for help ""we can generally get from them clear, unambiguous beneficial ownership information but we are having a difficulty with Cayman"".""The Cayman government is entirely aware of the UK concerns,"" he said.In recent years the spotlight has been on tax havens linked to the UK following a series of global investigations involving nearly 100 media organisations, including the BBC. The Paradise Papers exposed how wealthy and corrupt individuals used complex offshore structures to cover their tracks. The NCA said there were now signs that criminals were finding new tax havens where they could exploit lax regulation and hide their links to corrupt assets.These were jurisdictions ""well beyond the British Overseas Territories"". Mr Toon called them ""small island nations"" where ""people are able to register companies but are much more difficult to penetrate in terms of getting access to the information"" on beneficial owners. He did not say where. Mr Toon also said the NCA had significantly stepped up its work to identify and seize corrupt Russian assets in the UK - but it was yet to use new powers, known as Unexplained Wealth Orders, against them. Unexplained Wealth Orders, which came into force on 31 January, force wealthy people to explain the source of their assets if there is reason to suspect corruption.""This is not quick work,"" Mr Toon explained, because rich criminals are experts at hiding their ownership of corrupt assets. He revealed there were ""a couple of dozen"" active investigations into lawyers and accountants suspected of facilitating the flow of dirty money into the UK which he described as the ""lifeblood of nearly all organised crime"". Asked if he was concerned that dirty money was being used to fund the private education of the children of corrupt oligarchs, Mr Toon said those private schools with charitable status have to carry out due diligence. However, he said they rarely issue alerts to law enforcement."
2018-09-15,Reform of 'archaic' divorce laws revealed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180916021644/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45525979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMore details have emerged about government plans to overhaul ""archaic"" divorce laws in England and Wales.Couples wishing to divorce could soon benefit from a less confrontational process, under proposals confirmed by the Justice Secretary David Gauke. The government has launched a consultation proposing removing the need to allege ""fault"", and the right of spouses to contest a divorce.Mr Gauke said the current divorce laws were ""out of touch with modern life"".Under the current law, unless people can prove their marriage has broken down due to adultery, unreasonable behaviour or desertion, the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's consent is to live apart for five years.If the separation is mutual, the couple have to prove they have been separated for a minimum of two years before they can divorce.Mr Guake said: ""We think that the blame game that currently exists helps nobody. It creates unnecessary antagonism and anxiety at an already trying time for couples.""The proposed changes, which were leaked earlier this month, include making ""the irretrievable breakdown of a marriage"" the sole grounds for a divorce.It is also recommending removing the need to show evidence of a spouse's conduct, or a period of living apart. The 12-week consultation also proposes a new notification process where one, or possibly both parties, can simply notify the court of their intention to divorce, removing the opportunity for the other spouse to contest the divorce application.The changes would apply to both marriages and civil partnerships.Pressure for reform intensified after a woman's appeal for divorce was rejected by the Supreme Court in July due to her husband's refusal to split.Tini Owens, 68, wanted to divorce on the grounds she was unhappy but her husband of 40 years refused the split, leading the court to rule against her ""with reluctance"". That meant she must remain married until 2020 - as currently the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's agreement is to live apart for five years. Mr Gauke said the case had ""generated broader questions about what the law requires of people going through divorce and what it achieves in practice"". There had been a ""growing coalition recognising that the animosity that is put into this system is one that is not doing us any good,"" he said.Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon had previously urged the government to simply change the law rather than undertaking a consultation.Hannah Cornish, head of family law at Slater and Gordon, said there was a ""desperate need"" for reform.She added: ""Having to place blame can really inflame matters at what can already be a stressful and difficult time for a family.""Ministers also want views on the minimum time between the interim and final divorce decree in order to allow couples time to reflect and reach agreement on arrangements for the future if divorce is inevitable.  When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following five reasons:Source: Gov.UK"

On the first day of their four-day conference in Brighton, the Lib Dems will discuss the Windrush scandal, animal welfare and decentralisation among other issues.But the event is likely to be dominated by questions over the party's future direction, after Sir Vince - who will make his keynote speech on Tuesday - called for a major overhaul of its membership and election rules to counter claims it lacked popular appeal and was struggling to be heard. His proposals, which are likely to be debated but not voted on at this year's event, could allow people to join the party for free and non-members to vote in future leadership elections. Most controversially, he has floated the idea of future leadership contests being opened up to people who are not MPs. The party currently has 12 MPs and Sir Vince was elected unopposed last year.He told the Press Association that his party - which backs a referendum on the final Brexit deal - could provide a home to those ""fed up with the extremes of the current Conservative and Labour parties"".""Whether you see yourself as a liberal, social democrat, progressive, or centrist there is a home for you here, particularly as we fight Brexit together,"" he said.""I have made proposals to open up our movement to become an even more powerful force at the centre of British politics, standing up to power and privilege to bring fairness and opportunity for everyone.""The party said 10,000 people had pre-registered their interest to become party members since Sir Vince announced the proposals earlier this month.

2018-09-15,Brexit vote watchdog 'got law wrong',https://web.archive.org//web/20180916021644/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45519676,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Electoral Commission misinterpreted EU referendum spending laws allowing Vote Leave to break them, the High Court has ruled.Vote Leave paid Â£625,000 to clear bills allegedly run up by university student Darren Grimes.The watchdog initially said it had no grounds to suspect this was a scheme to get round spending limits.It later changed its mind and fined Vote Leave and Mr Grimes - and also referred him to the police.The High Court agreed with the Electoral Commission finding in July that Vote Leave had broken the law, but said the watchdog had misinterpreted the rules, in the run-up to the June 2016 referendum, in advice it gave to the Leave campaign.Vote Leave's former chief executive Matthew Elliott said that if the Electoral Commission did not launch an appeal against the ruling it would be admitting it had given incorrect advice and should drop its fines.Anti-Brexit campaigner and Labour peer Lord Adonis said: ""It sounds to me as if the Electoral Commission has not been doing its job properly. On the face of it, it seems to have been extremely incompetent.""He told the BBC's Politics Live that if there was another EU referendum, which he wants to see, ""we need a rather more fit and proper body to be in charge of it"".The Electoral Commission said the High Court ""arrived at the same conclusion as the Commission did in its investigation - that Vote Leave should have accounted for the expenditure on the digital services firm, AggregateIQ - although it found an additional reason for reaching that conclusion"". The Commission's chief executive Claire Bassett said: ""The High Court has not ruled on the advice we gave to Vote Leave. Our advice was generic and covered hypothetical scenarios. ""At no point did we give any advice or discuss payments to Aggregate IQ. ""Suggestions made otherwise today on social media are categorically untrue.  ""Put simply, today's ruling states that donations from one campaign group to another are lawful, but that those donations must be declared as expenditure by the person or campaign group making the donation, if it is for a specific purpose. This is something that Vote Leave did not do.""In his judgement, Lord Justice Leggatt said the Electoral Commission had ""misinterpreted the definition of 'referendum expenses'"" as defined by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendum Act.He added: ""The source of its error is a mistaken assumption that an individual or body which makes a donation to a permitted participant cannot thereby incur referendum expenses.  ""As a result of this error, the Electoral Commission has interpreted the definition in a way that is inconsistent with both the language and the purpose of the legislation.""Vote Leave's donation to Mr Grimes, which went straight to its Canadian digital agency AggregateIQ, should have counted as part of Vote Leave's campaign expenses, added the judge. ""The position would have been different if the money had been given to Mr Grimes for him to use however he chose in promoting a 'leave' outcome of the referendum,"" he added.But the judge said there was no ""rational basis"" for the watchdog's actions, which he described a ""recipe for abuse"" of the law.Jolyon Maugham QC of the Good Law Project, which brought the High Court challenge, said the ruling proved the watchdog ""unlawfully tilted the playing field in favour of Leave"" in the 2016 referendum.""Stronger In (the official Remain campaign) was also up against its spending limits. ""But because it didn't get the advice from the Electoral Commission it had to stop spending. And the High Court decided that advice was wrong.""He said ""heads should roll"" at the Electoral Commission over the error.Matthew Elliott, former chief executive of Vote Leave, said the High Court ruling had ""thrown electoral law for future elections and referendums into total chaos"". ""Either the Electoral Commission is wrong or the High Court is wrong. ""Should the Electoral Commission choose not to appeal this judgment, they will be admitting that they gave Vote Leave incorrect advice and they should immediately reconsider the unfair fines they are seeking to impose on us,"" he added.""Vote Leave would not have made the donations that it did, had it not been for the Commission's clear advice. ""This whole situation is a mess of the Electoral Commission's own making, and their defeat in the High Court today must force a rethink. ""They now have a chance to rectify their errors. They should do the right thing.""  "
2018-09-15,I'll stand for leader if asked - Tory MP,https://web.archive.org//web/20180916021644/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45519604,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMP George Freeman has said he will put his name forward to be the next Tory leader if ""asked to"" amid continuing speculation over Theresa May's future.It comes after the ex-minister, who once chaired Mrs May's policy board, said there should be leadership contest next summer after Brexit was settled. He said he was ""no Michael Heseltine"" and would ""stand back"" if top figures from the ""next generation"" emerged.Mrs May has said she will serve as long as her party wants her to.Michael, now Lord, Heseltine launched a Conservative leadership challenge to Margaret Thatcher in 1990, triggering a contest won by John Major, after Lady Thatcher resigned as PM.Earlier this week, pro-Brexit MPs unhappy with Theresa May's Chequers blueprint for future co-operation with the EU openly discussed her future. This led to a backlash from senior figures such as Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith, who described leadership speculation as ""loose talk"" that should be stamped upon.  Downing Street has insisted there is no vacancy and the PM is focused on delivering the best outcome for the UK as it prepares to leave the EU this Spring. Negotiations on the terms of the UK's exit are entering their final stages, with both sides hoping for an agreement by the start of November at the latest.The UK and EU want to agree an outline statement on their future relations at the same time. By BBC political correspondent Jonathan BlakeIf you're thinking ""should I know who this guy is?"", don't worry, the answer - unless you're a keen Westminster watcher - is no. As George Freeman himself said - ""If I was still advising Theresa May..."" - which of course he isn't, having resigned as the chair of her policy board in November last year. But should the prime minister be worried? It's hard to ignore the fact that an MP has pointedly said in public that it is time for their leader to set a date for their departure. And this week others were slapped down by senior colleagues for expressing their frustration with Theresa May's leadership over Brexit. But if George Freeman has an organised campaign of supporters in Parliament, which he would need to be a serious contender, he is keeping it very well hidden. He also qualified his own leadership intention with the use of that key two letter word 'if' - ""If people want me to in Parliament, I will,"" he said. As one MP put it; ""I can't imagine who would ask him."" Ouch. But Tories who back a Canada-style trade deal with the EU have threatened to block the PM's Chequers plan, which proposes a much closer relationship, when the issue is voted on in Parliament in the autumn. Mr Freeman, who voted Remain in the 2016 referendum and was seen as ally of former leader David Cameron, quit as Mrs May's policy adviser in November last year over concerns about the direction of the party.He told BBC Radio Norfolk it should be up to a new leader to decide the UK's future relationship with the EU.The Mid-Norfolk MP said there should be a leadership contest next summer, lasting no more than three months, to determine the party's future direction, and he was prepared to throw his hat into the ring.""If the question is 'will I stand, the answer is if people want me to in Parliament, I will.""The next leader, he said, should come from the new crop of Tory politicians elected since 2010 - ""not the old faces"" as he described them - at least 10 of whom he suggested could do the job.""I would like to see the whole range of candidates stand. I would like a democratic Conservative Party choose the right leader. I'd like to see the nation see the breadth of talent we have"". But Mr Freeman indicated that he would not challenge Mrs May and would ""stand back and champion"" another candidate if they represented the ""right package of ideas"".""I did not sit down with a plan 20 years ago to become prime minister,"" he added.Mr Freeman said the advantage of having a contest next summer was that the issue of whether Brexit would happen would be settled by then and the party would, instead ""be debating where we take it"".And he said the Conservatives needed to focus on other issues, apart from Brexit and deficit, if they were to persuade young people that they were not ""technocratic, burnt-out and energy less"". Fellow Tory MP Tom Tugendhat has also called for ""a generational shift"" in the leadership of the party if and when Mrs May stands down. He told the Spectator: ""The vast majority of my generation wants to stop banging on about Europe. We want to talk about the optimism we feel in this country.' "
2018-09-15,New system to choose next first minister,https://web.archive.org//web/20180916021644/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-45512635,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA crucial decision on how Welsh Labour elects its next leader- and Wales' next first minister - will be taken by a special party conference later. It follows months of wrangling over whether the votes of all party members should carry the same weight.Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford and Health Secretary Vaughan Gething are in the running to succeed First Minister Carwyn Jones who is to step downDelegates will be asked if they want to move to the one-member-one-vote system.UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was the first from the party to be elected using the method, known as Omov.Should it be adopted in Wales, it would mean all party members - and the members of unions and affiliated groups - get an equal vote.A second option for members at Saturday's conference in Cardiff would be to reform Welsh Labour's electoral college, giving half the vote to party members and half to affiliated members.Both options emerged from a review by former Labour Party Cabinet member Lord Murphy, who was brought in after an outcry from supporters of Omov.Labour's ruling executive initially wanted to keep the college which splits leadership election votes three ways between members, unions and politicians.Mr Drakeford, the Cardiff West AM, is the favourite to succeed Mr Jones as leader when he stands down in December, is a leading supporter of Omov.Wales' biggest union Unite is also in favour. Its regional secretary for Wales, Peter Hughes, said the ""fudged option of a reformed electoral college will only extend the division"".Mr Gething, the Cardiff South and Penarth AM, and Mr Drakeford are the only contenders with enough backing from Labour AMs to make it onto the Welsh leadership ballot paper.Eluned Morgan, Huw Irranca-Davies and Alun Davies have also said they want to stand in the election but do not have enough backing.For some, it's been a badge of honour for Welsh Labour, preserving the status of unions within the Labour Party.Others say the electoral college has cast a shadow over Labour since devolution, frustrating the will of rank and file members.It cost Rhodri Morgan the leadership in 1999. He couldn't beat Alun Michael for the top job, even though Mr Morgan had more support in the party's grassroots.Some of those who were closest to him looked on in dismay when history repeated itself in April. His widow, Julie, lost the contest to become deputy Welsh Labour leader, despite being the favourite of rank-and-file party members.The college splits the vote three ways: between party members, unions and affiliated groups, and politicians.In the rest of Britain, Labour has scrapped it. Jeremy Corbyn has twice been elected leader after one-member-one-vote elections.Either option from the Murphy review would remove politicians from the equation.But with enthusiastic support from constituency Labour Party groups - and backing from the biggest union, Unite - today could spell the end for the electoral college altogether."
2018-09-15,Union boss criticised over Israel comments,https://web.archive.org//web/20180916021644/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45517094,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA trade union leader has been recorded suggesting that Israel ""created"" the anti-Semitism row in the Labour Party.In a recording published by the Independent, PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka suggested the country had created the story to hide what he called its own ""atrocities"".Labour Against Anti-Semitism said Mr Serwotka had brought the entire TUC into disrepute and he should resign.The PCS said he had made the point that anti-Semitism must be opposed.Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ""By trading in conspiracy theories and stock anti-Semitic tropes, Mark Serwotka has demeaned his office. ""The only reason Labour's anti-Semitism crisis remains in the media is Labour's failure to deal with it. ""Mr Serwotka should apologise or face disciplinary action from the TUC and the Public and Commercial Services Union.""And Matt Zarb-Cousin, Jeremy Corbyn's former spokesman, said the comments were wrong and ""very unhelpful"".  The Independent reported that Mr Serwokta had told an event organised by the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign at the TUC this week that there was no place for anti-Semitism in the Labour movement.""I think it's unfortunate that the Labour Party allowed a lot of this to drag on, in a way that actually didn't help anybody,"" he said.But he cited the controversial decision by US President Donald Trump to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and the unspecified killing by Israeli troops of ""dozens of Palestiniansâ¦ unarmed, innocent civilians"" as among the real issues being distracted from by ""a summer of asking ourselves whether leading Labour movement people are in any way anti-Semitic?"".""Now I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I'll tell you what - one of the best forms of trying to hide from the atrocities that you are committing is to go on the offensive and to actually create a story that does not exist for people on this platform, the trade union movement or, I have to say, for the leader of the Labour Party,"" he said.Mr Serwotka is general secretary of the largest civil service trade union, the Public and Commercial Services Union, a post he has held since December 2000. He was re-elected in 2005, 2009 and 2014.In 2015 he was among people banned from voting in Labour's leadership election on the grounds they did not share the party's ""aims and values"" - new rules had allowed non-members to vote as ""registered supporters"". In 2016, he rejoined the Labour Party after 25 years, saying Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offered a ""genuine break from the past"".On Wednesday it was announced that had been elected TUC president for the coming year.Labour has been dealing with a row about the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than two years. A 2016 inquiry, carried out by Shami Chakrabarti, concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism, there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". But the row over the way the leadership has handled anti-Semitism allegations continued and dominated media coverage of the party over the summer. There was much controversy over a new code of conduct the party adopted on anti-Semitism, amid criticism it did not go as far as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's guidelines.Veteran MP Frank Field quit the party's parliamentary group in August, saying the leadership was becoming a ""force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". Earlier this month the party's ruling body agreed to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism.Mr Corbyn has apologised for hurt caused by anti-Semitism in the party and pledged to stamp it out.He has stressed that people who hold anti-Semitic views ""have no place in the Labour Party"" and said people who use ""anti-Semitic poison"" are not his supporters, nor do they speak for him or the party.A spokesperson for the Public and Commercial Services Union said: ""Mark spoke at a Palestine Solidarity Campaign fringe event at the TUC - an organisation PCS is affiliated to.""He made the point at the start of the meeting, that we need to oppose anti-Semitism in society and within the Labour movement.""But we should not allow the issue of anti-Semitism to be used by people who are attempting to silence Palestinian voices as they legitimately struggle for their rights and a sovereign state."""

Ruth Davidson said the prime minister should be given the space to negotiate the best deal possible with the EU. And she called on the rival factions within the Tory party to recognise the need for compromise over Brexit.She also ruled out leaving the Scottish Parliament for Westminster before the next Holyrood election in 2021.Ms Davidson, who is due to give birth to her first child next month, was speaking to BBC Scotland amid mounting speculation about the prime minister's future.The MP George Freeman has openly called for a leadership contest next summer after Brexit is settled. There have also been strong rumours that former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a leading Brexiteer, is considering challenging Mrs May for the leadership after recently describing her Brexit plans as a ""suicide vest"". Ms Davidson said the prime minister was currently in the midst of some of the ""toughest and most complex"" negotiations about the future of the country since the Second World War.And she urged politicians from all sides to temper their language during the current ""febrile"" debate over Brexit.She added: ""What I would say to a number of my colleagues who are making noises right now is let the woman do her job, let her deliver for the country. ""There is a really important job to do right now. The prime minister is applying herself - this is her duty to deliver for the country. Let her do it and let's get behind her as she does it.""She's the prime minister of this country and she needs to have people quit the noises off and let her deliver in this really crucial moment in our country's history. ""Ms Davidson - who has been tipped by some as a future leader of the UK party - said she had backed Ms May's leadership bid two years ago, and would continue to support her now and for however long she wished to remain in the job.She said decisions made in the weeks ahead would ""define the road of travel"" for the country over the coming years, and said she was keen to give the prime minister the space to negotiate the best possible Brexit deal for the country.She also predicted that, when a deal is agreed with the EU and comes back to the House of Commons for consideration, it would ""focus the minds"" of MPs. Ms Davidson added: ""As a committed Remainer I am not going to get everything I want out of this deal, and neither is a committed Brexiteer that is on the other side, but deals are about compromise.""Ms Davidson gave a wide-ranging interview to BBC Scotland, with the other topics covered including:Rumours she will quit Holyrood for WestminsterMs Davidson said her job was in Scotland. She said she wanted to retain her Edinburgh Central seat at the next Holyrood election in 2021 and become the country's next first minister - and the first Conservative first minister. She added: ""I am going to be based here and I am going to be taking on Nicola Sturgeon in 2021.""Divisions within the 13 Scottish Conservative MPs over BrexitDespite Ms Davidson being a high-profile supporter of Remain during the referendum, some of her party's 13 MPs are hardline Brexiteers - with Ross Thomson in particular being a vocal critic of the prime minister's Chequers proposals.Ms Davidson said all 650 MPs had differing opinions over Brexit, ranging from those who still want to remain in the EU to those Brexiteers who wish to have almost no relationship with the EU in the future.She said: ""Ross was a leading member of the Leave movement in Scotland, and we've got to remember over a million people voted to leave in Scotland, so his views are well known.""But on areas like, for example, ensuring our fishermen get a good deal as we leave, Ross and I are as one.""On so-called 'Dark Money' allegationsMs Davidson confirmed that Richard Cook, who has been at the centre of controversy over a Â£425,000 donation to the Democratic Unionist Party's Brexit campaign, remains a Scottish Conservative member but ""holds no office"".She said the Electoral Commission had already concluded that there was insufficient evidence to investigate allegations that the donation was used to circumvent spending limits for the Leave campaign.She said: ""This donation isn't linked to the Scottish party, it wasn't given to the Scottish party.""It was given to another political party in another country to fight a referendum on the side that the Scottish Conservative leader was fighting against.""Ms Davidson also insisted the Scottish Unionist Association Trust, which donates money to Conservative election campaigns, is registered with the Electoral Commission and that there was ""utter transparency"" about where the money comes from.  She said ""almost all"" Scottish Conservative candidates would have benefitted from the trust, but said she had ""absolutely not"" taken money from it to part-fund a campaign manager as others, including Scottish Secretary David Mundell, have done.

2018-09-15,Gove sorry for attending Paisley dinner,https://web.archive.org//web/20180916021644/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45515428,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove has apologised for attending a dinner hosted last year by Ian Paisley, according to a Conservative councillor. David Harding said Mr Gove was unaware the event in the Tullyglass Hotel was a ""fundraiser"". The Coleraine councillor said he received the personal apology at a meeting in Belfast. The news comes after a second council was criticised for using rate payers money to sponsor a table at the event.  Causeway Coast and Glens Council paid Â£1,500 for the table at last September's event hosted by the DUP's Ian Paisley. It was previously revealed Mid and East Antrim Borough Council had sponsored another table for the same sum.That is now being treated as a ""donation"" to the North Antrim MP by the Electoral Commission.Mr Harding, who is a councillor on the Causeway Coast and Glens Council, said he had met Mr Gove and a special advisor some time after the Tullyglass dinner and he said both apologised to him.""There's a clear instruction from the Conservative Party that members of the government do not attend functions that promote the interests of other parties or raise money for them and it shouldn't happen"" said Mr Harding.""They said they were clear this was a business event, that it wasn't a DUP event, that although it had been arranged by Ian Paisley, this wasn't about raising money for the DUP which it obviously was.""Mr Harding added that he believed Causeway Coast and Glens Council ""genuinely thought it was a business event"".He said the Â£1,500 was ratepayers money and it ""has to be spent well"", but that ""it is the sort of money that can be spent sensibly to promote business in the area"".Mr Harding added: ""I think it's just disgraceful that this event was presented as one thing and was clearly something else.""Causeway Coast and Glens council said the payment was within its guidelines.Councils are not considered ""permissible donors"" and money from such bodies must be returned.In a letter to Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson, Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council said the money was paid directly to the Tullyglass Hotel which hosted the dinner. But Mr Dickson said the payment raises serious questions.""This is public money and we are now talking about two councils spending over Â£3,000 of ratepayers' money for something that was billed - and is all over the local newspapers - as a DUP fundraising event,"" he said. ""A dinner which was held in Ballymena by Ian Paisley MP and indeed was bragged about as a fundraising event by some of his councillors.""The Alliance MLA said he was also concerned about how the decision to sponsor a table was taken.""This wasn't a decision by local councillors, this appears to have been taken entirely by council officers on the basis of a letter they received from an organisation which according to Mid and East Antrim, doesn't even exist, "" he said.In the letter seen by the BBC, the council said the ""spend level for attendance"" at the dinner ""did not require councillors' agreement in accordance with council's procurement policy and specifically the delegated responsibility to officers"".It added ""you will therefore not find a specific council minute which relates to this matter"".In a further statement, it said the keynote speaker at the event was MP Michael Gove and that subjects discussed included Brexit, passenger air tariffs and their impact upon tourism and business travel and the effect of public sector cuts upon rural services. ""Council agreed to attend the event and invite guests who would benefit from both the subject matter and the potential networking opportunities,"" it said. ""Those guests included representatives of our hospitality, food distribution and production, agriculture and leisure industries with an emphasis on the rural aspects of the borough.""The Northern Ireland Auditor's office has confirmed it looked into the payment as part of a wider audit of Causeway Coast and Glens Council and will be making recommendations in the coming weeks.Meanwhile, the Electoral Commission has said it is aware of the payment made by the council, but can't comment any further as its investigation is ongoing.In a statement, Mr Paisley said he was ""content to wait for the outcome of the commission's inquiry"" which he added ""commenced after political rivals made a complaint"". He said his ""annual community and business engagement dinner in Ballymena was very successful and enjoyed by all who attended"".  "

Then, many in the party felt that the existing top brass had passed their best, and the Conservatives needed fresh thinking and leadership. The slogan may have baggage, but more than a decade later, that question rather sums up why the suggestion from former minister George Freeman, on Thursday evening, that Theresa May should move on after March, can't be easily ignored. Very few Tory MPs want to say it publicly, but if they asked each other, ""Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"" many of them would confess, and admit privately in conversation that once the Brexit deal is done and we have left the EU in the spring, then Theresa May should make clear her intention not to fight the next election at a minimum.  Many believe that she should depart, or say that she is off almost immediately after that moment. Mr Freeman is not trying to push her out now and was effusive in praise for how she's managed so far. But his comments underline a widespread private assumption shared by many MPs and some ministers too - which of course may turn out to be wrong - that once the tortuous process of getting out of the EU is done, the best hope for the Tories of turning the page on the whole saga, is a new face at the helm. One senior MP, who is trying their best, for now, to keep the very rocky show on the road and who knows Theresa May well and has advised her many times told me: ""In March she's gone. Either she will have to set that out or people like me will tell her she has to go. ""If she doesn't say she's off, the letters will go in, and that will be it, so we can move on.""Some of the ministers seeking to make their mark have notions that they have a few months to do that before a potential contest. Remember, one of the big reasons that there hasn't been a leadership contest so far is that no wannabe wanted to take on the problems of Brexit. Once we have actually left, while many decisions and complexities will linger, the UK will have actually left, which should, in theory at least, create a space to change the political conversation. This is not about a handful of Brexiteers agitating to shove her out rudely because they don't like the direction of travel for the next few months. It's not about saying that there will be a sudden schism and they will crash into a leadership contest. But it's about a general sense across different wings of the Conservative Party, that Theresa May's time and political energy will have been run down by Brexit. Hold on for a minute. Politics is a rollercoaster - of course this is not inevitable. One government minister was furious this week when I asked about the very assumption that Mrs May could have less than a year in office, lambasting colleagues for discussing the subject, practically claiming that it's not a genuine topic of conversation. Another of her Cabinet allies told me tonight that ""if she delivers a good Brexit deal and the country is still moving forward, then Theresa May will still find herself in a very good position"", with the potential of leading the country and staying on for years to come. Certainly, time after time Theresa May has surprised and defied those who've tried to tear her down. What is the case though, is that many Tories have already made their minds up, that her time will be up within the next year. And in articulating his view publicly, Mr Freeman is saying what huge numbers of his colleagues have been thinking too. "
2018-09-15,'Not a forecast',https://web.archive.org//web/20180916021644/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45519309,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Governor of the Bank of England has always been clear about two things.That the present Brexit process has had negative effects on the broader economy and on people's incomes.And that a Brexit deal where there is no formal agreement between Britain and the European Union would make those effects worse.As Mark Carney said to me in an interview earlier this week to mark the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis, Brexit is one of the Big Four risks the Bank is facing.A debt crisis in China, problematically high household debt in the UK and a catastrophic cyber-attack taking out a whole bank are the others.""There are risks around Brexit for the financial sector,"" he told me.""And here's something that's changed with the system from 10 years ago - we are absolutely upfront about those risks, our view of those risks.""We have stress tested our banks against those risks to make sure they have enough of a safety net, both in terms of their own funds plus liquid funds, in case we had a no deal Brexit.""The key phrase is ""stress tested"".The Bank's Financial Policy Committee regularly sets ""doomsday scenarios"" to test the banking system's robustness in the face of a significant shock.The last stress test in November involved a scenario where house prices fell by 33%, interest rates rose to 4% and unemployment doubled.It became known as the ""no deal test"" and is remarkably close to the headlines we are seeing this morning.It appears that the Governor wasn't providing the Cabinet with a forecast of what the Bank believes would happen in the event of a no deal Brexit.He was briefing the Cabinet on what preparations the Bank was making if that does happen, including last November's stress test.It was not a forecast. It was an apocalyptic test where the Bank deliberately sets the parameters beyond what might reasonably be expected to occur.The major banks all passed the test, giving reassurance that the financial system can cope with whatever happens next year.The Governor believes that a ""no deal"" scenario would be bad for the economy.But not as bad as the headlines today which are based on a doomsday scenario that is not actually forecast to happen.There is another point that is often lost in the loudness of the negative headlines.If there is a ""good deal"" with the EU, Mr Carney believes there could be a significant boost to the economy as pent-up demand held back by the present uncertainty is released.Investment could rise markedly, he has argued.Those are the options as he sees them, and it is up to the politicians on both sides of the negotiation to come to a decision on which route they take."
2018-09-15,No-deal preparations,https://web.archive.org//web/20180916021644/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45514495,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA lot of hassle and potential cost for a lot of people. The government's spent the afternoon giving details of what might need to happen, if there was no deal with the EU.There's no guarantee you'd be able to avoid big phone bills if you use your mobile abroad, although ministers say they'd cap any data charges at Â£45 a month and some of the firms say they won't change prices. If you want to go on the road on the continent, you might need an International Driving Permit. If you want to jump on a cheap flight for a last-minute weekend, better check you have six months left on your passport, or you might be turned back.If there isn't a deal, many products tested in the UK after Brexit will have to go through the same process again - but with an EU authority in charge. The list of what might have to happen is a very long one. And some of the trickiest implications, like what would happen to planes flying between European and British skies, haven't even been published yet. And as the French foreign minister suggested, the Eurostar might not be able to run, and yes, planes may not be able to fly if a resolution can't be found. Publishing the papers are part of the government's plan to look like they are prepared for the potential shock and disruption of the negotiations failing. And indeed, for some in government, publicly detailing those preparations is part of a tactic to suggest that they have a way out and are ready to walk away, if Brussels doesn't budge. What ministers won't say, however, is how much money we might have to pay the EU if there were to be no deal. The Brexit secretary and the prime minister have both repeatedly said that the estimated price tag of nearly Â£40bn if there is a deal would not be paid in full. But they refuse point blank to give an assessment of how much it would be, if we walked away without an agreement. The reality is the cost would probably still be many billions, and it would take lawyers many, many years to be able to agree on it. In that situation, the government would be walking away without being able to tell MPs or the public how much we would still have to stump up. Ministers' belief, however, is that the chances of there being no agreement are now relatively small. They are hopeful that next week EU leaders will give helpful hints at a special meeting in Salzburg. On Thursday, the Brexit secretary told me he believes the EU will meet the UK ""half way"" on the Irish border issue, which for many many months has been the trickiest issue of all.Yet there is a long way to go until he, or anyone in government, can be sure. And don't doubt that many Tory MPs are adamant they simply won't vote for the kind of proposal Theresa May has put on the table. One senior MP told me: ""If people in Number 10 haven't made clear to her that 'Chequers minus minus' isn't going to get through the Commons, then she is getting the wrong advice."" After all, there are two kinds of ""no deal"" - one seems very unlikely, where the EU and the UK simply can't agree. The prime minister comes back to Parliament and says: ""I'm sorry, I tried, but it just won't wash.""But the other is that Theresa May comes back with a deal but her party, and Parliament, chucks it out. The political climate would be different in those two cases. But in the potential chaos of either, the hassle outlined on Thursday might just be the start. "

There is massive frustration with her leadership, her position on Chequers and the way her proposals tuck the UK closely into the EU in perpetuity. And yes, there are some MPs who want to see her gone immediately. However senior voices in the European Research Group - yes them - are adamant that it is not the time to try to oust the PM. It would be ""stupid"", one told me last night. Imagine in these critical weeks of the Brexit negotiations if the UK started to try to change the prime minister. Right now those jostling to remove her know they don't have any guarantees they would have the numbers to force her out, even though they may well be able to pull together enough MPs to submit letters to the chair of 1922 committee to trigger a contest.So are the Eurosceptics coldly gaming the options for how to get their way? Does that include discussing if, when and how, they could try to push the prime minister out of office? Absolutely. But does it mean we are on the verge of a coup being launched against Number 10? Things can change very fast these days. But don't be so sure."

The proposals are contained in a report by the pressure group Economists for Free Trade (EFT). Here's an initial look at a few of the claims they've made. These figures are based on a number of calculations and assumptions, not all of which stand up to scrutiny. Those who have modelled a clean Brexit properly, the EFT asserts, report long-term gains from free trade of 2%-4% of GDP. The report dismisses alternative modelling - done by the Treasury and by Whitehall's Cross Departmental Brexit Analysis - which arrived at very different conclusions. But that is part of the problem. The EFT are convinced that they are the only people who have modelled the data correctly - even though theirs is a minority view.""The vast majority of economists think it will be different,"" says Prof Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex.""Because a hard Brexit will cut trade with the EU, which is by far our largest trading partner, significantly.""Chequers plan 'worse than status quo'What is the 'no deal' WTO option?Last year the UK exported almost Â£274bn in goods and services to the EU, compared with Â£112bn to the US. When it comes to imports, the UK imported Â£341bn in goods and services from the EU and Â£70bn from the US.  For those who love the detail, here is one example of economists who criticise the EFT's methodology. Tory supporters of Brexit are, however, unbowed: ""Perhaps it's our fault,"" says leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, ""by not putting the argument for a world trade deal earlier, we left the running to people who don't want us to leave the EU at all.""The EFT report also says the UK would no longer have to pay a net amount of Â£12bn to the EU every year, although that figure appears to be slightly inflated.According to the Treasury net payments to the EU amounted to Â£9.6bn in 2016 and Â£8.9bn in 2017. Forecasts over the next five years suggest that - if the UK were to stay in the EU - net payments to the EU would rise to roughly Â£11bn a year.The EFT report goes on to  suggests that the UK could choose to withhold ""most or all"" of the estimated Â£39bn financial settlement that the government has provisionally agreed to pay the EU as part of a Withdrawal Agreement. In theory, the UK could do that, but it would probably prompt a legal challenge from the EU, and it would certainly damage relations severely at a time when - as the EFT report suggests - the government would be looking for co-operation in a whole series of policy areas. It says only 4% of goods arriving in the UK from non-EU countries are subject to checks, and it suggests that trade with the EU in future could therefore be almost as seamless as it is now.  It's correct that very few physical or documentary checks are carried out on non-EU goods. But evidence given to the Home Affairs Select Committee suggests that things are rather more complicated than that. If a lorry arrives at Dover, for example, from a non-EU country, it is usually delayed by 60 to 90 minutes even if no checks are made. The UK could choose to speed up that process and abolish many checks, but there would still be far more checks on UK goods being exported to the EU via Dover. There would also be further complications for UK exports. Once the UK is designated as a third country by the EU, all UK exports of animal origin would only be able to enter EU territory via a veterinary border inspection post, where there are often time-consuming physical inspections as well as documentary checks. Neither the Eurotunnel nor the Calais port is currently designated as a veterinary border inspection post. The EFT report says that under WTO rules sanitary and phytosanitary measures (ie safety checks on food) can't be used as a ""surreptitious means of inhibiting cross-border trade"". This is true, but that does not erase what are known as non-tariff-barriers entirely, it simply reduces inspections where possible. ""The only countries that have managed to remove the need for health checks on food being exported to the EU,"" says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform, ""are the European Economic Area members and Switzerland. They have not only implemented EU rules in this area domestically, they also apply EU checks on all imports of animal origin entering from the rest of the world."" The EFT report also suggests lifting tariffs (or import charges) on imported goods to make prices cheaper. It recognises that if you do that for one country, you have to do it for every country, under WTO rules. If tariffs were removed for all agricultural produce, cheap imports would flood in and food prices would fall - but the UK farming industry could be decimated. So, the report says, that ""perhaps the most attractive goods to target"" might be ones that we don't produce in the UK at all. It mentions oranges as one example, but it would be a pretty limited number of goods.  Again, others are extremely sceptical about the EFT's policy proposals. According to a report published earlier this year by the House of Lords European Union Committee, ""EU food imports cannot easily be replaced by either producing more in the UK or importing more from non-EU countries"". The Lords report forecast that food prices were likely to rise without a Brexit deal. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.3%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-15,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180916021644/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

""We have to seize what we want now,"" he said. ""That's what people voted for. That's what Brexit is about, leaving with the right deal. ""And the prime minister, at the same time, has got to recognise that there is an alternative [to the Chequers deal], called the WTO [World Trade Organisation].""He continued: ""There's another alternative called free trade which the European Union is demanding and asking for.""So let's get on and deal with that and sort the border out, not mess around with Chequers.""By Chris Mason, political correspondentMichael Gove is flashing a saucy bit of Brexiteer ankle at some of his Conservative colleagues who also voted Leave, but think the prime minister's plan is a dud.Suck it up for now, spit out later, he suggests - while openly imagining the political world after Theresa May.It's a reminder that Brexiteers in the parliamentary Conservative Party are divided - between those willing to live with her Brexit plan, and those who want to ""chuck Chequers"". Who wins this tug of war could determine what Brexit looks like and how long the Prime Minister lasts.In an interview to mark the six-month countdown to Brexit, Mrs May told Nick Robinson on the BBC's Panorama programme she was irritated by the ongoing speculation over her position as prime minister.Asked if she would reassure the Tory party that she was not determined to go ""on and on"", she said: ""I get a little bit irritated but this debate is not about my future. This debate is about the future of the people of the UK and the future of the United Kingdom. ""That's what I'm focused on and that's what we should all be focused on.  ""It's ensuring that we get that good deal from the European Union which is good for people in the UK, wherever they live in the UK, that's what's important for us.""""Theresa May's aides know that she - they - are in the battle of their political lives not just to secure a deal with the EU's 27 other leaders but to sell it to a party that is deeply sceptical, a parliament which is deeply divided and a public which is growing heartily sick of Brexit and the Tories infighting [writes Nick Robinson].""That is the reason I and a team from BBC One's Panorama were invited 'Inside Number 10' to make a film which they hope will would pull back the curtain just a little on the the serious, shy, and, at times, awkward leader they serve.""Read more from Nick Robinson in the Sunday Times (behind a paywall).Please upgrade your browserRead the full glossary here Mrs May's comments came days after Conservative MPs opposed to her Brexit plan met to discuss how and when they could force her to stand down.About 50 Brexit-supporting members of the European Research Group (ERG) met on Tuesday to discuss a leadership challenge.Mrs May has said she wants to strike a trade deal with the EU for after the UK leaves on 29 March 2019.She has also said there needs to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland, in order to avoid a hard border there.The UK and EU are hoping to agree a way forward next month, at the same time as they settle the terms of the UK's withdrawal, including a transition period up to the end of 2020.We voted in 2016 â why is it taking so long to leave?Well, none of the major players has ever left the European Union before...So there are some BIG problems to solveSuch as how we donât end up worse-off economicallyThe EU has a ""single market"" - goods from other EU countries aren't taxed at the borderAnd people can also move around as if the EU was a single countryOutside the EU, the UK might have to pay more to buy from and sell to EU countriesThis could also slow the flow of goods and parts, disrupting production for UK firmsThe EU says Britain canât cherry pick â keeping some benefits without membershipBut that could mean the UK is freer to make other trade deals around the worldAny special deal the UK wants has to be approved by MPs firstThen the deal has to be agreed by 27 national parliaments across EuropeThatâs a lot of people who need to agree with each otherâ¦So, the date UK is meant to leave is 29 March 2019But there are already plans for a 21-month transition period after thatDuring which the UK could still be governed by some EU lawsA trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to agreeHowever, as the UKâs already fully aligned with the EU, it could be quickerBut it is likely that we will all be talking about Brexit for a long time yet...Click next arrow to proceedLoading ...Swipe to progress(If you can't see the explainer, follow this link)BBC Panorama, Inside No 10: Deal or No Deal? is on Monday 17 September at 20:30 BST on BBC One as part of a week on in-depth coverage across the BBC to mark Brexit: Six Months to Go."

He said the party's 12 MPs - with one exception - were ""solid"" in their determination to stop Brexit.Stephen Lloyd MP voted Remain but has vowed to respect the wishes of his Leave-voting Eastbourne constituents.Mr Cable said he hoped to persuade Mr Lloyd to change his mind before the ""meaningful"" vote promised to MPs on the terms of any Brexit deal.Downing Street believes it can get Mrs May's Chequers plan - which would see the UK obeying single market rules for goods after Brexit - through Parliament, despite opposition from many Conservative MPs.Mr Cable, who was business secretary in David Cameron's coalition government, said the Chequers deal had an ""enormous hole in it"" because it did not include services - which make up 80% of the British economy.The Chequers plan was a ""second best solution"" to the issue of frictionless trade in goods but was based on a ""very, very complicated mechanism,"" he added.And Mr Cable said he could not vote for it even if the government claimed the only alternative was a no deal Brexit because there are ""better alternatives"".Sir Vince, who is campaigning for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said: ""We're absolutely solid that we need to vote against Brexit and stop it.""In other  conference developments:Speaking at an earlier meeting, Mr Cable warned the world economy ""could well"" be heading for a serious crash within the ""next 18 months to two years"".The Lib Dem leader - who famously predicted the 2008 financial crash - warned about ""dangerously high"" levels of debt in the UK economy.And it was ""difficult to see"" major economies coming together to tackle any crisis as they did in 2008 with the current political climate, he added.The Lib Dem leader is also calling for the creation of a  Â£100bn ""citizens fund"" to protect the UK from future economic crises by bolstering the public finances.The fund could be built up through taxes on the rich and the sale of state assets, such as the UK stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, he argues."

Criticised for his authoritarian style, he has told Hungarian TV: ""We will never allow Hungary to become a target country for immigrants.""Mr Trickett said it was ""shocking"" that Conservatives had whipped their 19 MEPs to vote against the motion to censure Hungary, with only one defying the order.  He said the environment secretary had declined the opportunity to distance himself from Mr Orban's ""authoritarian and anti-democratic practices"", adding: ""Theresa May should do what Gove failed to do and condemn the Hungarian government.""Viktor Orban was re-elected earlier this year after campaigning on an anti-immigration platform, with his Fidesz party winning two thirds of parliamentary seats.Since coming to power, his government has taken a hard-line stance against immigration. It introduced a law which made it a criminal offence for lawyers and activists to help asylum seekers, under the banner of ""facilitating illegal immigration"".But there have also been reports of pressure being put on the courts and the electoral system and widespread corruption.The European Parliament has voted to pursue unprecedented disciplinary action against Hungary over alleged breaches of the EU's core values, which it denies.The ultimate sanction, the suspension of Hungary's voting rights, is not being proposed. But the EU Council - the heads of government of the member states - will now begin a process which could lead to potential recommendations being made against Hungary. After Wednesday's vote, the Board of Deputies of British Jews said it was disappointed Conservative MEPs had voted in ""defence"" of Hungary, while the Muslim Council of Britain questioned whether the Tories were seeking backing for its position on Brexit in return.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell was among the Labour MPs to criticise the vote at the time, urging Theresa May to ""call out"" her MEPs.Conservative peer Lord Finklestein described it as ""a really distressing thing to happen and shameful"".However, the Tory MEPs had stressed their vote should not be seen as a backing of Mr Orban.Mr Gove told Andrew Marr: ""It is not for me to rank a league table of EU leaders.""It's a long-standing principle of a number of MEPs from different countries and from different parties not to believe that the European Parliament should interfere in or censure the internal democracy of a particular country.""Challenged to directly condemn Mr Orban, he said: ""You or I might have particular views about other countries but the European Parliament and those within it - British MEPs and others - believe that's the wrong way of expressing criticism.""Asked by Marr if the party needed Mr Orban's support for its Brexit plan, Mr Gove said: ""No, because I think it would be wrong for me at a time when we need solidarity against a number of different threats - you mention anti-Semitism...""I don't believe that individual criticisms of the kind you are understandably attempting me to make necessarily help us in ensuring we get both solidarity on the issues that count and the best deal for Britain as we leave the European Union."""

In an interview with the Sunday Times Magazine, she revealed her struggles with self-harm, suicidal thoughts and depression as a teenager.The MSP, who is expecting her first child, also ruled out a peerage or becoming an MP at Westminster.She said the idea of leaving her child in Edinburgh was ""actually offensive"".Ms Davidson announced she and her partner Jen Wilson were expecting a baby in April, after undergoing IVF treatment. She is expected to give birth in October, and has announced her plans to take four or five months of maternity leave. Ruling out taking the helm at Downing Street, the 39-year-old, who is releasing her memoirs in the paper, said: ""You have to want it, and I don't want to be prime minister"".In 2016, while David Cameron was PM, she described the role as ""the loneliest job in the world"". Speaking frankly about her teenage years, Ms Davidson said her mental heath suffered after a boy from her village took his own life when she was 17 years old.""I went into a total tailspin"", she said.She said she started cutting herself, ""punching walls... drinking far, far, too much and becoming belligerent and angry"".She was diagnosed with clinical depression a year later, but said the medication meant she had ""dark, terrible dreams"" and ""couldn't tell what was real"". In her second year studying English at Edinburgh University, she became so afraid of sleep she said she spent a whole term living nocturnally. She said her depression ""was like a smothering black blanket over my head, cutting out the sky"".""It was heavy, constricting, suffocating. It took away hope and energy and life.""The MSP said she combated her mental health issues by exercising regularly, moderating her alcohol intake, going back to church, and ""most importantly to me, I threw away my pills"".But she said she was still ""frightened of going back to the psychological place [she] once inhabited"".""When I have a period of heightened anxiety, or I can feel the weight of the black blanket start to descend, I go back to what I know works for me: structure, exercise, forward momentum, measurable outcomes. Sometime's that's hard in a job that's 100 miles an hour.""  Toni Giugliano, policy manager at the Mental Health Foundation in Scotland, said: ""Ruth's decision to speak out takes courage and will hopefully encourage others to do the same.""He said stigma was still ""very present"" in society.""That's why it's so important for CEOs, bosses and national leaders to speak out about their own experiences and help drive change.""If you are struggling to cope, you can call Samaritans free on 116 123 (UK and Ireland) or visit the BBC Action Line website."

He said he had never expected to back calls for a second referendum, but had become ""increasingly alarmed as the chaotic approach to the negotiations had become mired in confusion and deadlock"".With time running out for the British government to negotiate a final deal with the EU before March 2019, Mr Khan said the UK was left with two ""incredibly risky"" possibilities.""Both these scenarios are a million miles from what was promised during the referendum campaign, only further exposing the lies and mistruths sold to the public,"" he wrote in the paper.""I don't believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people's livelihoods.""Appearing on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Khan was shown comments he made to LBC radio after the Brexit referendum, in which he warned a fresh poll would lead to ""even more cynicism"" among voters.He told Marr: ""It's really important that this is not a re-run of the referendum but the British public having a say for the first time on the outcome."" Pushed on what voters should be asked in a fresh vote, he said it should be a choice between the government's deal and remaining in the EU.Asked whether that would disenfranchise supporters of a hard Brexit, Mr Khan added: ""My point is this. Rather than having a bad deal or a no deal, let's put that to the British public with the option of staying in the EU.""Mr Khan also dismissed suggestions he was trying to distract from his track record as London mayor, following criticisms of his record on knife crime, housing and transport.Appearing on the same programme, Environment Secretary Mr Gove, a leading Brexiteer during the referendum, said Mr Khan's comments were ""troubling"".""People voted clearly - 17.4m people - to leave the European Union,"" Mr Gove said. ""Sadiq is essentially saying, 'Stop, lets delay the process, let's throw it into chaos'. And I think that would be a profound mistake.""Meanwhile, Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson accused Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of ""backing the government every step of the way"" over Brexit. ""Jeremy Corbyn is letting the prime minister off the hook,"" she said in a speech to her party's annual conference in Brighton.""My message to him is very clear. Grow a backbone, stand up for the millions of people who voted for you and help us stop Brexit.""The Lib Dems want another referendum and are talking to disaffected anti-Brexit Labour and Tory MPs who, they say, are considering quitting their parties.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Theresa May said the government would not back another vote.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, she said: ""To ask the question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy - and a betrayal of that trust.""Please upgrade your browserMeanwhile, in a letter to Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, published by The Sunday Times, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer warned the government that Labour MPs will vote down attempts to force the country into a ""blind Brexit"".It comes as the People's Vote campaign, which wants a new referendum on Brexit, is attempting to change Labour Party policy, according to a leaked memo.Earlier this month GMB general secretary Tim Roache said the union backed a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, urging Labour to ""follow suit"".

A sovereign wealth fund would bolster public finances, he will add.The Lib Dem leader - who famously predicted the 2008 financial crash - warned about ""dangerously high"" levels of debt in the UK economy.A wealth fund would, he hopes, allow the UK to benefit from returns on investments typically only available to the wealthy and protect the UK from future economic crises. Explaining the policy on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said he wanted to scrap inheritance tax and replace it with ""a tax on people's gifts through their lifetime"".Such a move was needed, he said, because ""the inequalities of wealth are massive and growing and one of the major sources of underlying dissatisfaction"".Asked about comments by former Lib Dem leader Lord Campbell, who said Sir Vince ""can see the end of the road"", he said: ""I'm not running out of road, there's a lot of road ahead.""Sir Vince has previously said he would stay on until Brexit was ""resolved or stopped"" but would be gone before the next general election in 2022.Asked if he would still be party leader by the end of next year, Sir Vince said: ""I think that's uncertain. I have a series of tasks to do. I'm going to do them. ""I'm not setting a time horizon. I think it would be foolish to do so with so much uncertainty flying around.""Sir Vince said the Lib Dems were talking to disillusioned Labour and Tory MPs, who he claimed were ready to quit their parties over Brexit. But he said setting up a new centre party was ""not a practical proposition"" and ""not going to happen"".Delegates at the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton will debate wealth taxes on Tuesday.BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake says the policy will be an easy sell to members but it will need to find wider support if the party are to re-emerge from the margins of British politics.The Lib Dems have struggled electorally since 2010, when they formed a coalition government with the Conservatives. The party has 12 MPs - down from the 57 they had in 2010. Sir Vince has advocated a change to the party's rules, so that someone who is not an MP could become leader, and ""liberal-minded"" people could sign up to the Lib Dems for free and get the right to vote for the leadership.Lib Dem MP Ed Davey told the BBC he backed Sir Vince's proposed reforms, saying a shake-up of the party would allow it to go ""from strength to strength"".Mr Davey said the party was united behind Sir Vince, who has announced he will stand down before the next general election due in 2022.Asked if he would stand for leader, former energy secretary Mr Davey did not rule himself out, saying: ""I'm not thinking about it at the moment, I'm thinking about supporting Vince.""Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson said they had the ""ingredients to be able to challenge the other parties"".She told Sky News's Sophy Ridge On Sunday: ""The whole idea of a centrist party gets talked about endlessly but doesn't really get off the ground. ""You don't need to set up a new party because the Liberal Democrats are here, but we recognise that we have to change."""

The party says it will renationalise the railways if it gets into power.But the government says privatisation has helped ""transform"" the industry.The UK's rail network has been beset by problems, with the East Coast Mainline brought back under government control in May - for the third time in a decade.Meanwhile, members of the RMT union are holding the latest in a series of 24-hour strikes on Northern and South Western in a long-running dispute over the role of guards on trains. Hundreds of rail services are likely to be cancelled and replacement buses will operate on some routes.The review, to be announced on Thursday, is expected to be led by Keith Williams, the deputy chairman of department store John Lewis.It is likely to examine how issues such as those faced by the East Coast Mainline can be avoided in the future. The franchise was a joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin Trains.This week the Transport Select Committee described the bid to run the line as ""naive"" and said the DfT must take the blame for not managing it effectively.The DfT plans to run the service as the London North Eastern Railway until a new public-private partnership can be appointed in 2020.The government first began to offer Britain's passenger train services to the private sector to run on a franchised basis in the 1990s.Transport secretary Chris Grayling has also faced questions over his handling of the disruption faced by passengers on Thameslink and Great Northern trains this year, following the introduction of new timetables by owner Govia Thameslink. The Office of Rail and Road has launched an inquiry into the problems.Labour has said it would bring the railways back under public ownership if it was in power.Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald said: ""Long-suffering rail passengers don't need a review to explain to them that the franchising system is broken beyond repair. ""No amount of tinkering will change the fact that rail franchising has failed, does not deliver and never will."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""Privatisation has helped transform our railway, doubling passenger numbers and delivering more services, extra investment and new trains.""We are absolutely committed to improving journeys and are always examining ways to improve how the railway serves passengers.""Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group which represents the rail industry, said the public and private sectors had achieved a lot working together over the last 20 years but ""the time is right for root and branch reform""."

It says it has also significantly stepped up efforts to seize dirty Russian money coming into the UK. It has also launched investigations into British-based lawyers and accountants suspected of facilitating money laundering.The NCA leads the UK fight against money laundering and criminal money, which it estimates could be worth up to Â£1bn a day. A number of its investigations have led it to offshore firms registered in the Cayman Islands, which is a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean and one of the world's largest financial centres.Donald Toon, director of the NCA, revealed the Cayman Islands authorities had not co-operated when he had asked for information on who owned these firms.He said that usually when his officers asked British Overseas Territories for help ""we can generally get from them clear, unambiguous beneficial ownership information but we are having a difficulty with Cayman"".""The Cayman government is entirely aware of the UK concerns,"" he said.In recent years the spotlight has been on tax havens linked to the UK following a series of global investigations involving nearly 100 media organisations, including the BBC. The Paradise Papers exposed how wealthy and corrupt individuals used complex offshore structures to cover their tracks. The NCA said there were now signs that criminals were finding new tax havens where they could exploit lax regulation and hide their links to corrupt assets.These were jurisdictions ""well beyond the British Overseas Territories"". Mr Toon called them ""small island nations"" where ""people are able to register companies but are much more difficult to penetrate in terms of getting access to the information"" on beneficial owners. He did not say where. Mr Toon also said the NCA had significantly stepped up its work to identify and seize corrupt Russian assets in the UK - but it was yet to use new powers, known as Unexplained Wealth Orders, against them. Unexplained Wealth Orders, which came into force on 31 January, force wealthy people to explain the source of their assets if there is reason to suspect corruption.""This is not quick work,"" Mr Toon explained, because rich criminals are experts at hiding their ownership of corrupt assets. He revealed there were ""a couple of dozen"" active investigations into lawyers and accountants suspected of facilitating the flow of dirty money into the UK which he described as the ""lifeblood of nearly all organised crime"". Asked if he was concerned that dirty money was being used to fund the private education of the children of corrupt oligarchs, Mr Toon said those private schools with charitable status have to carry out due diligence. However, he said they rarely issue alerts to law enforcement."
2018-09-16,Reform of 'archaic' divorce laws revealed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180917030423/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45525979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMore details have emerged about government plans to overhaul ""archaic"" divorce laws in England and Wales.Couples wishing to divorce could soon benefit from a less confrontational process, under proposals confirmed by the Justice Secretary David Gauke. The government has launched a consultation proposing removing the need to allege ""fault"", and the right of spouses to contest a divorce.Mr Gauke said the current divorce laws were ""out of touch with modern life"".Under the current law, unless people can prove their marriage has broken down due to adultery, unreasonable behaviour or desertion, the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's consent is to live apart for five years.If the separation is mutual, the couple have to prove they have been separated for a minimum of two years before they can divorce.Mr Guake said: ""We think that the blame game that currently exists helps nobody. It creates unnecessary antagonism and anxiety at an already trying time for couples.""The proposed changes, which were leaked earlier this month, include making ""the irretrievable breakdown of a marriage"" the sole grounds for a divorce.It is also recommending removing the need to show evidence of a spouse's conduct, or a period of living apart. The 12-week consultation also proposes a new notification process where one, or possibly both parties, can simply notify the court of their intention to divorce, removing the opportunity for the other spouse to contest the divorce application.The changes would apply to both marriages and civil partnerships.Pressure for reform intensified after a woman's appeal for divorce was rejected by the Supreme Court in July due to her husband's refusal to split.Tini Owens, 68, wanted to divorce on the grounds she was unhappy but her husband of 40 years refused the split, leading the court to rule against her ""with reluctance"". That meant she must remain married until 2020 - as currently the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's agreement is to live apart for five years. Mr Gauke said the case had ""generated broader questions about what the law requires of people going through divorce and what it achieves in practice"". There had been a ""growing coalition recognising that the animosity that is put into this system is one that is not doing us any good,"" he said.Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon had previously urged the government to simply change the law rather than undertaking a consultation.Hannah Cornish, head of family law at Slater and Gordon, said there was a ""desperate need"" for reform.She added: ""Having to place blame can really inflame matters at what can already be a stressful and difficult time for a family.""Ministers also want views on the minimum time between the interim and final divorce decree in order to allow couples time to reflect and reach agreement on arrangements for the future if divorce is inevitable.  When you apply for a divorce you must prove your marriage has broken down and give one of the following five reasons:Source: Gov.UK"

On the first day of their four-day conference in Brighton, the Lib Dems will discuss the Windrush scandal, animal welfare and decentralisation among other issues.But the event is likely to be dominated by questions over the party's future direction, after Sir Vince - who will make his keynote speech on Tuesday - called for a major overhaul of its membership and election rules to counter claims it lacked popular appeal and was struggling to be heard. His proposals, which are likely to be debated but not voted on at this year's event, could allow people to join the party for free and non-members to vote in future leadership elections. Most controversially, he has floated the idea of future leadership contests being opened up to people who are not MPs. The party currently has 12 MPs and Sir Vince was elected unopposed last year.He told the Press Association that his party - which backs a referendum on the final Brexit deal - could provide a home to those ""fed up with the extremes of the current Conservative and Labour parties"".""Whether you see yourself as a liberal, social democrat, progressive, or centrist there is a home for you here, particularly as we fight Brexit together,"" he said.""I have made proposals to open up our movement to become an even more powerful force at the centre of British politics, standing up to power and privilege to bring fairness and opportunity for everyone.""The party said 10,000 people had pre-registered their interest to become party members since Sir Vince announced the proposals earlier this month.

On the face of it, it seems to have been extremely incompetent.""He told the BBC's Politics Live that if there was another EU referendum, which he wants to see, ""we need a rather more fit and proper body to be in charge of it"".The Electoral Commission said the High Court ""arrived at the same conclusion as the Commission did in its investigation - that Vote Leave should have accounted for the expenditure on the digital services firm, AggregateIQ - although it found an additional reason for reaching that conclusion"". The Commission's chief executive Claire Bassett said: ""The High Court has not ruled on the advice we gave to Vote Leave. Our advice was generic and covered hypothetical scenarios. ""At no point did we give any advice or discuss payments to Aggregate IQ. ""Suggestions made otherwise today on social media are categorically untrue.  ""Put simply, today's ruling states that donations from one campaign group to another are lawful, but that those donations must be declared as expenditure by the person or campaign group making the donation, if it is for a specific purpose. This is something that Vote Leave did not do.""In his judgement, Lord Justice Leggatt said the Electoral Commission had ""misinterpreted the definition of 'referendum expenses'"" as defined by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendum Act.He added: ""The source of its error is a mistaken assumption that an individual or body which makes a donation to a permitted participant cannot thereby incur referendum expenses.  ""As a result of this error, the Electoral Commission has interpreted the definition in a way that is inconsistent with both the language and the purpose of the legislation.""Vote Leave's donation to Mr Grimes, which went straight to its Canadian digital agency AggregateIQ, should have counted as part of Vote Leave's campaign expenses, added the judge. ""The position would have been different if the money had been given to Mr Grimes for him to use however he chose in promoting a 'leave' outcome of the referendum,"" he added.But the judge said there was no ""rational basis"" for the watchdog's actions, which he described a ""recipe for abuse"" of the law.Jolyon Maugham QC of the Good Law Project, which brought the High Court challenge, said the ruling proved the watchdog ""unlawfully tilted the playing field in favour of Leave"" in the 2016 referendum.""Stronger In (the official Remain campaign) was also up against its spending limits. ""But because it didn't get the advice from the Electoral Commission it had to stop spending. And the High Court decided that advice was wrong.""He said ""heads should roll"" at the Electoral Commission over the error.Matthew Elliott, former chief executive of Vote Leave, said the High Court ruling had ""thrown electoral law for future elections and referendums into total chaos"". ""Either the Electoral Commission is wrong or the High Court is wrong. ""Should the Electoral Commission choose not to appeal this judgment, they will be admitting that they gave Vote Leave incorrect advice and they should immediately reconsider the unfair fines they are seeking to impose on us,"" he added.""Vote Leave would not have made the donations that it did, had it not been for the Commission's clear advice. ""This whole situation is a mess of the Electoral Commission's own making, and their defeat in the High Court today must force a rethink. ""They now have a chance to rectify their errors. They should do the right thing.""  "
2018-09-16,I'll stand for leader if asked - Tory MP,https://web.archive.org//web/20180917030423/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45519604,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMP George Freeman has said he will put his name forward to be the next Tory leader if ""asked to"" amid continuing speculation over Theresa May's future.It comes after the ex-minister, who once chaired Mrs May's policy board, said there should be leadership contest next summer after Brexit was settled. He said he was ""no Michael Heseltine"" and would ""stand back"" if top figures from the ""next generation"" emerged.Mrs May has said she will serve as long as her party wants her to.Michael, now Lord, Heseltine launched a Conservative leadership challenge to Margaret Thatcher in 1990, triggering a contest won by John Major, after Lady Thatcher resigned as PM.Earlier this week, pro-Brexit MPs unhappy with Theresa May's Chequers blueprint for future co-operation with the EU openly discussed her future. This led to a backlash from senior figures such as Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith, who described leadership speculation as ""loose talk"" that should be stamped upon.  Downing Street has insisted there is no vacancy and the PM is focused on delivering the best outcome for the UK as it prepares to leave the EU this Spring. Negotiations on the terms of the UK's exit are entering their final stages, with both sides hoping for an agreement by the start of November at the latest.The UK and EU want to agree an outline statement on their future relations at the same time. By BBC political correspondent Jonathan BlakeIf you're thinking ""should I know who this guy is?"", don't worry, the answer - unless you're a keen Westminster watcher - is no. As George Freeman himself said - ""If I was still advising Theresa May..."" - which of course he isn't, having resigned as the chair of her policy board in November last year. But should the prime minister be worried? It's hard to ignore the fact that an MP has pointedly said in public that it is time for their leader to set a date for their departure. And this week others were slapped down by senior colleagues for expressing their frustration with Theresa May's leadership over Brexit. But if George Freeman has an organised campaign of supporters in Parliament, which he would need to be a serious contender, he is keeping it very well hidden. He also qualified his own leadership intention with the use of that key two letter word 'if' - ""If people want me to in Parliament, I will,"" he said. As one MP put it; ""I can't imagine who would ask him."" Ouch. But Tories who back a Canada-style trade deal with the EU have threatened to block the PM's Chequers plan, which proposes a much closer relationship, when the issue is voted on in Parliament in the autumn. Mr Freeman, who voted Remain in the 2016 referendum and was seen as ally of former leader David Cameron, quit as Mrs May's policy adviser in November last year over concerns about the direction of the party.He told BBC Radio Norfolk it should be up to a new leader to decide the UK's future relationship with the EU.The Mid-Norfolk MP said there should be a leadership contest next summer, lasting no more than three months, to determine the party's future direction, and he was prepared to throw his hat into the ring.""If the question is 'will I stand, the answer is if people want me to in Parliament, I will.""The next leader, he said, should come from the new crop of Tory politicians elected since 2010 - ""not the old faces"" as he described them - at least 10 of whom he suggested could do the job.""I would like to see the whole range of candidates stand. I would like a democratic Conservative Party choose the right leader. I'd like to see the nation see the breadth of talent we have"". But Mr Freeman indicated that he would not challenge Mrs May and would ""stand back and champion"" another candidate if they represented the ""right package of ideas"".""I did not sit down with a plan 20 years ago to become prime minister,"" he added.Mr Freeman said the advantage of having a contest next summer was that the issue of whether Brexit would happen would be settled by then and the party would, instead ""be debating where we take it"".And he said the Conservatives needed to focus on other issues, apart from Brexit and deficit, if they were to persuade young people that they were not ""technocratic, burnt-out and energy less"". Fellow Tory MP Tom Tugendhat has also called for ""a generational shift"" in the leadership of the party if and when Mrs May stands down. He told the Spectator: ""The vast majority of my generation wants to stop banging on about Europe. We want to talk about the optimism we feel in this country.' "

Then, many in the party felt that the existing top brass had passed their best, and the Conservatives needed fresh thinking and leadership. The slogan may have baggage, but more than a decade later, that question rather sums up why the suggestion from former minister George Freeman, on Thursday evening, that Theresa May should move on after March, can't be easily ignored. Very few Tory MPs want to say it publicly, but if they asked each other, ""Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"" many of them would confess, and admit privately in conversation that once the Brexit deal is done and we have left the EU in the spring, then Theresa May should make clear her intention not to fight the next election at a minimum.  Many believe that she should depart, or say that she is off almost immediately after that moment. Mr Freeman is not trying to push her out now and was effusive in praise for how she's managed so far. But his comments underline a widespread private assumption shared by many MPs and some ministers too - which of course may turn out to be wrong - that once the tortuous process of getting out of the EU is done, the best hope for the Tories of turning the page on the whole saga, is a new face at the helm. One senior MP, who is trying their best, for now, to keep the very rocky show on the road and who knows Theresa May well and has advised her many times told me: ""In March she's gone. Either she will have to set that out or people like me will tell her she has to go. ""If she doesn't say she's off, the letters will go in, and that will be it, so we can move on.""Some of the ministers seeking to make their mark have notions that they have a few months to do that before a potential contest. Remember, one of the big reasons that there hasn't been a leadership contest so far is that no wannabe wanted to take on the problems of Brexit. Once we have actually left, while many decisions and complexities will linger, the UK will have actually left, which should, in theory at least, create a space to change the political conversation. This is not about a handful of Brexiteers agitating to shove her out rudely because they don't like the direction of travel for the next few months. It's not about saying that there will be a sudden schism and they will crash into a leadership contest. But it's about a general sense across different wings of the Conservative Party, that Theresa May's time and political energy will have been run down by Brexit. Hold on for a minute. Politics is a rollercoaster - of course this is not inevitable. One government minister was furious this week when I asked about the very assumption that Mrs May could have less than a year in office, lambasting colleagues for discussing the subject, practically claiming that it's not a genuine topic of conversation. Another of her Cabinet allies told me tonight that ""if she delivers a good Brexit deal and the country is still moving forward, then Theresa May will still find herself in a very good position"", with the potential of leading the country and staying on for years to come. Certainly, time after time Theresa May has surprised and defied those who've tried to tear her down. What is the case though, is that many Tories have already made their minds up, that her time will be up within the next year. And in articulating his view publicly, Mr Freeman is saying what huge numbers of his colleagues have been thinking too. "
2018-09-16,'Not a forecast',https://web.archive.org//web/20180917030423/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45519309,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Governor of the Bank of England has always been clear about two things.That the present Brexit process has had negative effects on the broader economy and on people's incomes.And that a Brexit deal where there is no formal agreement between Britain and the European Union would make those effects worse.As Mark Carney said to me in an interview earlier this week to mark the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis, Brexit is one of the Big Four risks the Bank is facing.A debt crisis in China, problematically high household debt in the UK and a catastrophic cyber-attack taking out a whole bank are the others.""There are risks around Brexit for the financial sector,"" he told me.""And here's something that's changed with the system from 10 years ago - we are absolutely upfront about those risks, our view of those risks.""We have stress tested our banks against those risks to make sure they have enough of a safety net, both in terms of their own funds plus liquid funds, in case we had a no deal Brexit.""The key phrase is ""stress tested"".The Bank's Financial Policy Committee regularly sets ""doomsday scenarios"" to test the banking system's robustness in the face of a significant shock.The last stress test in November involved a scenario where house prices fell by 33%, interest rates rose to 4% and unemployment doubled.It became known as the ""no deal test"" and is remarkably close to the headlines we are seeing this morning.It appears that the Governor wasn't providing the Cabinet with a forecast of what the Bank believes would happen in the event of a no deal Brexit.He was briefing the Cabinet on what preparations the Bank was making if that does happen, including last November's stress test.It was not a forecast. It was an apocalyptic test where the Bank deliberately sets the parameters beyond what might reasonably be expected to occur.The major banks all passed the test, giving reassurance that the financial system can cope with whatever happens next year.The Governor believes that a ""no deal"" scenario would be bad for the economy.But not as bad as the headlines today which are based on a doomsday scenario that is not actually forecast to happen.There is another point that is often lost in the loudness of the negative headlines.If there is a ""good deal"" with the EU, Mr Carney believes there could be a significant boost to the economy as pent-up demand held back by the present uncertainty is released.Investment could rise markedly, he has argued.Those are the options as he sees them, and it is up to the politicians on both sides of the negotiation to come to a decision on which route they take."
2018-09-16,No-deal preparations,https://web.archive.org//web/20180917030423/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45514495,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA lot of hassle and potential cost for a lot of people. The government's spent the afternoon giving details of what might need to happen, if there was no deal with the EU.There's no guarantee you'd be able to avoid big phone bills if you use your mobile abroad, although ministers say they'd cap any data charges at Â£45 a month and some of the firms say they won't change prices. If you want to go on the road on the continent, you might need an International Driving Permit. If you want to jump on a cheap flight for a last-minute weekend, better check you have six months left on your passport, or you might be turned back.If there isn't a deal, many products tested in the UK after Brexit will have to go through the same process again - but with an EU authority in charge. The list of what might have to happen is a very long one. And some of the trickiest implications, like what would happen to planes flying between European and British skies, haven't even been published yet. And as the French foreign minister suggested, the Eurostar might not be able to run, and yes, planes may not be able to fly if a resolution can't be found. Publishing the papers are part of the government's plan to look like they are prepared for the potential shock and disruption of the negotiations failing. And indeed, for some in government, publicly detailing those preparations is part of a tactic to suggest that they have a way out and are ready to walk away, if Brussels doesn't budge. What ministers won't say, however, is how much money we might have to pay the EU if there were to be no deal. The Brexit secretary and the prime minister have both repeatedly said that the estimated price tag of nearly Â£40bn if there is a deal would not be paid in full. But they refuse point blank to give an assessment of how much it would be, if we walked away without an agreement. The reality is the cost would probably still be many billions, and it would take lawyers many, many years to be able to agree on it. In that situation, the government would be walking away without being able to tell MPs or the public how much we would still have to stump up. Ministers' belief, however, is that the chances of there being no agreement are now relatively small. They are hopeful that next week EU leaders will give helpful hints at a special meeting in Salzburg. On Thursday, the Brexit secretary told me he believes the EU will meet the UK ""half way"" on the Irish border issue, which for many many months has been the trickiest issue of all.Yet there is a long way to go until he, or anyone in government, can be sure. And don't doubt that many Tory MPs are adamant they simply won't vote for the kind of proposal Theresa May has put on the table. One senior MP told me: ""If people in Number 10 haven't made clear to her that 'Chequers minus minus' isn't going to get through the Commons, then she is getting the wrong advice."" After all, there are two kinds of ""no deal"" - one seems very unlikely, where the EU and the UK simply can't agree. The prime minister comes back to Parliament and says: ""I'm sorry, I tried, but it just won't wash.""But the other is that Theresa May comes back with a deal but her party, and Parliament, chucks it out. The political climate would be different in those two cases. But in the potential chaos of either, the hassle outlined on Thursday might just be the start. "

There is massive frustration with her leadership, her position on Chequers and the way her proposals tuck the UK closely into the EU in perpetuity. And yes, there are some MPs who want to see her gone immediately. However senior voices in the European Research Group - yes them - are adamant that it is not the time to try to oust the PM. It would be ""stupid"", one told me last night. Imagine in these critical weeks of the Brexit negotiations if the UK started to try to change the prime minister. Right now those jostling to remove her know they don't have any guarantees they would have the numbers to force her out, even though they may well be able to pull together enough MPs to submit letters to the chair of 1922 committee to trigger a contest.So are the Eurosceptics coldly gaming the options for how to get their way? Does that include discussing if, when and how, they could try to push the prime minister out of office? Absolutely. But does it mean we are on the verge of a coup being launched against Number 10? Things can change very fast these days. But don't be so sure."
2018-09-16,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180917030423/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45488124,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA group of Tory MPs has endorsed a plan for a ""clean break"" from the European Union (EU), with the UK defaulting to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules when it leaves the EU. The proposals are contained in a report by the pressure group Economists for Free Trade (EFT). Here's an initial look at a few of the claims they've made. These figures are based on a number of calculations and assumptions, not all of which stand up to scrutiny. Those who have modelled a clean Brexit properly, the EFT asserts, report long-term gains from free trade of 2%-4% of GDP. The report dismisses alternative modelling - done by the Treasury and by Whitehall's Cross Departmental Brexit Analysis - which arrived at very different conclusions. But that is part of the problem. The EFT are convinced that they are the only people who have modelled the data correctly - even though theirs is a minority view.""The vast majority of economists think it will be different,"" says Prof Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex.""Because a hard Brexit will cut trade with the EU, which is by far our largest trading partner, significantly.""Chequers plan 'worse than status quo'What is the 'no deal' WTO option?Last year the UK exported almost Â£274bn in goods and services to the EU, compared with Â£112bn to the US. When it comes to imports, the UK imported Â£341bn in goods and services from the EU and Â£70bn from the US.  For those who love the detail, here is one example of economists who criticise the EFT's methodology. Tory supporters of Brexit are, however, unbowed: ""Perhaps it's our fault,"" says leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, ""by not putting the argument for a world trade deal earlier, we left the running to people who don't want us to leave the EU at all.""The EFT report also says the UK would no longer have to pay a net amount of Â£12bn to the EU every year, although that figure appears to be slightly inflated.According to the Treasury net payments to the EU amounted to Â£9.6bn in 2016 and Â£8.9bn in 2017. Forecasts over the next five years suggest that - if the UK were to stay in the EU - net payments to the EU would rise to roughly Â£11bn a year.The EFT report goes on to  suggests that the UK could choose to withhold ""most or all"" of the estimated Â£39bn financial settlement that the government has provisionally agreed to pay the EU as part of a Withdrawal Agreement. In theory, the UK could do that, but it would probably prompt a legal challenge from the EU, and it would certainly damage relations severely at a time when - as the EFT report suggests - the government would be looking for co-operation in a whole series of policy areas. It says only 4% of goods arriving in the UK from non-EU countries are subject to checks, and it suggests that trade with the EU in future could therefore be almost as seamless as it is now.  It's correct that very few physical or documentary checks are carried out on non-EU goods. But evidence given to the Home Affairs Select Committee suggests that things are rather more complicated than that. If a lorry arrives at Dover, for example, from a non-EU country, it is usually delayed by 60 to 90 minutes even if no checks are made. The UK could choose to speed up that process and abolish many checks, but there would still be far more checks on UK goods being exported to the EU via Dover. There would also be further complications for UK exports. Once the UK is designated as a third country by the EU, all UK exports of animal origin would only be able to enter EU territory via a veterinary border inspection post, where there are often time-consuming physical inspections as well as documentary checks. Neither the Eurotunnel nor the Calais port is currently designated as a veterinary border inspection post. The EFT report says that under WTO rules sanitary and phytosanitary measures (ie safety checks on food) can't be used as a ""surreptitious means of inhibiting cross-border trade"". This is true, but that does not erase what are known as non-tariff-barriers entirely, it simply reduces inspections where possible. ""The only countries that have managed to remove the need for health checks on food being exported to the EU,"" says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform, ""are the European Economic Area members and Switzerland. They have not only implemented EU rules in this area domestically, they also apply EU checks on all imports of animal origin entering from the rest of the world."" The EFT report also suggests lifting tariffs (or import charges) on imported goods to make prices cheaper. It recognises that if you do that for one country, you have to do it for every country, under WTO rules. If tariffs were removed for all agricultural produce, cheap imports would flood in and food prices would fall - but the UK farming industry could be decimated. So, the report says, that ""perhaps the most attractive goods to target"" might be ones that we don't produce in the UK at all. It mentions oranges as one example, but it would be a pretty limited number of goods.  Again, others are extremely sceptical about the EFT's policy proposals. According to a report published earlier this year by the House of Lords European Union Committee, ""EU food imports cannot easily be replaced by either producing more in the UK or importing more from non-EU countries"". The Lords report forecast that food prices were likely to rise without a Brexit deal. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.3%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-16,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180917030423/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

It's rhetoric, not reality, and it can't be allowed to happen.""But Mrs May said it was the government's job to ""make sure we make a success of no-deal, just as we make a success of getting a good deal.""Her comments were in response to questioning about the Bank of England's governor Mark Carney's warning that a no-deal Brexit could see house prices crash by more than a third. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund has said the UK economy will shrink without a Brexit deal.In its annual assessment of the UK economy, the IMF said that all likely Brexit scenarios would ""entail costs"", but a disorderly departure could lead to ""a significantly worse outcome"".Chancellor Philip Hammond said the government had to listen to the IMF's ""clear warnings"".The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations between the two sides are still taking place.Mrs May set out her proposals for the key issue of cross-border trade after a Chequers summit in July, but it has been fiercely criticised by some Brexiteers who say plans for a ""common rulebook"" on goods would compromise the UK's sovereignty.Speaking to Panorama, Mrs May said that if Parliament does not ratify the Chequers plan ""I think that the alternative to that will be having no deal"".BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Theresa May calculated that faced with a ""binary choice"" of the Chequers deal or no deal, Brexiteers would not have the ""chutzpah to say 'no way'"" and Remainers would decide that carrying on fighting the plan would be too risky.But the risks are that the PM cannot say for certain what the final deal will look like - and some Brexiteers were already determined not to vote for it, she added.Mr Johnson's column in Monday's Daily Telegraph renewed his attack on the Chequers proposals and the government's plans for avoiding new border checks on the Northern Irish border.He criticised the UK's decision to agree with the EU on the need for a ""backstop"" to avoid a hard border irrespective of a trade deal, saying the issue was being used ""to coerce the UK into becoming a vassal state of Brussels"".Downing Street responded by saying Mr Johnson had been part of the government that signed up to the backstop plan.In her Panorama interview, Mrs May said there needed to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland, in order to avoid a hard border there.Last week a group of Brexiteer Tory MPs said a hard border could be avoided by using ""established"" technology and ""modifying"" existing arrangements.Mr Johnson refers to the suggestions by the European Research Group in his column, saying that ""extra checks done away from the border"" would prevent the need for physical checks when vehicles move between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.But Mrs May insisted that any system of checks was ""still a hard border"". ""You don't solve the issue of no hard border by having a hard border 20km inside Ireland,"" she said.Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Nick Clegg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was an ""insult to the intelligence of British voters"" for the prime minister to say it was a ""choice between either the Chequers fudge or a cataclysmic cliff edge"".Speaking later at a fringe event at the Lib Dem conference in Brighton, Sir Nick claimed European leaders were ""seeking to find some way of giving Britain more time"" to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told LBC the prime minister should ""try a bit harder"" to get a better deal.Please upgrade your browserMrs May has found herself embattled with some in her party, after about 50 European Research Group Tory MPs openly discussed how and when they could force her to stand down as prime minister.On Sunday Brexit-supporting Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the Chequers plan was the right one ""for now"".He told the BBC a future prime minister could alter the relationship between the UK and the EU.Mrs May will attempt to persuade EU leaders of the merits of her plans at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday.With nearly six months to go until exit from the EU on 29 March 2019, a poll commissioned by BBC Radio 5 Live suggests that the UK remains split over whether Brexit will be positive for the UK. According to a Comres survey, 50% of British adults feel the overall impact will be negative, whereas 41% think it will be positive. When asked about the handling of Brexit negotiations, almost 79% of people polled thought that the government had handled them badly, and 63% thought the EU had handled them badly.The People's Vote campaign, meanwhile, claimed a ""fresh wave"" of 18-year-olds becoming eligible to vote was ""transforming the dynamics of the Brexit debate"" because they mostly back staying in the EU.BBC Panorama, Inside No 10: Deal or No Deal? is on Monday 17 September at 20:30 BST on BBC One as part of a week of in-depth coverage across the BBC to mark Brexit: Six Months to Go."

The Lib Dem leader will call on Theresa May to ""shock us all"" and back a referendum on the Brexit deal she strikes with Brussels.Mrs May has ruled out another referendum ""under any circumstances"".The prime minister told the BBC that MPs would have a choice between her proposed deal with the EU - the so-called Chequers plan - or no deal at all, ahead of the UK's departure on 29 March.Sir Vince has rejected this choice, arguing that there are ""better alternatives"", and vowed to do everything he can to stop Brexit in Parliament.He will say he is ""starting to feel sorry"" for Mrs May who is ""dutifully delivering a policy she doesn't really believe in"".And he will urge her to admit Brexit has ""gone badly wrong"" and ""open her mind"" to another public vote.The Lib Dem leader is part of the cross-party People's Vote campaign for another referendum and claims support for it is growing, although he has put its chance of success at about ""30%"".In his big speech to the party conference in Brighton, Sir Vince will say it ""beggars belief that the army and the police are now being asked to prepare for riots in the chaotic aftermath of a botched Brexit"".Taking aim at Conservative Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg, he will say: ""For the 'true believers' - the fundamentalists - the costs of Brexit have always been irrelevant.""Years of economic pain justified by the erotic spasm of leaving the European Union.""Economic pain felt - of course - not by them by those least able to afford it.""Of his former coalition cabinet colleague Theresa May, he will say: ""She is dutifully delivering a policy she doesn't really believe in; failing in negotiations; losing public support; and all to appease a dwindling group of angry people in her party who will denounce her as a traitor, whatever she comes up with.""But when we feel sorry for the country's prime minister, something is seriously wrong.""Our sympathy can only extend so far, while she puts the interests of the country second to the whims of the extremists in her party.""He will claim that Mrs May, who voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum but has vowed to deliver on the will of the people, knows ""deep down"" that Brexit is a ""bad idea"" whose ""time has gone"".He will urge her to show ""true leadership"" by admitting that staying in the EU will be better than any deal she can get in Brussels.""Instead of kowtowing to her enemies in the Conservative Party, she could lead her party and the country by opening her mind to a 'People's Vote' on the final deal,"" he will say. Sir Vince is also expected to take aim at the Labour leadership, who have so far resisted his calls to get behind another EU referendum, in his keynote address to party members.The Lib Dem leader, who has said he will step down when Brexit has been ""resolved or stopped"",  is talking to those Labour and Conservative MPs, who do back another referendum, about how to get their way in Parliament.He has also set out plans to transform his party, which has 12 MPs and has languished in the opinion polls since being in coalition with the Tories, into a ""movement for moderates"" and open up its next leadership contest to non-MPs.But anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller, who praised the party's efforts to fight Brexit in a speech from the main stage on Monday, ruled out joining the party or standing for leader."

2018-09-17,Brexit report to consider workforce impact,https://web.archive.org//web/20180918053718/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45556246,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe cap on the number of high-skilled migrants coming to the UK should be scrapped, according to a key report commissioned by the government ahead of Brexit.The Migration Advisory Committee says these workers make a more positive contribution to the public finances. It suggests EU workers should be subject to the same visa rules as other migrants.But it notes the UK might offer them special status under a Brexit deal.The government has said it will ""carefully consider"" the committee's proposals. Labour has backed the report, calling for an ""end to discrimination"" against non-EU migrants.  ""If immigration is not part of the negotiations with the EU and the UK is deciding its future system in isolation, there should be no preference given to EU citizens,"" the report says.It says it sees no ""compelling reasons to offer a different set of rules"" for workers from the EEA.""A migrant's impact depends on factors such as their skills, employment, age and use of public services, and not fundamentally on their nationality,"" it says. Prime Minister Theresa May has repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility of offering different rules for EU workers as part of negotiations to secure a trade deal with the bloc after the UK leaves in March 2019.The committee - made up of independent experts - says its research focused on ""a desirable migration system for the UK if it was to be set in isolation"" from Brexit negotiations. This, it says, should not be read as a recommendation that immigration should therefore be excluded from such talks. The report goes on to say there is no evidence that increased European migration has damaged life in the UK. It concludes that EU migrants pay more in tax than they receive in benefits, contribute more to the NHS workforce than the healthcare they access, and have no effect on crime rates. MAC chairman Professor Alan Manning said the overall the impacts of EEA migration had not had the ""big costs that some people claim"", but it had not had ""big benefits"" either.The report says the impact of all EEA migration to the UK since 2004 was almost certainly less than that of the fall in the value of the pound following the referendum vote, which probably raised prices by 1.7%. The EEA consists of all EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondentMinisters commissioned this report because they needed clear facts on the role of European workers in the country - and the implications of ending their freedom of movement. But it's too soon to know how many of the committee's recommendations will be adopted because of the Brexit elephant in the room.So while the experts want no special immigration deal for future EU workers (the report does not concern those who are already living in the UK), it doesn't consider whether a special deal would be good or bad for Britain.Such a deal is a possibility. The prime minister's Chequers plan proposes a ""mobility framework"" - a system allowing British and EU citizens to study and work in each other countries, potentially linked to a trade deal.So if the ministers offer special access for future EU workers, in return for something they want for the UK, this report won't help us know whether it is worth it. The MAC was asked to do the research in July 2017 by then Home Secretary Amber Rudd and is widely expected to shape the government's post-Brexit immigration policy. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May might start ""sketching out"" her plans for this at October's Conservative Party conference.He added that the report would increase pressure on her to not compromise on freedom of movement during the Brexit negotiations. Please upgrade your browserThe report recommends ""a less restrictive regime for higher-skilled workers than for lower-skilled workers"", adding: ""Higher-skilled workers tend to have higher earnings so make a more positive contribution to the public finances.""Current policy is to allow 20,700 high-skilled workers into the UK each year from outside the EEA.They are granted a Tier 2 visa to work in the country. Top priority is given to jobs on a ""shortage occupation list"" which can be found here.Examples include:Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers?The committee says it is ""not convinced there needs to be a work route for low-skilled workers"" from the EU to fill jobs in industries such as catering or hospitality.It says some sectors will ""complain vociferously"", but it believes the number of existing low-skilled migrants will not change immediately.The ""possible exception"" to this rule could be for seasonal agriculture, where 99% of the workers come from EU countries. The government says it will listen to the report and put in an immigration system that works for the whole of the UK. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""The government is clear that EU citizens play an important and positive role in our economy and society and we want that to continue after we leave.""Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said the UK's immigration policy ""needs to be based on our economic needs, while meeting our legal obligations and treating people fairly"".""[This] means ending the discrimination against non-EU migrants, especially from the Commonwealth,"" she added. The report was welcomed by the Royal College of Nursing, which said: ""The UK has long depended on nursing professionals from around the world and any future cap on their numbers would leave health and social care services unable to recruit the nurses they need."" But Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the report was ""puzzling"" with ""significant gaps"" between the MAC's research and recommendations. ""The MAC admit they have ignored the crucial relationship between immigration and trade,"" she said. Without analysis on relationship between trade & immigration, and on how to address impact on key sectors like social care, Parliament & Govt still doesnât have the info it needs to inform the negotiations & future plansEnd of Twitter post  by @YvetteCooperMPAnd London Mayor Sadiq Khan said it was a ""missed opportunity"" to protect the UK from the government's ""mishandled approach to Brexit"" and the ""economically illiterate migration target"", warning that British businesses will pay the price ""if the government fails to protect their access to a European workforce"".The Scottish government's migration minister, Ben Macpherson, said the report had done ""little to consider Scotland's needs"" and ""fails to address"" Scottish employers' concerns - especially in the tourism and agriculture sectors- about access to workforce. Meanwhile, Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said if the recommendations were adopted, it would signal ""the biggest change to the UK labour market in a generation"" and would represent a ""huge shift"" for sectors such as hotels and food manufacturing.He said: ""If enacted, these proposals would effectively end low-skilled migration, while prioritising mid- and high-skill migration in areas where we have labour shortages. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the report was ""blind to the impact"" of EU migration to a number of communities. He said the proposals would ""permit continued high levels of immigration"" and ""the overall outcome would be to weaken immigration control"".The report comes as figures for 2017, showed that net migration from the EU was at its lowest level since 2012 - with overall net migration at 282,000.The government wants to cut overall net migration to the tens of thousands.The MAC analysed the impact of migration from the EEA, taking evidence from more than 400 businesses, industry bodies and government departments."

2018-09-17,MP told to stop giving CPR to stabbed PC,https://web.archive.org//web/20180918053718/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45546867,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAn MP who fought to save the life of PC Keith Palmer during last year's Westminster terror attack has told an inquest how a doctor ordered him to stop giving CPR. Tobias Ellwood rushed to help PC Palmer after he was stabbed by Khalid Masood on 22 March.But a doctor told Mr Ellwood, ""you've done your best"", and PC Palmer died. After almost breaking down in court, the MP said: ""[We] closed the eyes and then I said 'I'm sorry'.""Mr Ellwood said that if he had taken his normal route into Parliament, he would have been closer to Masood as he launched the attack.""I know I would have stepped forward and I regret not having the opportunity to do so,"" he added.Four other people died after Masood drove into them on Westminster Bridge. The inquest into the deaths of PC Palmer, 48, Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, is taking place at the Old Bailey in London. An inquest into the death of Masood - who was shot dead by armed officers during the attack - will take place afterwards. Mr Ellwood - Conservative MP for Bournemouth East and a medically trained former Army officer - told the court he was in a meeting close by when the attack occurred. He said he heard a crash followed by screams, adding: ""These were not screams of pain... these were screams of shock."" After running through crowds of people with ""panic in their eyes"" and hearing shots fired, Mr Ellwood said he saw a number of police officers crouched near Carriage Gate - which leads to New Palace Yard, outside the Houses of Parliament - and PC Palmer and Masood on the floor.He said the three officers helping PC Palmer looked like they needed assistance, so he ran towards them.They told him he was risking his life because of the chance of a secondary attack, but the MP - whose brother died in the Bali attack in 2002 - told the court: ""My brother was killed in a secondary attack... so I was very aware of that.""I was concerned about what would happen if things were to ratchet up, but my immediate concern was that we had somebody who was clearly badly bleeding and needed assistance.""Mr Ellwood said PC Palmer was unconscious, but that he still had a pulse, telling the court: ""I was encouraged that we'd arrived on the scene early enough to do something.""But PC Palmer's heart stopped, and Mr Ellwood had to begin chest compressions while someone else gave the officer mouth-to-mouth.""By this time the whole of Westminster was very silent,"" he said. A medical team arrived by helicopter and moved PC Palmer so they could operate on him in the courtyard.Mr Ellwood had to pause in the witness box, before saying: ""Forgive me, it's sometimes easier to do the helping rather than to talk about it afterwards.""Despite their efforts, the doctor said there was nothing more they could do.Mr Ellwood said: ""I told a doctor present 'you're going to have to order me to stop', and the medic said, 'Sir, you've done your best, but you do need to stop'.""We both covered the body as best we could, closed the eyes and I said: 'I'm sorry.'""It was a very strange end to a very traumatic four or five minutes, to suddenly be left completely alone with just one other person.""Dr Antony Hudson from London's Helicopter Emergency Medical Service, who performed the surgery on PC Palmer, told the court it would have been ""nearly impossible to return a cardiac output"" to a patient in that condition.By Helena Lee, BBC News correspondent, at the Old BaileyTobias Ellwood came to Court One at the Old Bailey today to give evidence - not as an MP, but as a man who tried to help save the life of a dying police officer.He stood in the witness box for nearly an hour, at times with his hands gripped onto the oak-panelled sides.His voice, calm and measured, set against the ""screams of shock"" and ""panic in peoples eyes"" which he described. He paused every so often as the memories of that day came back. As he began describing the surgery carried out on PC Palmer on the ground, he stopped talking and stayed silent for some seconds. When Mr Ellwood finished his evidence, the barrister for PC Palmer's widow thanked him for his efforts to help the officer. Despite his harrowing experience, Mr Ellwood called on other members of the public to ""step forward"" in the face of terrorist incidents.He told the court: ""I know the official advice is to step back, report it.""[But] I find myself countering that somewhat, because if more of us do step forward as we saw in the Manchester attack - London Bridge and Westminster Bridge as well - the message gets through that no terrorist is going to win.""Asked by the lawyer representing PC Palmer's widow, Michelle, about security in Westminster, Mr Ellwood said there had always been a ""sense of vulnerability"" around the Houses of Parliament and that, at times, there had been less firearms protection at the site than he would have liked.But he did not want it to become ""a tower of protection"", as it would ""change the face of what Parliament is about"".The MP added: ""[With] the level of security we have in place [now], I'm not sure we could do more."""
2018-09-17,Labour: Ban early baby sex tests,https://web.archive.org//web/20180918053718/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-45497454,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour is calling for a ban on parents-to-be being told the sex of their baby after early blood tests, amid fears it may lead to abortions of girls.The Non-Invasive Prenatal Test (NIPT) is used by the NHS to test for genetic conditions, but people can pay for it privately to discover a baby's sex.Labour MP Naz Shah said it was morally wrong for people to use the test to abort pregnancies based on the outcome.The Department of Health said it would continue to review the evidence. An investigation by the Victoria Derbyshire programme has found thousands of British women discussing using NIPT to determine sex on an online forum.Ms Shah, who is shadow women and equalities minister, said cultural practices in some communities like the South Asian community, have a preference for boys. She said this put great strain on women ""forcing them to adopt methods such as NIPT to live up to expectations of family members"". NIPT involves taking a sample from the woman to look for DNA from the baby circulating in her blood, to gauge the risk of possible genetic conditions such as Down's syndrome. It can also be used to determine sex, information which NHS doctors will not be sharing with parents when the test is rolled out across England next month. Private clinics offer the same test for around Â£150-Â£200 and do share this information. Some require only that a drop of blood be sent in the post with results sent back in a few days. Ms Shah said: ""NIPT screenings should be used for their intended purpose, to screen for serious conditions such as Down's syndrome.""The government needs to look into this exploitative practice and enforce appropriate restrictions.""'I had a panic attack when they said it was a girl'Zara, not her real name, is Sikh and lives in Greater London.""I had straightaway made that decision that I didn't want to have this baby.""We were a family of five girls and every time my Mum had another daughter everyone would come to the house as if they were coming to mourn. ""For them it's like a burden. My fear was I didn't want to go through what my mother went through.""Zara discovered the sex of her baby five months into her pregnancy and opted to have a surgical abortion.    She now regrets the decision. ""You see friends and family that have daughters and they have such a lovely relationship. I'm someone's daughter and someone's sister,"" she said. Zara says she believes abortion on the grounds of sex is a ""very common"" practice. Rani Bilkhu from the Jeena International organisation says many women say they have suffered violence or been coerced into abortions because they were pregnant with a second or third girl. It wants sex-selective abortion to be viewed as a form of honour-based violence. ""No wonder they're resorting to sex-selection abortion because they've got no choice,"" she says. ""They don't want to be homeless, they don't want their marriage to fail - all because they couldn't give birth to a boy.""The online forums where British women discussed using NIPT include thousands of posts where women express their anxiety about having a girl. One said: ""I need a son to heal me... my only bet is NIPT followed by continuation, only if it's a boy.""The programme also found one area, Slough, where women's clinics offering these tests were being promoted on roadside adverts.""This poster is really telling the community, 'Come here, come to us and we'll let you know whether you're having a boy or a girl,'"" says Ms Bilkhu.Labour MP for Slough, Tan Dhesi, said marketing tests offering sex determination should be stamped out. ""Communities in South Asia have made huge strides in tackling this social evil,"" he said. ""That's been primarily through legislation, banning gender determination clinics. In the UK I think we need to be doing likewise, with regards to the private sector as well.""Choosing an abortion due to sex is illegal in the UK, apart from some rare exemptions, but it is difficult to detect as women often cite other reasons for having the procedure.In 2015, the government acknowledged it did not know how widespread testing for sex was. It said if NIPT became more popular, it would need to analyse the impact it was having on the gender ratio in ethnic minority communities.Ms Bilkhu said it was extremely hard to measure. ""Not only do the government not understand there's an issue around sex-selection abortion, but also charities and statutory sectors aren't asking the questions,"" she said. The Nuffield Council, which advises on ethical issues, recently held a consultation on NIPT testing. It believes the ability to determine sex reinforces pressure on women to have boys. ""The desire for sex-selection is a major driver of private-sector testing,"" said Tom Shakespeare from the council. ""I don't think the government want to regulate, they just don't like it in any sector. ""But countries like China and India have recognised the problem of sex-selective abortion and so it's very difficult to get this information - in India it is illegal.  So if we allow it, people will come here as tourists.""A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""The pre-natal test is never meant to be used for determining the sex of a child. We will continue to review the evidence.""Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel in the UK."
2018-09-17,May trying to 'intimidate' MPs over Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180918053718/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45546370,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May is trying to ""intimidate"" Tory MPs into voting for her version of Brexit, Sir Vince Cable has claimed.The Lib Dem leader told the BBC he did not accept the choice the prime minister was offering of an exit based on her Chequers agreement or no deal. He said time was not a barrier to a referendum on the final Brexit deal as this could be agreed in ""a few weeks"".Asked about how long he would carry on as leader, he said he would be ""very busy for quite a long time"".Sir Vince has said he will step down as leader once Brexit is resolved or stopped, prompting speculation that his keynote address on Tuesday will be his last as Lib Dem leader.On Brexit, he said there was a ""growing demand"" for what campaigners are calling a People's Vote on the outcome of the current negotiations with the EU. He suggested a ballot - in which the public would be asked to choose between any deal reached by the government and remaining in the European Union - could be arranged within weeks. ""Time isn't an enormous problem,"" he told BBC News. ""They can set up a people's vote within a relatively short time frame. I would hope in a few weeks, but overall we need more time for this anyway. ""The government, he said, had ""backed itself against the wall"" and the EU would agree ""if asked"" to extend the Article 50 process which sets a time limit on Britain's membership ""to give more breathing space.""The prime minister, he suggested, was trying to coerce her MPs into voting for her preferred version of Brexit by warning that the only alternative was leaving without a deal. ""She is posing the question in the way she wants to pose it and she's trying to intimidate a lot of her own backbenchers who are deeply unhappy about the way Brexit's going.""Sir Vince said his proposed shake-up of the party - which sees people join for free and non-MPs allowed to stand to become leader - were ""not about survival"" but bringing people to the party who were alienated by ""extremists"" taking over Labour and the Conservatives. ""I want us to survive as a massive political force and to bring in the very large number of people who are extremely alienated and frustrated because they see the extremists taking over the two main parties,"" he said.""We've got to make ourselves welcoming and successful.""Asked if he would miss being party leader when he finally stood down, Sir Vince said he had set out a ""series of tasks to perform"" in the near future, relating to Brexit, local elections and his proposed shake-up of the party. ""'I'm going to be very busy for quite a long time,"" he said. "

Ms Miller has ruled out an ""official"" career in politics but, on Friday, launched a personal campaign to ""let the people decide for themselves"" on Brexit.The investment manager has been a prominent figure in the Brexit debate since successfully winning a legal challenge in 2017 which forced the government to get Parliamentary consent before giving notice of its intention to leave the EU under the Article 50 process. The BBC's Brian Wheeler in BrightonShe doesn't want to lead their party, or even join it, but Lib Dem members seem to love Gina Miller anyway.""I think it was amazing,"" said Emmanuel de Kadt, a Lib Dem member from Brighton, ""There was a bigger ovation for a non-member than anybody else so far.""Riccardo Macuso, from Reading, hailed her ""extreme bravery"" in the face of ""very aggressive"" right-wing opposition. ""If we end up with somebody like Gina Miller (as leader) in the future it would not be such a bad thing,"" he added.Former MP Michael Meadowcroft said it was an  ""extremely well-judged"" speech, just the kind of oratory that Lib Dems love. But, he added, ""you cannot lead a party from outside Westminster"".She told the conference in Brighton that she was not a member of the party and has no ambition of succeeding Sir Vince.""I speak to you as a friend and someone who feels a bond with you on many issues... but I am not addressing you as leader-in-waiting"" she said.""I want to see the Lib Dems thrive because, in a health democracy, we need a strong third party, every bit as much as we need a strong opposition and, for that matter, a strong government and prime minister.""She said the Lib Dems' ""reasonable, sensible, conciliatory"" approach to Brexit needed to be heard, more than ever, with about six months to go until the UK leaves on 29 March 2019.""We need statesmen and women doing what they genuinely believe is right for the country - not just reflecting society but shaping it.""None of us is going to be forgiven by these future generation if we tell them we decided just to sit this particular national crisis out, just waited to see what would happen, felt there was nothing we could do or, worse, stayed silent and hoped others would sort out the chaos."" On Friday, Ms Miller - who it is understood will not be speaking at either the Labour or Conservative conferences - launched a personal campaign providing ""unspun facts"" about the choices facing the UK and the different plans put forward by MPs.Although she has not specifically come out in support of the People's Vote campaign for another referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, she said it was ""time for politicians to do the morally and democratically right thing to let the people decide their own future on the facts before it is too late"". The People's Vote campaign has gained momentum in recent months, with leading unions and a growing number of Labour and Conservative MPs backing it.But Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out another vote, insisting the UK has a choice between her Chequers plan and leaving without a deal. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn has said another referendum is not party policy, with a general election the party's favoured option.Speaking in a Brexit debate on Monday, former Lib Dem leader Lord Campbell said a new referendum was ""not a privilege for which we have to beg... it is a right"" that people were entitled to.Remaining in the EU would help the UK and Europe ""stand up to the bullying"" of US President Donald Trump and the aggression of Vladimir Putin's Russia, he added.

The British Home Secretary said the two nations would share evidence to enable more prosecutions to be brought.Prime Minister Imran Khan has promised to bring back money he alleges has been ""stolen"" and invested or hidden abroad. Although there have been ad hoc extraditions from the UK in the past, no formal legal arrangements exist. Earlier this year the former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was sentenced to 10 years in jail for failing to explain where the money came from to buy four flats in central London. Two of his sons and the former Pakistani Finance Minister are currently living in the UK, but are wanted for trial on corruption charges in Pakistan. Mr Sharif, his family and former Finance Minister Ishaq Dar have always denied the allegations, and dismissed them as a political conspiracy. On a visit to Islamabad, where he held talks with Mr Khan, Mr Javid refused to talk about ""individual cases"" but told the BBC that the government took the issue of corruption ""very seriously."" He told reporters at a news conference that he had not discussed specific amounts of money suspected of being laundered in the UK, or measures that could be taken to recover them, but the two countries would be cooperating to boost accountability and to ensure that ""no-one escapes justice or acts with impunity"". Mr Javid said a new envoy to Pakistan would be appointed to liaise on the issue with a Pakistani counterpart.  Mr Khan swept to power earlier this year on an anti-corruption platform.Shahzad Akbar, the Special Assistant to the Pakistani Prime Minister on Accountability, told reporters that the decision to request Mr Dar's extradition would have to be first made by the country's anti-corruption court. Mr Javid, whose parents emigrated to Britain from Pakistan in the 1960s, is making the first visit to the country by a British minister since last year's general election. He told the BBC that Pakistan was one of the UK's ""most important bilateral relationships"" but he wanted to improve cooperation on security. During a visit to a girls' school earlier in the day, Mr Javid - tipped by some as a future prime minister - told pupils: ""whilst I am very proud to be British, Pakistan has a very special place in my heart and always will"". Asked whether a British Pakistani could become prime minister, Mr Javid replied that ""in today's Britain it doesn't matter where you come from. As long as you're willing to put in the effort you can achieve anything"",  before adding that he ""loved"" being home secretary. "

He said the party's 12 MPs - with one exception - were ""solid"" in their determination to stop Brexit.Stephen Lloyd MP voted Remain but has vowed to respect the wishes of his Leave-voting Eastbourne constituents.Mr Cable said he hoped to persuade Mr Lloyd to change his mind before the ""meaningful"" vote promised to MPs on the terms of any Brexit deal.Downing Street believes it can get Mrs May's Chequers plan - which would see the UK obeying single market rules for goods after Brexit - through Parliament, despite opposition from many Conservative MPs.Mr Cable, who was business secretary in David Cameron's coalition government, said the Chequers deal had an ""enormous hole in it"" because it did not include services - which make up 80% of the British economy.The Chequers plan was a ""second best solution"" to the issue of frictionless trade in goods but was based on a ""very, very complicated mechanism,"" he added.And Mr Cable said he could not vote for it even if the government claimed the only alternative was a no deal Brexit because there are ""better alternatives"".Sir Vince, who is campaigning for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said: ""We're absolutely solid that we need to vote against Brexit and stop it.""In other  conference developments:Speaking at an earlier meeting, Mr Cable warned the world economy ""could well"" be heading for a serious crash within the ""next 18 months to two years"".The Lib Dem leader - who famously predicted the 2008 financial crash - warned about ""dangerously high"" levels of debt in the UK economy.And it was ""difficult to see"" major economies coming together to tackle any crisis as they did in 2008 with the current political climate, he added.The Lib Dem leader is also calling for the creation of a  Â£100bn ""citizens fund"" to protect the UK from future economic crises by bolstering the public finances.The fund could be built up through taxes on the rich and the sale of state assets, such as the UK stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, he argues."

The IMF said that all likely Brexit scenarios would ""entail costs"", but a disorderly departure could lead to ""a significantly worse outcome"".The challenges in getting a deal done remained ""daunting"", it said.The IMF expects Britain's economy to grow by 1.5% in both 2018 and 2019 if a broad Brexit agreement is struck. The predictions came in the IMF's latest annual assessment of the UK economy.Christine Lagarde, the IMF's managing director, told a news conference at the Treasury in London: ""Those projections assume a timely deal with the EU on a broad free trade agreement and a relatively orderly Brexit process after that.""Any deal will not be as good as the smooth process under which goods, services, people and capital move around between the EU and the UK without impediments and obstacles.""The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, said the government must listen to the IMF's ""clear warnings"".He added: ""The IMF are clear today that no deal would be extremely costly for the UK as it would also for the EU, and that despite the contingency actions we're taking, leaving without a deal would put at risk the substantial progress the British people have made over the past 10 years in repairing our economy.""The IMF warning comes as Theresa May told the BBC that MPs must choose between her proposed deal with the EU - or no deal at all.Speaking to Panorama, the prime minister said that if Parliament does not ratify her Chequers plan, ""I think that the alternative to that will be having no deal"".Mrs May said there needed to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland to avoid a hard border there.A plan by Brexiteers to resolve the Irish border issue also came in for criticism from the prime minister, who said it would create a ""hard border 20km inside Ireland"".Please upgrade your browserThe IMF's Ms Lagarde said a ""disorderly"" or ""crash"" exit from the EU would have a series of consequences, including reduced growth, an increased deficit and depreciation of sterling, causing the UK economy to contract.The IMF also said a no-deal outcome would affect other EU economies ""to a lesser extent"".""The larger the impediments to trade in the new relationship, the costlier it will be,"" Ms Lagarde said. ""This should be fairly obvious, but it seems that sometimes it is not.""She pointed out that countries tended to trade mostly with their neighbours: ""I think geography talks very loudly.""Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editorComparing this year's IMF analysis and Ms Lagarde's words with last December and there is a significant cooling of sentiment around the effects of Brexit.The IMF is signalling that, with just over six months to go before Britain is scheduled to leave the EU, the very fact that ""no deal"" remains on the table is of economic concern.When asked if she could see any ""positives"" coming from Brexit, Ms Lagarde repeated the long list of possible negatives.""No,"" seemed to be her answer.Read Kamal's blog in fullMs Lagarde said she ""very much"" hoped that the UK and the EU would strike a deal, describing herself as ""a desperate optimist"".Recent UK economic data has shown a pick-up in growth. Earlier this month, the Office for National Statistics said the economy had grown by 0.6% over the three months to July - the fastest pace in almost a year.The latest IMF prediction represents a slight upgrade for 2018. In July, the IMF said the UK economy would grow by 1.4% this year and 1.5% in 2019."

As the leading UK-wide party campaigning to stop Brexit they should be the voice of the 48% who voted Remain in 2016.But they are struggling to get out of single figures in the opinion polls. Their leader, Sir Vince Cable, has proposed some drastic remedies - transforming the party into a ""movement for moderates"" with new supporters, and opening up the next leadership contest to ""talent"" from outside the party.Sir Vince is also talking to disgruntled Labour and Conservative MPs, who he says are ready to break away from their parties in significant numbers as key Brexit votes loom in the Commons.At a Q&A session in the main hall in Brighton on Sunday, former MP Liz Lynne asked Sir Vince if all this was going to end with a new centre-ground movement led by someone like self-styled moderate Labour MP Chuka Ummuna, under a new name, and then, she added, ""the Liberal Democrats are dead"". An exasperated Sir Vince told Ms Lynne she was getting way ahead of herself. ""People are thinking of the person they hate the most and saying if they were the leader I could not possibly put up with it,"" he said.But there was no leadership contest planned in the near future, he told the audience, and if the party accepted his changes there would be robust systems to weed out unsuitable leadership candidates from outside the party.He was quite happy with the Liberal Democrat name, but if members wanted to change it that was fine too.But why not dissolve the party and form a new one, if it would help stop Brexit, which they all appear to agree is the top priority? Tom Cole, policy director of the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a second referendum and a Lib Dem member, did not rule out the idea, but could see some practical problems.""If there was a new party to be created, you would have to do it pretty quickly. Who knows how things will develop and evolve in the coming weeks and months?""I don't necessarily think you have to have one political party just focusing on that and nothing else. Questions arise about what should the party's position be on other policies. What happens if you are successful? Do you dissolve the party and go back to what it was before?""He insists People's Vote is not the forerunner of a new party as some have claimed.Ed Bird, of Waltham Forest Lib Dems said: ""The Lib Dems are not a one-issue party. It can't be just a Brexit party but there is no reason different political parties couldn't come together.""The reason anti-Brexit Labour MPs were not flocking to the Lib Dems, he argued, was because ""we are damned by the coalition with the Tories"". ""No Labour people want to get involved with us directly,"" although that is changing, he claims.""I think people are beginning to realise that we are not part of the Tory party and we are not going to jump into bed with the Tory party. We will perhaps move forward with pacts with the Labour Party, or something different, if necessary.""His friend, Bob Sullivan, is no fan of a new party but could see the Lib Dems working with other parties in Parliament to fight Brexit.""When you see (anti-Brexit Tory MP) Anna Soubry, she's brilliant. And so is Chuka. They are brilliant people within their own parties but they totally disagree with their party's stance on Brexit. ""So what would you do as a leader of the Liberal Democrats? You would be talking to them. How would you get us to come together on this issue and work together. The Liberal Democrats always like to work together with others.""Amna Ahmad, who was the Lib Dem candidate in Sutton and Cheam at last year's general election, said: ""We need to work with the current structures we have.""There were a lot of organisations, like People's Vote, trying to influence MPs over Brexit but none of them has so far stood candidates in elections, she says.""We live in a social media age, citizen power, but we still have a Parliamentary democracy and the people making the decisions are the ones there. I don't think it's about a new party that would stop Brexit. it's not as simple as that.""Caron Lindsay, of West Lothian Lib Dems, said: ""You don't actually need people to join a new party to stop Brexit. ""All you need is a majority of the MPs in the House of Commons to vote down Theresa May's deal and vote for a People's Vote. And we have been leading the arguments on that all along.""Richard Kemp, of Liverpool Walton Lib Dems, said he was happy to work with some Labour councillors but did not want to waste time ""pratting around"" with the formation of a new party.""There are 10 Labour MPs I wouldn't mind joining us. I wouldn't want more than that. We wouldn't be the Liberal Democrat party with Liberal Democrat traditions,"" he says.As for dissolving the party and starting again as a new centre-ground force, he said: ""The time for any of us to leave was during the coalition. ""I said then, and I'll say it now, you'll drag my Liberal Democrat membership card out of my cold dead hand. For Liberals who are democrats there is nowhere else for us to go."""
2018-09-17,Laura Kuenssberg,https://web.archive.org//web/20180918053718/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45555646,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMy deal or no deal! An agreement or Armageddon! Compromise or catastrophe!This is not of course a subject to be flippant about. And it is easy to see why the government has moved already to presenting the next couple of months of fraught activity in Westminster as already being a decision for MPs - back Theresa May whatever she brings back from Brussels or take a reckless roll of the dice. There is nothing funny about the forecasts of what could happen if there is no deal. Number 10 believes that will be the rub, the reality of the situation. But while they might wish they were at the closing stage where those arguments will play, they are not there yet. There are still forces at play that could shape the outcome of the deal, before the Tory whips can start counting up the votes.First - some Brexiteers are absolutely serious and organised about trying to force Theresa May to shift her plans. They are already making a lot of political noise. They will demand much of the oxygen at the Tory conference and could make life for the government extremely hard on what one described as 'any or all' votes in the run-up to the Brexit deal.It doesn't seem necessarily clear to me why the PM would be able to hold off all their demands this time, when on many previous occasions she has had to budge a little. In turn, some former Remainers plan to use other legislation coming back to Parliament to have another go at softening the government's position. There is a putative plan for another amendment to leave the country in the European economic area, starting with changing the Trade Bill in the House of Lords. One MP involved told me: ""Some MPs talk about opposing no deal but what does that really mean? There has to be a fallback plan and this amendment could lead the way to finding a solution.""It doesn't mean that those former Remainers will be successful this time around, but it doesn't mean they won't give it a good try. Add to that the increasing visibility of those campaigning for a second referendum. They know such a vote could only really come out of the turmoil of a no-deal scenario. But they are trying, extremely hard, to shift the terms of the debate.Lastly and most importantly, Theresa May's plan is a set of proposals for negotiation. While we may see friendlier rhetoric this week at an EU leaders' shindig in Salzburg, they are never going to accept her compromise in one big chunk. There will be a process of push and shove, there will have to be some more compromise. The final terms could make the calculations for MPs very different. Even some government ministers privately say they can't be sure they will back the PM until that much later stage.In the end Number 10 may well be right - they could get their way in Parliament, pushing through a historic deal not by making a persuasive case for its merits but by talking up the risks of saying no. Common sense? Or just scare tactics? That's the call MPs may have to face."

Then, many in the party felt that the existing top brass had passed their best, and the Conservatives needed fresh thinking and leadership. The slogan may have baggage, but more than a decade later, that question rather sums up why the suggestion from former minister George Freeman, on Thursday evening, that Theresa May should move on after March, can't be easily ignored. Very few Tory MPs want to say it publicly, but if they asked each other, ""Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"" many of them would confess, and admit privately in conversation that once the Brexit deal is done and we have left the EU in the spring, then Theresa May should make clear her intention not to fight the next election at a minimum.  Many believe that she should depart, or say that she is off almost immediately after that moment. Mr Freeman is not trying to push her out now and was effusive in praise for how she's managed so far. But his comments underline a widespread private assumption shared by many MPs and some ministers too - which of course may turn out to be wrong - that once the tortuous process of getting out of the EU is done, the best hope for the Tories of turning the page on the whole saga, is a new face at the helm. One senior MP, who is trying their best, for now, to keep the very rocky show on the road and who knows Theresa May well and has advised her many times told me: ""In March she's gone. Either she will have to set that out or people like me will tell her she has to go. ""If she doesn't say she's off, the letters will go in, and that will be it, so we can move on.""Some of the ministers seeking to make their mark have notions that they have a few months to do that before a potential contest. Remember, one of the big reasons that there hasn't been a leadership contest so far is that no wannabe wanted to take on the problems of Brexit. Once we have actually left, while many decisions and complexities will linger, the UK will have actually left, which should, in theory at least, create a space to change the political conversation. This is not about a handful of Brexiteers agitating to shove her out rudely because they don't like the direction of travel for the next few months. It's not about saying that there will be a sudden schism and they will crash into a leadership contest. But it's about a general sense across different wings of the Conservative Party, that Theresa May's time and political energy will have been run down by Brexit. Hold on for a minute. Politics is a rollercoaster - of course this is not inevitable. One government minister was furious this week when I asked about the very assumption that Mrs May could have less than a year in office, lambasting colleagues for discussing the subject, practically claiming that it's not a genuine topic of conversation. Another of her Cabinet allies told me tonight that ""if she delivers a good Brexit deal and the country is still moving forward, then Theresa May will still find herself in a very good position"", with the potential of leading the country and staying on for years to come. Certainly, time after time Theresa May has surprised and defied those who've tried to tear her down. What is the case though, is that many Tories have already made their minds up, that her time will be up within the next year. And in articulating his view publicly, Mr Freeman is saying what huge numbers of his colleagues have been thinking too. "
2018-09-17,'Not a forecast',https://web.archive.org//web/20180918053718/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45519309,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Governor of the Bank of England has always been clear about two things.That the present Brexit process has had negative effects on the broader economy and on people's incomes.And that a Brexit deal where there is no formal agreement between Britain and the European Union would make those effects worse.As Mark Carney said to me in an interview earlier this week to mark the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis, Brexit is one of the Big Four risks the Bank is facing.A debt crisis in China, problematically high household debt in the UK and a catastrophic cyber-attack taking out a whole bank are the others.""There are risks around Brexit for the financial sector,"" he told me.""And here's something that's changed with the system from 10 years ago - we are absolutely upfront about those risks, our view of those risks.""We have stress tested our banks against those risks to make sure they have enough of a safety net, both in terms of their own funds plus liquid funds, in case we had a no deal Brexit.""The key phrase is ""stress tested"".The Bank's Financial Policy Committee regularly sets ""doomsday scenarios"" to test the banking system's robustness in the face of a significant shock.The last stress test in November involved a scenario where house prices fell by 33%, interest rates rose to 4% and unemployment doubled.It became known as the ""no deal test"" and is remarkably close to the headlines we are seeing this morning.It appears that the Governor wasn't providing the Cabinet with a forecast of what the Bank believes would happen in the event of a no deal Brexit.He was briefing the Cabinet on what preparations the Bank was making if that does happen, including last November's stress test.It was not a forecast. It was an apocalyptic test where the Bank deliberately sets the parameters beyond what might reasonably be expected to occur.The major banks all passed the test, giving reassurance that the financial system can cope with whatever happens next year.The Governor believes that a ""no deal"" scenario would be bad for the economy.But not as bad as the headlines today which are based on a doomsday scenario that is not actually forecast to happen.There is another point that is often lost in the loudness of the negative headlines.If there is a ""good deal"" with the EU, Mr Carney believes there could be a significant boost to the economy as pent-up demand held back by the present uncertainty is released.Investment could rise markedly, he has argued.Those are the options as he sees them, and it is up to the politicians on both sides of the negotiation to come to a decision on which route they take."
2018-09-17,No-deal preparations,https://web.archive.org//web/20180918053718/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45514495,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA lot of hassle and potential cost for a lot of people. The government's spent the afternoon giving details of what might need to happen, if there was no deal with the EU.There's no guarantee you'd be able to avoid big phone bills if you use your mobile abroad, although ministers say they'd cap any data charges at Â£45 a month and some of the firms say they won't change prices. If you want to go on the road on the continent, you might need an International Driving Permit. If you want to jump on a cheap flight for a last-minute weekend, better check you have six months left on your passport, or you might be turned back.If there isn't a deal, many products tested in the UK after Brexit will have to go through the same process again - but with an EU authority in charge. The list of what might have to happen is a very long one. And some of the trickiest implications, like what would happen to planes flying between European and British skies, haven't even been published yet. And as the French foreign minister suggested, the Eurostar might not be able to run, and yes, planes may not be able to fly if a resolution can't be found. Publishing the papers are part of the government's plan to look like they are prepared for the potential shock and disruption of the negotiations failing. And indeed, for some in government, publicly detailing those preparations is part of a tactic to suggest that they have a way out and are ready to walk away, if Brussels doesn't budge. What ministers won't say, however, is how much money we might have to pay the EU if there were to be no deal. The Brexit secretary and the prime minister have both repeatedly said that the estimated price tag of nearly Â£40bn if there is a deal would not be paid in full. But they refuse point blank to give an assessment of how much it would be, if we walked away without an agreement. The reality is the cost would probably still be many billions, and it would take lawyers many, many years to be able to agree on it. In that situation, the government would be walking away without being able to tell MPs or the public how much we would still have to stump up. Ministers' belief, however, is that the chances of there being no agreement are now relatively small. They are hopeful that next week EU leaders will give helpful hints at a special meeting in Salzburg. On Thursday, the Brexit secretary told me he believes the EU will meet the UK ""half way"" on the Irish border issue, which for many many months has been the trickiest issue of all.Yet there is a long way to go until he, or anyone in government, can be sure. And don't doubt that many Tory MPs are adamant they simply won't vote for the kind of proposal Theresa May has put on the table. One senior MP told me: ""If people in Number 10 haven't made clear to her that 'Chequers minus minus' isn't going to get through the Commons, then she is getting the wrong advice."" After all, there are two kinds of ""no deal"" - one seems very unlikely, where the EU and the UK simply can't agree. The prime minister comes back to Parliament and says: ""I'm sorry, I tried, but it just won't wash.""But the other is that Theresa May comes back with a deal but her party, and Parliament, chucks it out. The political climate would be different in those two cases. But in the potential chaos of either, the hassle outlined on Thursday might just be the start. "
2018-09-17,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180918053718/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.3%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-17,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180918053718/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

It comes after EU negotiator Michel Barnier suggested a shift in tone on his controversial ""backstop"" plan.Mrs May said her own Chequers plan would ensure ""frictionless trade"".The UK and EU both want to avoid a hard border - meaning any physical infrastructure like cameras or guard posts - but can't agree on how.Mrs May has previously rejected the EU's ""backstop"" plan - which involves keeping Northern Ireland aligned with its trading rules - saying it would divide up the UK.Ahead of the Salzburg summit, Mr Barnier said most checks could take place away from border areas, an apparent concession to the UK. But another key EU figure, European Council President Donald Tusk, said the UK's own plans ""will need to be reworked"".Addressing reporters as she arrived for dinner in the Austrian city, Mrs May said her blueprint for future relations was ""the only credible and negotiable plan on the table that delivers no hard border in Northern Ireland"".She added: ""If we're going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position too.""After Brexit, the 310 mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become the UK's border with the EU. At the moment, thousands of people cross it every day for both work and pleasure - as do goods, like food and medicines, being delivered across the two countries.As part of the EU single market and customs union, these products do not need to be checked for customs and standards, but when the UK leaves these two arrangements, this all changes.Nobody wants a hard border for the checks - in fact the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which helped bring peace to Northern Ireland, got rid of security checks as part of the deal, and police in Northern Ireland have warned reinstating them could make crossings targets for violence. But there is no agreement between the UK and EU, or between Leavers and Remainers, about the answer. Privately, EU officials say those checks could be carried out by British or EU officials, or by health inspectors rather than customs officials, to ""de-dramatise"" the border issue.Mrs May has insisted there needs to be ""friction-free movement of goods"", with no customs or regulatory checks, between Northern Ireland and the Republic, in order to avoid a hard border there.There are just over six months to go before the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.Negotiations are at a critical stage, with both sides hoping for an agreement on the terms of the UK's withdrawal and future trade relations by the start of November at the latest.Please upgrade your browserSpeaking on Tuesday, Mr Barnier said the talks were in the ""home straight"" but there were still significant areas of disagreement - such as on the role of the European Court of Justice in enforcing the withdrawal agreement and intellectual property issues, including geographical protections for food and drink.""October is the key point in time - it is the moment of truth,"" he added. The EU is still insisting on its own ""legally operationally backstop"" - what it describes as an insurance policy to prevent the return of physical infrastructure on the border in the event no other solution can be found.Brussels put forward a proposal in February that would see Northern Ireland stay aligned with the EU in key areas, effectively staying in the customs union and single market and not needing those border checks.But the UK insisted this was unacceptable as it would split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK.On Tuesday Mr Barnier said the backstop should focus on a ""set of technical checks and controls"" to make sure standards are met and customs are paid, and not be about a sea or land border. ""We are ready to improve this proposal,"" he said.""Work on the EU side is ongoing. We are clarifying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed.""We can also clarify that most checks can take place away from the border at a company premises or at the markets.""BBC Northern Ireland business editor John Campbell said that the fact the EU was prepared to ""improve"" the language of the backstop was not news as it had been talked about before - so ""we need to wait and see what any improvements might amount to"".Speaking in Salzburg, Mr Tusk confirmed a special EU summit dedicated to Brexit would take place in mid-November.He welcomed some elements of the Chequers proposals - on security and policing - but said that on the Irish border and economic cooperation they will need to be ""reworked and further negotiated"".At the dinner in Salzburg, Mrs May is expected to appeal for ""goodwill and determination"" from the EU, while stressing that ""no other country"" could accept the EU's backstop plan if they were in the same situation.The UK put forward rival backstop proposals in June, which would see the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU after the end of the proposed Brexit transition period in December 2020.It also says its Chequers blueprint for a future trading relationship - involving a ""common rulebook"" for goods and treating the UK and the EU as a ""combined customs territory"" - would provide the solution to the border question.Former Brexit secretary David Davis said the EU was shifting its position by accepting checks could take place away from the border.Mr Davis, who resigned in protest at the Chequers plan, told the Today programme he did not ""expect much"" from the Salzburg summit, predicting it would be November - and with the threat of no deal looming - before the EU shifted its position.He said the EU's ""standard approach"" to negotiations was to ""pocket everything"" and give ground at the last minute, ""after they've tested your mettle"".The DUP's Nigel Dodds said: ""So Michel Barnier says he can do different kinds of checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK as if that makes it more palatable.""The fundamental point is that internal UK checks are only needed if it is intended to separate Northern Ireland from Great Britain.""Labour MP Owen Smith, from the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said: ""The DUP look to have sunk Barnier's improved offer on Northern Ireland before he has even floated it.""In an interview with the Daily Express, Mrs May said that going back on the 2016 vote to leave the EU would ""destroy trust in politicians"".MPs had decided to give people a vote on EU membership by a large margin, she said: ""People weren't saying it's the choice of the public except if we disagree with the answer we'll ask them again.""The People's Vote campaign wants the final terms of Brexit to be put to a referendum with the option of staying in the EU if it is rejected.""My answer to the People's Vote is that we've had the people's vote - it was the referendum - and now we should deliver on it,"" the prime minister said.On Tuesday People's Vote set out ways they said a new referendum could be achieved through votes in Parliament."
2018-09-18,PM: Make people proud of council houses,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45569453,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPeople who live in council houses should be made to feel proud of their homes, Theresa May has said.The PM announced Â£2bn to build new homes in England, in an attempt to remove the ""stigma"" of social housing.Under the plan, housing associations, councils and other organisations will be able to bid for the money to spend on new projects, starting from 2022.Labour said the announcement fell ""far short"" of what was needed for the social housing sector.BBC home editor Mark Easton said the government hopes the money will allow local authorities and housing associations to build schemes that would otherwise seem too risky.He said the sector's calls to provide more confidence about future funding - so the 300,000 extra homes required in England each year can be built - had appeared to have been listened to.Mrs May told a National Housing Federation summit in London: ""Some residents feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority.""On the outside, many people in society - including too many politicians - continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home.""She will encourage housing associations to change how tenants and society view social housing.""We should never see social housing as something that need simply be 'good enough', nor think that the people who live in it should be grateful for their safety net and expect no better,"" she said.""I want to see social housing that is so good people are proud to call it their home... our friends and neighbours who live in social housing are not second-rate citizens.""In mixed developments, she said it should be impossible to tell the difference between full-price and affordable housing, which should not be ""tucked away out of sight and out of mind"".David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said the prime minister's announcement was ""extremely welcome"".""This represents a total step change. For years, the way that money was allocated meant housing associations couldn't be sure of long-term funding to build much-needed affordable housing,"" he said.He said that by changing the way the funding was allocated, ministers had given ""long-term confidence and confirmed that we are trusted partners in solving the housing crisis, building new homes and communities"".Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said it was welcome that the government was ""starting to get serious"" about correcting the ""historic failure"" to build social homes.""This must be the start and not the end,"" she said.Shadow housing secretary John Healey said the reality was spending on new affordable homes had been ""slashed"" and the number of new social rented homes built last year ""fell to the lowest level since records began"".""If Conservative ministers are serious about fixing the housing crisis they should back Labour's plans to build a million genuinely affordable homes, including the biggest council house-building programme for more than 30 years,"" he said.The English housing survey for 2016/17 reported that 3.9 million households - about nine million people - lived in the social rented sector, which was 17% of households in the country.The funding covers the next spending review period, from 2021 through to 2028.Downing Street said the money was separate to the Â£9bn of public funding put toward the existing affordable homes programme until 2022."
2018-09-18,UK inflation hits six-month high of 2.7%,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45572856,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK inflation rate unexpectedly rose in August to 2.7%, the highest level in six months.Economists had expected a Consumer Prices Index rate of 2.4%. The pound rose after the data was released by the Office for National Statistics.Wages are still rising more than inflation, with data last week showing wages, excluding bonuses, grew by 2.9% in the three months to July.Rising prices for recreational goods, transport and clothing drove the rise.In July, CPI was 2.5%, , which had been the first jump in the index since November.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: ""Consumers paid more for theatre shows, sea fares and new season autumn clothing last month. ""However, mobile phone charges, and furniture and household goods had a downward effect on inflation.""Prices rose less sharply for furniture, household goods and communications.The year-on-year rise in CPI in August meant that inflation was narrowing the gap with wage increases, with economists waiting for the August earnings figures.Alastair Neame, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: ""Today's inflation data show the rate of price growth accelerated in August, and may well prove to have exceeded total earnings growth in the same period. Unless UK workers can increase their productivity, this trend is likely to continue - squeezing living standards over the medium term."" The pound rose to $1.32 following the news, its highest level since July, before  falling back under $1.3140 following comments by Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, over the Irish border question.""The numbers reinforce expectations that policymakers will gently lift interest rates over the next couple of years,"" said Ben Brettell at Hargreaves Lansdown.The Bank of England raised its key interest rate for only the second time in a decade last month. The current interest rate of 0.75% is the highest since March 2009.It has also forecast that inflation will fall back to the target rate of 2% by 2020.""The figures won't come as welcome news to the Bank of England, though - they'll be desperate to leave policy unchanged until we get some clarity over Brexit and won't want to be forced into a rate rise by accelerating prices,"" said Mr Brettell.The CPI measure reached 3.1% in November 2017, when price rises were fuelled by the weakness in the pound following Brexit vote.In August, the largest change in prices was in the cultural services sector, where theatre tickets rose, and also games, toys and hobbies, while prices for computer goods rose after falling a year ago.The ONS said transport costs as a component of inflation increased, largely because of rises in sea and air fares. Petrol prices, though, rose by 1.4 pence between July and August, less than the 1.8 pence rise of a year earlier.The average price of clothing and footwear rose 3.1% between July and August, faster than the 2.4% a year before. While clothing prices usually rise between July and August, the ONS said women's and children's clothing drove the rise.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the fact that the inflation rise was fuelled by reaction and cultural goods meant it would be temporary: ""We would expect this to unwind in next month's release.""The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, was 3.5% in August, up from 3.2% in July."
2018-09-18,'Wild West' Bitcoin 'should be regulated',https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45558593,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBitcoin and other digital currencies are a ""Wild West industry"" and need to be regulated to protect investors, a committee of MPs has urged.Problems include volatile prices, minimal consumer protection and risks of hacking and money-laundering, says the Treasury Committee.The committee said there were no well-functioning crypto-currencies and preferred to call them ""crypto-assets"".It urged City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority to supervise them.At present, the FCA has no power to regulate either the issuers of these assets or the exchanges on which they are traded.""Crypto-asset investors are currently afforded very little protection from the litany of risks. Namely, there are no formal mechanisms for consumer redress, nor compensation,"" said the committee. There are now more than 1,500 varieties of crypto-asset being traded on about 190 exchanges around the world. Prices have soared and crashed alarmingly. In 2017, the price of a Bitcoin rocketed to nearly Â£15,000 before losing two-thirds of its value in just a few months. Crypto-fundraising schemes, known as Initial Coin Offerings, have posed challenges for regulators around the world.""As the government and regulators decide whether the current Wild West situation is allowed to continue, or whether they are going to introduce regulation, consumers remain unprotected,"" said the Treasury Committee. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the committee, said: ""It's unsustainable for the government and regulators to bumble along issuing feeble warnings to potential investors, yet refrain from acting. ""At a minimum, regulation should address consumer protection and anti-money-laundering.""CryptoUK, which was set up in February as a self-regulatory body for the crypto-currency industry, said it welcomed the Treasury Committee's recommendations.Iqbal Gandham, who chairs it, said: ""Self-regulation by the industry was always intended to be a starting point - this must now be matched by government action.

It's a Tory project, pursued for Tory ends, of which working people will be the main victims.""He described Tory Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg, as ""fundamentalists"" for which ""the costs of Brexit have always been irrelevant"".He was due to say that ""years of economic pain justified by the erotic spasm of leaving the European Union. Economic pain felt - of course - not by them by those least able to afford it.""However Sir Vince mangled the ""erotic spasm"" line that had grabbed most of the overnight headlines:The Lib Dem leader took aim at what he described as Tory ""chancers"" like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, who he said had only backed Brexit to further their own leadership ambitions. He said Mr Johnson was a ""real danger to Britain"", comparing him with US President Donald Trump.""He doesn't just resemble Trump - large, loud and blonde - he behaves more like him by the day.""Their cynical disregard for the truth, their treatment of women, and their inflammatory divisive language make Boris and Donald the 'terrible twins of the rabid right'.""Mr Gove, on the other hand, was the ""ideal man for a penalty shoot out - right to the last moment you never know which way he will go"".The Lib Dem leader, who has said he will step down when Brexit has been ""resolved or stopped"", has put the chances of another referendum at about ""30%"".But he is talking to anti-Brexit Labour and Conservative MPs about how to get a second referendum, possibly by tabling a new bill or an amendment to legislation already going through Parliament, with proposed referendum questions.He claimed Theresa May, who voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum but has vowed to deliver on the will of the people, knows ""deep down"" that Brexit is a ""bad idea"" whose ""time has gone"".He urged her to show ""true leadership"" by admitting that staying in the EU will be better than any deal she can get in Brussels.""Instead of kowtowing to her enemies in the Conservative Party, she could lead her party and the country by opening her mind to a 'People's Vote' on the final deal"", he said. The Lib Dem leader also used his speech to set out a vision of a ""liberal future"" for Britain after the ""Brexit nightmare"" has been stopped, vowing to ""restore a sense of fairness and opportunity to a country where both have been lost"".He set out plans, announced at the weekend, to set up a Â£100bn citizens' fund to spread the UK's wealth more evenly, paid for, in part, by abolishing inheritance tax and replacing it with a ""levy on large financial gifts received over a lifetime"".The Lib Dems would also increase taxes on the wealthy, tackle homelessness, solve the housing crisis and combat racism, while controlling immigration, he said, referring to his ""personal experience of racism"" in the late 1960s.""My wife and children were being denounced as people whose very presence here would lead to rivers foaming with blood. And I was thrown out of the parental home,"" he told his party conference.Sir Vince also used his speech to set out plans to transform his party, which has 12 MPs and has languished in the opinion polls since being in coalition with the Tories, into a ""movement for moderates"" and open up its next leadership contest to non-MPs.He said the party was still ""very pale and very male"", adding: ""We must change that and keep growing."""
2018-09-18,'Multiple chances' for new Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45566204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs will have ""multiple"" opportunities to give the public the final say over whether the UK leaves the EU, the People's Vote campaign group has said.Theresa May has ruled out a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations under any circumstances.But People's Vote said there were six plausible scenarios in which Parliament could legislate for another vote.It said there should be a choice for voters between leaving with or without a deal or staying on current terms.The prime minister says the UK made its choice to leave in 2016 and that her plan for future co-operation with the EU - based on the Chequers blueprint agreed in July - respects the referendum result.She has said the choice facing Parliament is between leaving with or without a comprehensive agreement. But in a report called Roadmap to a People's Vote the group campaigning for a referendum on any Brexit deal said there were no practical or legal barriers to giving the public the final say through a referendum and urged MPs not to hide behind ""logistical arguments"".  The British public voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.89% to 48.11% in a referendum in June 2016. The UK is scheduled to leave on 29 March 2019, under the terms of the two-year Article 50 process. Negotiations on the terms of the UK's withdrawal, the so-called divorce settlement, as well as the shape of future relations between the two sides are now at a critical stage.European leaders meeting in Salzburg on Wednesday are expected to agree to hold a special summit in November at which any deal sealed in the next six weeks could be approved.Parliament will then be expected to vote on the terms of any agreement before the end of the year.People's Vote said this Commons showdown, when it happened, could be a catalyst for securing a referendum. The six ways it believes a referendum could be delivered are:Lord Kerr, the former top civil servant who wrote the report, said MPs who wanted a referendum faced a ""high bar"" given the government's control of the Parliamentary timetable.But he pointed out that Mrs May, who relies on the Democratic Unionist Party for her slim Commons majority, had already suffered two Brexit defeats and if Parliament did not act ""it will not be due to procedural impediments or a lack of time but because MPs have not chosen to take these opportunities"".The cross-bench peer said the government could easily seek an extension of the Article 50 process to allow for a referendum by ""withdrawing"" the letter sent on 29 March 2017 notifying the EU of its intention to leave. ""The die is not irrevocably cast,"" he wrote. ""There is still time. If there is a majority in Parliament for a People's Vote, there are multiple routes to securing one and, as the process unfolds, more opportunities for the House of Commons to assert its will may emerge.""In terms of what question would be asked, People's Vote said it did not rule out having three options on the ballot paper - namely any deal agreed by the two sides, leaving without a deal or staying in on current terms.But it said this was unlikely to get the backing of MPs and a ""binary choice"" between two options would be clearer, simpler and quicker.While there was a case for giving 16-year olds the vote and allowing EU nationals living in the UK to take part, it said there might be ""practical limits"" on any changes to the franchise given the timescale involved.The Lib Dems, the SNP and a growing number of Labour MPs back the idea of a referendum but Jeremy Corbyn has not committed to one as yet and only a handful of Tories support it."
2018-09-18,Call to scrap high-skilled migrants cap,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45556246,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe cap on the number of high-skilled migrants coming to the UK should be scrapped, according to a key report commissioned by the government ahead of Brexit.The Migration Advisory Committee says these workers make a more positive contribution to the public finances. It suggests EU workers should be subject to the same visa rules as other migrants.But it notes the UK might offer them special status under a Brexit deal.The government has said it will ""carefully consider"" the committee's proposals. Labour backed the report, calling for an ""end to discrimination"" against non-EU migrants.  Under the current system, workers from the European Economic Area (EEA) - which includes all EU countries including the UK, as well as Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein - enjoy freedom of movement, travelling and working within the area without visas. The committee recommends a policy allowing greater access for higher-skilled migration while restricting access for lower-skilled workers. It suggests extending the current scheme for high-skilled non-EEA migrants - known as a Tier 2 visa - to those from EEA countries as well.As part of this process, the cap on the total amount of workers allowed to enter under Tier 2 should be abolished and the range of jobs eligeable for the visas expanded, the committee says. Current policy is to allow 20,700 high-skilled workers into the UK each year on Tier 2 visas. The current salary threshold for such visas is Â£30,000, which the report says should be retained. Top priority is given to jobs on a ""shortage occupation list"".Examples include:With regard to low-skilled workers, the committee says it is ""not convinced there needs to be a work route for low-skilled workers"" from the EU to fill jobs in industries such as catering or hospitality.The ""possible exception"" to this rule could be for seasonal agriculture, where 99% of the workers come from EU countries. It also does not recommend that there should be exceptions for workers coming to the UK to work in the public sector. The committee - which is made up of independent experts, says it does not seen any ""compelling reasons to offer a different set of rules"" for workers from the EEA than those from other countries - unless such a position has been arrived at as part of the Brexit negotiations. ""A migrant's impact depends on factors such as their skills, employment, age and use of public services, and not fundamentally on their nationality,"" it says. The report goes on to say there is no evidence that increased European migration has damaged life in the UK. It concludes that EU migrants pay more in tax than they receive in benefits, contribute more to the NHS workforce than the healthcare they access, and have no effect on crime rates. It says the impact of all EEA migration to the UK since 2004 was almost certainly less than that of the fall in the value of the pound following the referendum vote.By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondentMinisters commissioned this report because they needed clear facts on the role of European workers in the country - and the implications of ending their freedom of movement. But it's too soon to know how many of the committee's recommendations will be adopted because of the Brexit elephant in the room.So while the experts want no special immigration deal for future EU workers (the report does not concern those who are already living in the UK), it doesn't consider whether a special deal would be good or bad for Britain.Such a deal is a possibility. The prime minister's Chequers plan proposes a ""mobility framework"" - a system allowing British and EU citizens to study and work in each other countries, potentially linked to a trade deal.So if the ministers offer special access for future EU workers, in return for something they want for the UK, this report won't help us know whether it is worth it. The MAC was asked to do the research in July 2017 by then Home Secretary Amber Rudd.It is thought it could shape the government's post-Brexit immigration policy. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May might start ""sketching out"" her plans for this at October's Conservative Party conference.He added that the report would increase pressure on her to not compromise on freedom of movement during the Brexit negotiations. Please upgrade your browserStephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said if the recommendations were adopted, it would signal ""the biggest change to the UK labour market in a generation"" and would represent a ""huge shift"" for sectors such as hotels and food manufacturing.He said: ""If enacted, these proposals would effectively end low-skilled migration, while prioritising mid- and high-skill migration in areas where we have labour shortages. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the recommendations, saying the UK had long depended on recruiting nursing professionals from around the world.But Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the report was ""blind to the impact"" of EU migration to a number of communities. He said the proposals would ""permit continued high levels of immigration"" and ""the overall outcome would be to weaken immigration control"".The government says it will listen to the report and bring in an immigration system that works for the whole of the UK, adding: ""EU citizens play an important and positive role in our economy and society and we want that to continue after we leave"".Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the UK's immigration policy should be ""based on our economic needs, while meeting our legal obligations and treating people fairly"".""[This] means ending the discrimination against non-EU migrants, especially from the Commonwealth,"" she added. But Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the report was ""puzzling"" with ""significant gaps"" between the MAC's research and recommendations. ""The MAC admit they have ignored the crucial relationship between immigration and trade,"" she said. Without analysis on relationship between trade & immigration, and on how to address impact on key sectors like social care, Parliament & Govt still doesnât have the info it needs to inform the negotiations & future plansEnd of Twitter post  by @YvetteCooperMPThe report comes as figures for 2017, showed that net migration from the EU was at its lowest level since 2012 - with overall net migration at 282,000.The government wants to cut overall net migration to the tens of thousands."

But sceptics have expressed concern about opening up the UK market to imports of US products such as chlorine-washed chicken, and the NHS to American health firms.People behind the ""ideal US-UK free trade agreement"" - which was edited by Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan - say it would eliminate trade barriers and ""stimulate innovation"" - but environmental campaigners described it as a ""low-standards free-for-all"".Launching it in London, primary author Dan Ikenson from the Cato Institute said the document was ""somewhat idealistic"" and ""pie in the sky"".""It doesn't pay a whole lot of attention to political realities,"" he said, adding that his approach would be to ""put everything on the table except the issues that are going to be most politically difficult to overcome"".Mr Ikenson acknowledged concerns about the NHS, saying the UK government would have the option of ""carving out"" the health service as an exemption.Aside from a limited number of exemptions, under the proposals all public procurement would be open to competition from the other country.It also calls for EU-style free movement to apply between the UK and the US. Asked about immigration concerns that drove some people to vote for Brexit in 2016, Mr Ikenson said there were similar views in the US, saying his proposed model would be conditional on a job offer and workers would be given a deadline to return if they were made redundant.""This is not immigration run roughshod,"" he said.The report also suggests that in areas such as consumer safety, workers' rights and the environment, businesses could only have to comply with one country's regulations in order to eliminate barriers to free trade.It says this would allow firms to achieve economies of scale and cut prices.But Amy Mount of the Greener UK coalition said: ""Flooding our supermarkets with chlorinated chicken, undercutting our farmers and lowering environmental standards would be a strange way to take back control. ""The UK has benefited from trade deals that embrace high standards, and enjoyed high quality food and safer products as a result. Our blueprint for post-Brexit trade should be defined by a lighter footprint on the global environment, not a low-standards free-for-all.""The IFT was launched last year by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, but the report's authors said they had not been involved in drawing up the suggested trade deal, which was described as a non-partisan project.Asked who paid for the report, Mr Ikenson said the Cato Institute had a ""diversity of funding"", with 80% from private donors."
2018-09-18,BMW to shut Mini plant for month post-Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45561908,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Mini factory in Oxford will shut down for a month after Brexit at the end of March to minimise disruption in case of a no-deal outcome.Owner BMW said its summer maintenance shutdown had been brought forward to 1 April to reduce any ""possible short-term parts-supply disruption"". ""While we believe this worst case scenario is an unlikely outcome, we have to plan for it,"" BMW said.The German firm said it ""remained committed"" to its UK operations.The Cowley plant, on the outskirts of Oxford, will remain open in April with maintenance, management and catering staff continuing to work despite no cars being made. It employs 4,500 people and produces 5,000 cars a week.BMW said the downtime would be used to start preparing the plant to make the new electric Mini. The concern is that in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the borders and shortages of parts.Hundreds of lorries a day arrive at Cowley with parts from across the world, with 60% of components coming from the EU.Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondentFactory shutdowns are common in the car industry. Machinery needs to be repaired or replaced and updates or modifications to production lines carried out. Usually at Mini this happens during the summer and is built into the carmaker's output planning.What BMW has done is simply reschedule that shutdown to coincide with a potential period of serious disruption at the borders after Brexit, if we leave the EU without a deal. If the plant is not actually making cars, then a shortage of imported parts should not be so much of a problem. The company says a no-deal outcome is unlikely, but has to be planned for. Rescheduling the annual shutdown looks like a relatively simple and inexpensive piece of contingency planning. Nevertheless, it does send out a political message. It's a reminder that carmakers are particularly reliant on frictionless borders, to ensure parts arrive where they're needed at exactly the right time. And it shows that BMW is taking the risk of a no-deal Brexit seriously.Add that to comments made by the Jaguar Land Rover boss last week suggesting that the wrong Brexit deal could cost tens of thousands of jobs, and it suggests that people within the industry are getting rather nervous right now. Other carmakers with British operations have warned that a bad or no Brexit deal would be damaging for the UK car industry.Earlier on Tuesday, the head of Honda Europe, Ian Howells, told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would cost his company tens of millions of pounds.""In terms of administration, we'd probably be looking at something like sixty odd thousand additional bits of documentation we would have to provide to get product to and from Europe,"" Mr Howells told BBC Radio 5 live.""And clearly if we end up with World Trade Organization tariffs we'd have something like 10% costs in addition on our shipped product back into Europe, and that would certainly run into tens of millions of pounds.""Last week, Jaguar Land Rover boss Ralf Speth warned the government to get ""the right Brexit"" or it could wipe out profits at the carmaker and lead to big job cuts.On Tuesday the company said about 1,000 workers at its Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham would move from a five-day to a three-day week from October until Christmas.JLR - the UK's largest carmaker - said it was making ""temporary adjustments"" to its production schedules at the factory, which produces Jaguar cars."

Ian Howells told the BBC that quitting the bloc without an agreement would affect the carmaker's competitiveness in Europe. He said the Japanese firm was preparing for a no-deal outcome but had not discussed relocating its Swindon plant. The firm builds its Civic model in Britain for the global market. In an interview with Radio 5 live, Mr Howells said a no-deal Brexit would lead to costly trade barriers and disrupt its supply chain.""In terms of administration, we'd probably be looking at something like sixty odd thousand additional bits of documentation we would have to provide to get product to and from Europe,"" he told the Wake up to Money programme.""And clearly if we end up with World Trade Organization tariffs we'd have something like 10% costs in addition on our shipped product back into Europe, and that would certainly run into tens of millions of pounds.""""Likewise when we're looking at componentry coming the other way, again [it could cost] tens of millions in terms of tariffs coming into the UK.""Like other carmakers in Britian, Honda only stores about an hour's worth of components at its Swindon plant to keep costs down.Instead it relies on about 350 truckloads of parts that are delivered from the continent each day. Mr Howells said the loss of ""frictionless trade"" in this supply chain would harm its production output and competitiveness.  ""If we are shipping and competing against a European manufacturer in Europe, they are not incurring those tariffs,"" he said. ""And in the UK it would be the componentry cost that would be the main additional burden we would have to carry for UK customers.""A host of carmakers in Britain, including Nissan and Jaguar, have warned a bad or no Brexit deal would be damaging for the UK car industry.EU customers buy about â¬15bn ($18.5bn; Â£13bn) worth of British-made cars per year, accounting for 53% of the UK's vehicle exports.However, despite uncertainty over a future trade deal, carmakers such as Nissan, BMW and Toyota have committed to expanding production in Britain since the Brexit vote.Mr Howells told the BBC that Honda was preparing for a potential no-deal outcome by carrying ""a little bit more componentry than we otherwise would"" and by reviewing its production schedules. However, he added the Swindon plant manufactured for the global market, not just Europe, and that there had been no discussions about moving it. He also said the firm supported the Prime Minister's Chequer's deal, which proposes following a ""common rule book"" with the EU for trade in goods.Critics say the deal would make Britain a rule taker, not a rule maker, and hamper its ability to strike trade deals around the world. But Mr Howells said common rules for building and approving vehicles across Europe would be a ""positive"" for the car industry. "

The democracy review was sold as a way of empowering the membership and some on the left are fearful that it will instead further empower trade union leaders.Some local trade union branches have very few members while many of the branches consisting of fully-paid up individual party members are much larger.So a relatively small number of trade unionists could trigger a re-selection contest since it would be much easier to get 30% of trade union branches to give the sitting MP the thumbs down than 30% of the (often much larger) membership branches.There had been talk of a further compromise - giving less weight to smaller union branches.On the latest information I have, it looks like this further proposal may have been dropped.One NEC member suggested privately that the ""compromise"" - rather than either protecting sitting MPs or giving members a much greater say -  would in effect allow Unite chief Len McCluskey ""to pick off whoever he wants"".So even the ""compromise"" hasn't been agreed.Not knowingly undersold, one insider said ""it could be war"".There has also been a change to the initial proposal for selecting Jeremy Corbyn's eventual successor. What was floated at the last meeting of the NEC was a new system which would allow a candidate to get nominated with the backing of just 5% of MPs (the current threshold is 10%) so long as either 10% of local constituency parties, or 10% of unions, also nominated them.Today the NEC will discuss a new proposal - a future leader would require not only the support of 10% of MPs and local parties but would now also require the support of two trade unions that account for 5% of 'affiliated' members.Complicated as that is (and believe it or not, I have simplified the options) the upshot is that a leadership candidate wouldn't get on the ballot without the backing of some big unions.And some Momentum activists are complaining that this would skew power away from rank and file party members and are pledging to oppose it.Momentum has been pressing its members to deluge the NEC with emails calling for the leadership threshold to be reduced to 5% of MPs and for any compromise on parliamentary selections to be ditched.""Their phones are imploding under the weight of emails,"" one source said.The NEC is likely to be expanded to include, specifically, party members with disabilities and those from an ethnic minority  background. But the proposal today is that these new places will be elected equally by unions and rank-and-file members, not just by the party membership alone.After the last NEC meeting, a Corbyn-sceptic told me he had ""kicked into the long grass"" a proposal that the leaders of local authority Labour groups would be elected by the wider membership and not just by councils.Well, someone has got the political lawnmower out, because it's back on the agenda now.And local government manifestos might be drawn up not by councillors but wider local government committees which include trade union nominees.Under the current system when an NEC place chosen by the members (the unions, councillors, shadow cabinet and MPs/MEPs have their own dedicated places) becomes vacant, the runner up in the annual elections is automatically promoted onto the NEC.I understand an NEC member is considering standing down and that would mean comedian Eddie Izzard (who wasn't supported by the left) would be elevated. But under proposals to be discussed today a by-election, seen as unnecessarily expensive by opponents, would be held in future - increasing the chance of a left-wing replacementA proposal to have existing NEC members choose amongst themselves who joins them has been dropped.Clearly there are plenty of issues still to be agreed, but whatever backroom deals are done, or compromises concluded, it's likely by the end of Labour conference that it will be easier to replace sitting MPs and that it's even more likely that someone on the left (not necessarily the so-called 'hard left') will replace Jeremy Corbyn when the time comes.And that the tension between a vision of a ""members-led"" party which Momentum has been advocating, and one where the big trade unions retain power, will continue."

Here is what we learned from their annual conference...In case you were in any doubt about the Liberal Democrats' position on Brexit they have spent the last four days telling anyone who'll listen that it must be stopped. ""We are absolutely solid that we need to vote against Brexit and stop it,"" leader Sir Vince Cable said. How exactly they might do that is less clear, because, as it stands, if MPs vote against a deal reached by the government with the EU, the UK would leave with no agreement in place.  A ""People's Vote"" is needed, which Sir Vince told us could be arranged ""within weeks.""Despite announcing he would step down at some point before the next general election, Sir Vince told us he would be ""pretty busy for quite a long time"".  But he also said it was ""uncertain"" whether he would still be in the job by the end of next year. Nobody in Brighton seems to know exactly how much longer Sir Vince will be leader of the party, himself included. The conference has felt a bit like the start of a long goodbye to someone who has accepted he has a limited shelf-life. The Liberal Democrats don't do anything in a hurry. Even a Q&A session with their leader in the main conference hall was strictly moderated. Members were called upon to approach the ""intervention microphone"" and offered ""supplementary questions"". Some activists made it clear they weren't convinced about their leader's plan to give non-paying supporters a say in new policy and allow non-MPs to lead the party. ""We'll be dead,"" warned one, another said they could ""end up with someone like Chuka Umunna.""The campaigner and businesswoman was given star billing on Monday, with a speech in the main hall which members seemed to love. Surely if the party is hoping to attract new people, and allow non-MPs to lead them in future, Gina Miller would be a suitable candidate? Apparently not. She ruled herself out within the first minute of her speech to enthusiastic applause. Go figure. No, it's not a joke. Or a typo. And yes, he really was due to say that in his speech. Sir Vince Cable's proposed ""colourful metaphor"" to describe Britain's exit from the European Union dominated the pre-speech headlines.  He said he wouldn't ""deconstruct it in detail"" when asked exactly what he meant on the Today programme. The point was that the people Sir Vince describes as ""the true believers"" and ""fundamentalists"" were willing to take economic pain in return for the joy of leaving the EU.Unfortunately it didn't quite work out as planned when Sir Vince delivered his speech, with him becoming a bit tongue-tied and mangling the words:Not quite the ""erotic spasm"" phrase @vincecable https://t.co/WMy4q6UWFv #politicslive pic.twitter.com/Afup8YumrTEnd of Twitter post  by @BBCPoliticsWhat could be more fun than dancing around a hotel function room with a bunch of political activists to tracks chosen by the party's current and former MPs? I for one steered well clear of the now somewhat legendary Lib Dem disco, but apparently it was Christine Jardine who won the sound clash by playing it safe with reliable floor-fillers from ABBA, Blondie and Whitney Houston.  ""It's like a wedding,"" said one person there. If the bar was free, we might've been tempted. "
2018-09-18,Poll watching,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45520517,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK narrowly voted in favour of Leave in the EU referendum, but with six months to go until Brexit, where does the country stand now?From whether the UK should hold another referendum, to what Brexit means for the economy, the opinion polls reveal a great deal about what the country thinks.Immediately before last year's general election, as many people thought the government was handling the negotiations well as felt it was doing so badly. But confidence fell away quickly when Theresa May lost her Commons majority. By last autumn nearly three times as many people thought the government was handling things badly (61%) as believed it was doing a good job (22%). Since the cabinet reached the Chequers agreement on how to handle the UK's future relationship with the EU, that ratio has increased further - to five to one. Leave voters have become much more critical, with only about 20% thinking the government is doing well, compared with 70% who feel it is doing badly.But voters are critical not only of the government. The polling organisation NatCen recently found 57% think the EU is handling the talks badly, while only 16% believe it is doing well.Meanwhile, polls consistently find that voters are still more likely to trust the Conservatives than Labour on the issue. Voters have also become increasingly pessimistic about how good a deal the UK will get. Until last year's general election, more people agreed than disagreed that the prime minister would secure a good deal, but thereafter, monthly polls have suggested that only about a third think the UK will get the right deal, while nearly half do not. Confidence fell yet further after the Chequers agreement. In ORB's most recent poll just 22% agreed that the prime minister will get the right deal, while 59% disagreed.Unsurprisingly, those who voted Remain have long been pessimistic. Even as long ago as September 2016, only 17% thought the UK would secure a good outcome.But doubts are now also widespread among Leave voters. According to NatCen, 40% now think the UK will get a bad deal, while just 22% reckon it will get a good one.More voters think that Brexit will be bad for the economy than believe it will be beneficial. That was also the position before the referendum. However, despite the continuing debate about the economic consequences of Brexit, the balance of opinion has shifted little. According to ICM's most recent poll, 44% of people think Brexit will be bad for the economy. That is an almost identical proportion to the 43% who held that view 18 months ago.But attitudes towards the economic consequences do seem to influence whether voters would vote the same way in another referendum.  Only about half of Leave voters who now think that Brexit will be bad for the economy would vote the same way again, a recent NatCen survey found. And only two-fifths of Remain voters who now think the economy will be better off after Brexit would vote to stay in the EU again.Immigration was a key issue for many of those who voted Leave in 2016, in part due to the EU's rules on freedom of movement.  However, some recent polling has suggested that the level of concern has declined. The proportion of people who think the rules on immigration should be the same for EU residents as those from elsewhere in the world fell from 74% in autumn 2016 to 59% now, according to NatCen.But many polls suggest voters remain more or less evenly divided over whether it is more important for the UK to end freedom of movement or stay in the EU's single market.  While most Remain supporters think it is more important to stay in the single market, most of those who voted Leave think ending freedom of movement is more important.Please upgrade your browserRead the full glossary here Before last year's general election, polls that asked people how they would vote if the referendum question was asked again often found a small majority in favour of Leave. But since then, nearly every poll has found a small majority saying that they would vote Remain. However, there is no consistent evidence suggesting that support for Remain has subsequently increased further. The UK remains more or less evenly divided on the merits of Brexit.Some polls find that those who voted Leave are a little less likely than those who backed Remain to say that they would vote the same way again.But this is not the only reason why there appears to have been a small swing to Remain since the referendum. All polls find that those who did not vote in 2016 - in some cases because they were too young to do so - are more likely to say they would vote Remain rather than Leave. So, should another referendum ever be held, the outcome might well depend on who turns out.More like thisWhether people support a second referendum depends on what they are asked.Polls that ask whether voters should have the final say on Brexit typically find more support for the idea than those that simply ask if there should be another referendum.Similarly, polls that ask whether there should be another ballot tend to find more support than those specifying the choice would be between accepting whatever deal is agreed and remaining in the EU.  The question that has been asked most often is: ""Do you think there should be a second referendum to accept or reject the terms of Britain's exit from the EU once they have been agreed?""This idea has gradually become more popular - even more so in the wake of the Chequers agreement. But there may still not be a majority in favour.Unsurprisingly perhaps, this is an issue on which Remain and Leave supporters disagree. Irrespective of how they ask about it, polls typically find that around two-thirds of Remain voters would like another ballot However, the majority - maybe as many as two-thirds - of those who backed Leave are against the idea.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.Sir John Curtice is professor of politics at Strathclyde University, senior fellow at NatCen Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.

As the leading UK-wide party campaigning to stop Brexit they should be the voice of the 48% who voted Remain in 2016.But they are struggling to get out of single figures in the opinion polls. Their leader, Sir Vince Cable, has proposed some drastic remedies - transforming the party into a ""movement for moderates"" with new supporters, and opening up the next leadership contest to ""talent"" from outside the party.Sir Vince is also talking to disgruntled Labour and Conservative MPs, who he says are ready to break away from their parties in significant numbers as key Brexit votes loom in the Commons.At a Q&A session in the main hall in Brighton on Sunday, former MP Liz Lynne asked Sir Vince if all this was going to end with a new centre-ground movement led by someone like self-styled moderate Labour MP Chuka Ummuna, under a new name, and then, she added, ""the Liberal Democrats are dead"". An exasperated Sir Vince told Ms Lynne she was getting way ahead of herself. ""People are thinking of the person they hate the most and saying if they were the leader I could not possibly put up with it,"" he said.But there was no leadership contest planned in the near future, he told the audience, and if the party accepted his changes there would be robust systems to weed out unsuitable leadership candidates from outside the party.He was quite happy with the Liberal Democrat name, but if members wanted to change it that was fine too.But why not dissolve the party and form a new one, if it would help stop Brexit, which they all appear to agree is the top priority? Tom Cole, policy director of the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a second referendum and a Lib Dem member, did not rule out the idea, but could see some practical problems.""If there was a new party to be created, you would have to do it pretty quickly. Who knows how things will develop and evolve in the coming weeks and months?""I don't necessarily think you have to have one political party just focusing on that and nothing else. Questions arise about what should the party's position be on other policies. What happens if you are successful? Do you dissolve the party and go back to what it was before?""He insists People's Vote is not the forerunner of a new party as some have claimed.Ed Bird, of Waltham Forest Lib Dems said: ""The Lib Dems are not a one-issue party. It can't be just a Brexit party but there is no reason different political parties couldn't come together.""The reason anti-Brexit Labour MPs were not flocking to the Lib Dems, he argued, was because ""we are damned by the coalition with the Tories"". ""No Labour people want to get involved with us directly,"" although that is changing, he claims.""I think people are beginning to realise that we are not part of the Tory party and we are not going to jump into bed with the Tory party. We will perhaps move forward with pacts with the Labour Party, or something different, if necessary.""His friend, Bob Sullivan, is no fan of a new party but could see the Lib Dems working with other parties in Parliament to fight Brexit.""When you see (anti-Brexit Tory MP) Anna Soubry, she's brilliant. And so is Chuka. They are brilliant people within their own parties but they totally disagree with their party's stance on Brexit. ""So what would you do as a leader of the Liberal Democrats? You would be talking to them. How would you get us to come together on this issue and work together. The Liberal Democrats always like to work together with others.""Amna Ahmad, who was the Lib Dem candidate in Sutton and Cheam at last year's general election, said: ""We need to work with the current structures we have.""There were a lot of organisations, like People's Vote, trying to influence MPs over Brexit but none of them has so far stood candidates in elections, she says.""We live in a social media age, citizen power, but we still have a Parliamentary democracy and the people making the decisions are the ones there. I don't think it's about a new party that would stop Brexit. it's not as simple as that.""Caron Lindsay, of West Lothian Lib Dems, said: ""You don't actually need people to join a new party to stop Brexit. ""All you need is a majority of the MPs in the House of Commons to vote down Theresa May's deal and vote for a People's Vote. And we have been leading the arguments on that all along.""Richard Kemp, of Liverpool Walton Lib Dems, said he was happy to work with some Labour councillors but did not want to waste time ""pratting around"" with the formation of a new party.""There are 10 Labour MPs I wouldn't mind joining us. I wouldn't want more than that. We wouldn't be the Liberal Democrat party with Liberal Democrat traditions,"" he says.As for dissolving the party and starting again as a new centre-ground force, he said: ""The time for any of us to leave was during the coalition. ""I said then, and I'll say it now, you'll drag my Liberal Democrat membership card out of my cold dead hand. For Liberals who are democrats there is nowhere else for us to go."""

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.3%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-18,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign.

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-09-19,EU 'ready to improve' Brexit border offer,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45566205,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May says the EU must ""evolve"" its stance on the Irish border as she prepares to make the case for her Brexit plans to other European leaders.In Salzburg, the PM welcomed the EU's recognition its initial proposal to avoid a hard border in Ireland was ""unacceptable"". It comes after EU negotiator Michel Barnier suggested a shift in tone on his controversial ""backstop"" plan.Mrs May said her own Chequers plan would ensure ""frictionless trade"".The UK and EU both want to avoid a hard border - meaning any physical infrastructure like cameras or guard posts - but can't agree on how.Mrs May has previously rejected the EU's ""backstop"" plan - which involves keeping Northern Ireland aligned with its trading rules - saying it would divide up the UK.Ahead of the Salzburg summit, Mr Barnier said most checks could take place away from border areas, an apparent concession to the UK. But another key EU figure, European Council President Donald Tusk, said the UK's own plans ""will need to be reworked"".Addressing reporters as she arrived for dinner in the Austrian city, Mrs May said her blueprint for future relations was ""the only credible and negotiable plan on the table that delivers no hard border in Northern Ireland"".She added: ""If we're going to achieve a successful conclusion then, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to evolve its position too.""After Brexit, the 310 mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become the UK's border with the EU. At the moment, thousands of people cross it every day for both work and pleasure - as do goods, like food and medicines, being delivered across the two countries.As part of the EU single market and customs union, these products do not need to be checked for customs and standards, but when the UK leaves these two arrangements, this all changes.Nobody wants a hard border for the checks - in fact the 1998 Good Friday agreement, which helped bring peace to Northern Ireland, got rid of security checks as part of the deal, and police in Northern Ireland have warned reinstating them could make crossings targets for violence. But there is no agreement between the UK and EU, or between Leavers and Remainers, about the answer. Privately, EU officials say those checks could be carried out by British or EU officials, or by health inspectors rather than customs officials, to ""de-dramatise"" the border issue.Mrs May has insisted there needs to be ""friction-free movement of goods"", with no customs or regulatory checks, between Northern Ireland and the Republic, in order to avoid a hard border there.There are just over six months to go before the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.Negotiations are at a critical stage, with both sides hoping for an agreement on the terms of the UK's withdrawal and future trade relations by the start of November at the latest.Please upgrade your browserSpeaking on Tuesday, Mr Barnier said the talks were in the ""home straight"" but there were still significant areas of disagreement - such as on the role of the European Court of Justice in enforcing the withdrawal agreement and intellectual property issues, including geographical protections for food and drink.""October is the key point in time - it is the moment of truth,"" he added. The EU is still insisting on its own ""legally operationally backstop"" - what it describes as an insurance policy to prevent the return of physical infrastructure on the border in the event no other solution can be found.Brussels put forward a proposal in February that would see Northern Ireland stay aligned with the EU in key areas, effectively staying in the customs union and single market and not needing those border checks.But the UK insisted this was unacceptable as it would split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK.On Tuesday Mr Barnier said the backstop should focus on a ""set of technical checks and controls"" to make sure standards are met and customs are paid, and not be about a sea or land border. ""We are ready to improve this proposal,"" he said.""Work on the EU side is ongoing. We are clarifying which goods arriving in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked and where, when and by whom these checks could be performed.""We can also clarify that most checks can take place away from the border at a company premises or at the markets.""BBC Northern Ireland business editor John Campbell said that the fact the EU was prepared to ""improve"" the language of the backstop was not news as it had been talked about before - so ""we need to wait and see what any improvements might amount to"".Speaking in Salzburg, Mr Tusk confirmed a special EU summit dedicated to Brexit would take place in mid-November.He welcomed some elements of the Chequers proposals - on security and policing - but said that on the Irish border and economic cooperation they will need to be ""reworked and further negotiated"".At the dinner in Salzburg, Mrs May is expected to appeal for ""goodwill and determination"" from the EU, while stressing that ""no other country"" could accept the EU's backstop plan if they were in the same situation.The UK put forward rival backstop proposals in June, which would see the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU after the end of the proposed Brexit transition period in December 2020.It also says its Chequers blueprint for a future trading relationship - involving a ""common rulebook"" for goods and treating the UK and the EU as a ""combined customs territory"" - would provide the solution to the border question.Former Brexit secretary David Davis said the EU was shifting its position by accepting checks could take place away from the border.Mr Davis, who resigned in protest at the Chequers plan, told the Today programme he did not ""expect much"" from the Salzburg summit, predicting it would be November - and with the threat of no deal looming - before the EU shifted its position.He said the EU's ""standard approach"" to negotiations was to ""pocket everything"" and give ground at the last minute, ""after they've tested your mettle"".The DUP's Nigel Dodds said: ""So Michel Barnier says he can do different kinds of checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK as if that makes it more palatable.""The fundamental point is that internal UK checks are only needed if it is intended to separate Northern Ireland from Great Britain.""Labour MP Owen Smith, from the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said: ""The DUP look to have sunk Barnier's improved offer on Northern Ireland before he has even floated it.""In an interview with the Daily Express, Mrs May said that going back on the 2016 vote to leave the EU would ""destroy trust in politicians"".MPs had decided to give people a vote on EU membership by a large margin, she said: ""People weren't saying it's the choice of the public except if we disagree with the answer we'll ask them again.""The People's Vote campaign wants the final terms of Brexit to be put to a referendum with the option of staying in the EU if it is rejected.""My answer to the People's Vote is that we've had the people's vote - it was the referendum - and now we should deliver on it,"" the prime minister said.On Tuesday People's Vote set out ways they said a new referendum could be achieved through votes in Parliament."
2018-09-19,PM: Make people proud of council houses,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45569453,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPeople who live in council houses should be made to feel proud of their homes, Theresa May has said.The PM announced Â£2bn to build new homes in England, in an attempt to remove the ""stigma"" of social housing.Under the plan, housing associations, councils and other organisations will be able to bid for the money to spend on new projects, starting from 2022.Labour said the announcement fell ""far short"" of what was needed for the social housing sector.BBC home editor Mark Easton said the government hopes the money will allow local authorities and housing associations to build schemes that would otherwise seem too risky.He said the sector's calls to provide more confidence about future funding - so the 300,000 extra homes required in England each year can be built - had appeared to have been listened to.Mrs May told a National Housing Federation summit in London: ""Some residents feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority.""On the outside, many people in society - including too many politicians - continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home.""She will encourage housing associations to change how tenants and society view social housing.""We should never see social housing as something that need simply be 'good enough', nor think that the people who live in it should be grateful for their safety net and expect no better,"" she said.""I want to see social housing that is so good people are proud to call it their home... our friends and neighbours who live in social housing are not second-rate citizens.""In mixed developments, she said it should be impossible to tell the difference between full-price and affordable housing, which should not be ""tucked away out of sight and out of mind"".David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said the prime minister's announcement was ""extremely welcome"".""This represents a total step change. For years, the way that money was allocated meant housing associations couldn't be sure of long-term funding to build much-needed affordable housing,"" he said.He said that by changing the way the funding was allocated, ministers had given ""long-term confidence and confirmed that we are trusted partners in solving the housing crisis, building new homes and communities"".Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said it was welcome that the government was ""starting to get serious"" about correcting the ""historic failure"" to build social homes.""This must be the start and not the end,"" she said.Shadow housing secretary John Healey said the reality was spending on new affordable homes had been ""slashed"" and the number of new social rented homes built last year ""fell to the lowest level since records began"".""If Conservative ministers are serious about fixing the housing crisis they should back Labour's plans to build a million genuinely affordable homes, including the biggest council house-building programme for more than 30 years,"" he said.The English housing survey for 2016/17 reported that 3.9 million households - about nine million people - lived in the social rented sector, which was 17% of households in the country.The funding covers the next spending review period, from 2021 through to 2028.Downing Street said the money was separate to the Â£9bn of public funding put toward the existing affordable homes programme until 2022."
2018-09-19,UK inflation hits six-month high of 2.7%,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45572856,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK inflation rate unexpectedly rose in August to 2.7%, the highest level in six months.Economists had expected a Consumer Prices Index rate of 2.4%. The pound rose after the data was released by the Office for National Statistics.Wages are still rising more than inflation, with data last week showing wages, excluding bonuses, grew by 2.9% in the three months to July.Rising prices for recreational goods, transport and clothing drove the rise.In July, CPI was 2.5%, , which had been the first jump in the index since November.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: ""Consumers paid more for theatre shows, sea fares and new season autumn clothing last month. ""However, mobile phone charges, and furniture and household goods had a downward effect on inflation.""Prices rose less sharply for furniture, household goods and communications.The year-on-year rise in CPI in August meant that inflation was narrowing the gap with wage increases, with economists waiting for the August earnings figures.Alastair Neame, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: ""Today's inflation data show the rate of price growth accelerated in August, and may well prove to have exceeded total earnings growth in the same period. Unless UK workers can increase their productivity, this trend is likely to continue - squeezing living standards over the medium term."" The pound rose to $1.32 following the news, its highest level since July, before  falling back under $1.3140 following comments by Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, over the Irish border question.""The numbers reinforce expectations that policymakers will gently lift interest rates over the next couple of years,"" said Ben Brettell at Hargreaves Lansdown.The Bank of England raised its key interest rate for only the second time in a decade last month. The current interest rate of 0.75% is the highest since March 2009.It has also forecast that inflation will fall back to the target rate of 2% by 2020.""The figures won't come as welcome news to the Bank of England, though - they'll be desperate to leave policy unchanged until we get some clarity over Brexit and won't want to be forced into a rate rise by accelerating prices,"" said Mr Brettell.The CPI measure reached 3.1% in November 2017, when price rises were fuelled by the weakness in the pound following Brexit vote.In August, the largest change in prices was in the cultural services sector, where theatre tickets rose, and also games, toys and hobbies, while prices for computer goods rose after falling a year ago.The ONS said transport costs as a component of inflation increased, largely because of rises in sea and air fares. Petrol prices, though, rose by 1.4 pence between July and August, less than the 1.8 pence rise of a year earlier.The average price of clothing and footwear rose 3.1% between July and August, faster than the 2.4% a year before. While clothing prices usually rise between July and August, the ONS said women's and children's clothing drove the rise.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the fact that the inflation rise was fuelled by reaction and cultural goods meant it would be temporary: ""We would expect this to unwind in next month's release.""The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, was 3.5% in August, up from 3.2% in July."
2018-09-19,'Wild West' Bitcoin 'should be regulated',https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45558593,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBitcoin and other digital currencies are a ""Wild West industry"" and need to be regulated to protect investors, a committee of MPs has urged.Problems include volatile prices, minimal consumer protection and risks of hacking and money-laundering, says the Treasury Committee.The committee said there were no well-functioning crypto-currencies and preferred to call them ""crypto-assets"".It urged City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority to supervise them.At present, the FCA has no power to regulate either the issuers of these assets or the exchanges on which they are traded.""Crypto-asset investors are currently afforded very little protection from the litany of risks. Namely, there are no formal mechanisms for consumer redress, nor compensation,"" said the committee. There are now more than 1,500 varieties of crypto-asset being traded on about 190 exchanges around the world. Prices have soared and crashed alarmingly. In 2017, the price of a Bitcoin rocketed to nearly Â£15,000 before losing two-thirds of its value in just a few months. Crypto-fundraising schemes, known as Initial Coin Offerings, have posed challenges for regulators around the world.""As the government and regulators decide whether the current Wild West situation is allowed to continue, or whether they are going to introduce regulation, consumers remain unprotected,"" said the Treasury Committee. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the committee, said: ""It's unsustainable for the government and regulators to bumble along issuing feeble warnings to potential investors, yet refrain from acting. ""At a minimum, regulation should address consumer protection and anti-money-laundering.""CryptoUK, which was set up in February as a self-regulatory body for the crypto-currency industry, said it welcomed the Treasury Committee's recommendations.Iqbal Gandham, who chairs it, said: ""Self-regulation by the industry was always intended to be a starting point - this must now be matched by government action. ""Regulatory oversight is essential to ensuring consumer safety, guarding against malpractice and providing much needed clarity to an industry that is fast maturing. ""It is therefore pleasing that the committee has endorsed our suggestion on how this can be delivered, by bringing responsibility within the FCA's perimeter of oversight."" "
2018-09-19,Brexit is not inevitable - Cable,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45553411,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window""Brexit is not inevitable - it can and it must be stopped,"" Sir Vince Cable has told his party's annual conference.The Lib Dem leader said 29 March next year - the date the UK is set to leave the EU - was ""only a maybe"".He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit will be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario.And he urged Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Mrs May has said there will not be another referendum ""under any circumstances"" and Mr Corbyn has said he would prefer a general election.Sir Vince spoke for 45 minutes and received a standing ovation from the party faithful in the Brighton conference centre for what was a sombre, thoughtful address with few jokes.Some of the loudest cheers came when he said Jeremy Corbyn should resign as Labour leader if he does not agree to demands from his own MPs and party members for a referendum on the final Brexit deal at their party conference next week.""If Jeremy Corbyn will not say 'I will support a People's Vote and I will fight Brexit', Labour members should wave him goodbye,"" said Sir Vince.""He is currently letting down the many people in Labour's heartland who now see Brexit for what it is. It's a Tory project, pursued for Tory ends, of which working people will be the main victims.""He described Tory Brexiteers like Jacob Rees-Mogg, as ""fundamentalists"" for which ""the costs of Brexit have always been irrelevant"".He was due to say that ""years of economic pain justified by the erotic spasm of leaving the European Union. Economic pain felt - of course - not by them by those least able to afford it.""However Sir Vince mangled the ""erotic spasm"" line that had grabbed most of the overnight headlines:The Lib Dem leader took aim at what he described as Tory ""chancers"" like Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, who he said had only backed Brexit to further their own leadership ambitions. He said Mr Johnson was a ""real danger to Britain"", comparing him with US President Donald Trump.""He doesn't just resemble Trump - large, loud and blonde - he behaves more like him by the day.""Their cynical disregard for the truth, their treatment of women, and their inflammatory divisive language make Boris and Donald the 'terrible twins of the rabid right'.""Mr Gove, on the other hand, was the ""ideal man for a penalty shoot out - right to the last moment you never know which way he will go"".The Lib Dem leader, who has said he will step down when Brexit has been ""resolved or stopped"", has put the chances of another referendum at about ""30%"".But he is talking to anti-Brexit Labour and Conservative MPs about how to get a second referendum, possibly by tabling a new bill or an amendment to legislation already going through Parliament, with proposed referendum questions.He claimed Theresa May, who voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum but has vowed to deliver on the will of the people, knows ""deep down"" that Brexit is a ""bad idea"" whose ""time has gone"".He urged her to show ""true leadership"" by admitting that staying in the EU will be better than any deal she can get in Brussels.""Instead of kowtowing to her enemies in the Conservative Party, she could lead her party and the country by opening her mind to a 'People's Vote' on the final deal"", he said. The Lib Dem leader also used his speech to set out a vision of a ""liberal future"" for Britain after the ""Brexit nightmare"" has been stopped, vowing to ""restore a sense of fairness and opportunity to a country where both have been lost"".He set out plans, announced at the weekend, to set up a Â£100bn citizens' fund to spread the UK's wealth more evenly, paid for, in part, by abolishing inheritance tax and replacing it with a ""levy on large financial gifts received over a lifetime"".The Lib Dems would also increase taxes on the wealthy, tackle homelessness, solve the housing crisis and combat racism, while controlling immigration, he said, referring to his ""personal experience of racism"" in the late 1960s.""My wife and children were being denounced as people whose very presence here would lead to rivers foaming with blood. And I was thrown out of the parental home,"" he told his party conference.Sir Vince also used his speech to set out plans to transform his party, which has 12 MPs and has languished in the opinion polls since being in coalition with the Tories, into a ""movement for moderates"" and open up its next leadership contest to non-MPs.He said the party was still ""very pale and very male"", adding: ""We must change that and keep growing."""
2018-09-19,'Multiple chances' for new Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45566204,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs will have ""multiple"" opportunities to give the public the final say over whether the UK leaves the EU, the People's Vote campaign group has said.Theresa May has ruled out a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations under any circumstances.But People's Vote said there were six plausible scenarios in which Parliament could legislate for another vote.It said there should be a choice for voters between leaving with or without a deal or staying on current terms.The prime minister says the UK made its choice to leave in 2016 and that her plan for future co-operation with the EU - based on the Chequers blueprint agreed in July - respects the referendum result.She has said the choice facing Parliament is between leaving with or without a comprehensive agreement. But in a report called Roadmap to a People's Vote the group campaigning for a referendum on any Brexit deal said there were no practical or legal barriers to giving the public the final say through a referendum and urged MPs not to hide behind ""logistical arguments"".  The British public voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.89% to 48.11% in a referendum in June 2016. The UK is scheduled to leave on 29 March 2019, under the terms of the two-year Article 50 process. Negotiations on the terms of the UK's withdrawal, the so-called divorce settlement, as well as the shape of future relations between the two sides are now at a critical stage.European leaders meeting in Salzburg on Wednesday are expected to agree to hold a special summit in November at which any deal sealed in the next six weeks could be approved.Parliament will then be expected to vote on the terms of any agreement before the end of the year.People's Vote said this Commons showdown, when it happened, could be a catalyst for securing a referendum. The six ways it believes a referendum could be delivered are:Lord Kerr, the former top civil servant who wrote the report, said MPs who wanted a referendum faced a ""high bar"" given the government's control of the Parliamentary timetable.But he pointed out that Mrs May, who relies on the Democratic Unionist Party for her slim Commons majority, had already suffered two Brexit defeats and if Parliament did not act ""it will not be due to procedural impediments or a lack of time but because MPs have not chosen to take these opportunities"".The cross-bench peer said the government could easily seek an extension of the Article 50 process to allow for a referendum by ""withdrawing"" the letter sent on 29 March 2017 notifying the EU of its intention to leave. ""The die is not irrevocably cast,"" he wrote. ""There is still time. If there is a majority in Parliament for a People's Vote, there are multiple routes to securing one and, as the process unfolds, more opportunities for the House of Commons to assert its will may emerge.""In terms of what question would be asked, People's Vote said it did not rule out having three options on the ballot paper - namely any deal agreed by the two sides, leaving without a deal or staying in on current terms.But it said this was unlikely to get the backing of MPs and a ""binary choice"" between two options would be clearer, simpler and quicker.While there was a case for giving 16-year olds the vote and allowing EU nationals living in the UK to take part, it said there might be ""practical limits"" on any changes to the franchise given the timescale involved.The Lib Dems, the SNP and a growing number of Labour MPs back the idea of a referendum but Jeremy Corbyn has not committed to one as yet and only a handful of Tories support it."
2018-09-19,Call to scrap high-skilled migrants cap,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45556246,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe cap on the number of high-skilled migrants coming to the UK should be scrapped, according to a key report commissioned by the government ahead of Brexit.The Migration Advisory Committee says these workers make a more positive contribution to the public finances. It suggests EU workers should be subject to the same visa rules as other migrants.But it notes the UK might offer them special status under a Brexit deal.The government has said it will ""carefully consider"" the committee's proposals. Labour backed the report, calling for an ""end to discrimination"" against non-EU migrants.  Under the current system, workers from the European Economic Area (EEA) - which includes all EU countries including the UK, as well as Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein - enjoy freedom of movement, travelling and working within the area without visas. The committee recommends a policy allowing greater access for higher-skilled migration while restricting access for lower-skilled workers. It suggests extending the current scheme for high-skilled non-EEA migrants - known as a Tier 2 visa - to those from EEA countries as well.As part of this process, the cap on the total amount of workers allowed to enter under Tier 2 should be abolished and the range of jobs eligeable for the visas expanded, the committee says. Current policy is to allow 20,700 high-skilled workers into the UK each year on Tier 2 visas. The current salary threshold for such visas is Â£30,000, which the report says should be retained. Top priority is given to jobs on a ""shortage occupation list"".Examples include:With regard to low-skilled workers, the committee says it is ""not convinced there needs to be a work route for low-skilled workers"" from the EU to fill jobs in industries such as catering or hospitality.The ""possible exception"" to this rule could be for seasonal agriculture, where 99% of the workers come from EU countries. It also does not recommend that there should be exceptions for workers coming to the UK to work in the public sector. The committee - which is made up of independent experts, says it does not seen any ""compelling reasons to offer a different set of rules"" for workers from the EEA than those from other countries - unless such a position has been arrived at as part of the Brexit negotiations. ""A migrant's impact depends on factors such as their skills, employment, age and use of public services, and not fundamentally on their nationality,"" it says. The report goes on to say there is no evidence that increased European migration has damaged life in the UK. It concludes that EU migrants pay more in tax than they receive in benefits, contribute more to the NHS workforce than the healthcare they access, and have no effect on crime rates. It says the impact of all EEA migration to the UK since 2004 was almost certainly less than that of the fall in the value of the pound following the referendum vote.By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondentMinisters commissioned this report because they needed clear facts on the role of European workers in the country - and the implications of ending their freedom of movement. But it's too soon to know how many of the committee's recommendations will be adopted because of the Brexit elephant in the room.So while the experts want no special immigration deal for future EU workers (the report does not concern those who are already living in the UK), it doesn't consider whether a special deal would be good or bad for Britain.Such a deal is a possibility. The prime minister's Chequers plan proposes a ""mobility framework"" - a system allowing British and EU citizens to study and work in each other countries, potentially linked to a trade deal.So if the ministers offer special access for future EU workers, in return for something they want for the UK, this report won't help us know whether it is worth it. The MAC was asked to do the research in July 2017 by then Home Secretary Amber Rudd.It is thought it could shape the government's post-Brexit immigration policy. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May might start ""sketching out"" her plans for this at October's Conservative Party conference.He added that the report would increase pressure on her to not compromise on freedom of movement during the Brexit negotiations. Please upgrade your browserStephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said if the recommendations were adopted, it would signal ""the biggest change to the UK labour market in a generation"" and would represent a ""huge shift"" for sectors such as hotels and food manufacturing.He said: ""If enacted, these proposals would effectively end low-skilled migration, while prioritising mid- and high-skill migration in areas where we have labour shortages. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the recommendations, saying the UK had long depended on recruiting nursing professionals from around the world.But Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the report was ""blind to the impact"" of EU migration to a number of communities. He said the proposals would ""permit continued high levels of immigration"" and ""the overall outcome would be to weaken immigration control"".The government says it will listen to the report and bring in an immigration system that works for the whole of the UK, adding: ""EU citizens play an important and positive role in our economy and society and we want that to continue after we leave"".Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the UK's immigration policy should be ""based on our economic needs, while meeting our legal obligations and treating people fairly"".""[This] means ending the discrimination against non-EU migrants, especially from the Commonwealth,"" she added. But Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the report was ""puzzling"" with ""significant gaps"" between the MAC's research and recommendations. ""The MAC admit they have ignored the crucial relationship between immigration and trade,"" she said. Without analysis on relationship between trade & immigration, and on how to address impact on key sectors like social care, Parliament & Govt still doesnât have the info it needs to inform the negotiations & future plansEnd of Twitter post  by @YvetteCooperMPThe report comes as figures for 2017, showed that net migration from the EU was at its lowest level since 2012 - with overall net migration at 282,000.The government wants to cut overall net migration to the tens of thousands."

But sceptics have expressed concern about opening up the UK market to imports of US products such as chlorine-washed chicken, and the NHS to American health firms.People behind the ""ideal US-UK free trade agreement"" - which was edited by Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan - say it would eliminate trade barriers and ""stimulate innovation"" - but environmental campaigners described it as a ""low-standards free-for-all"".Launching it in London, primary author Dan Ikenson from the Cato Institute said the document was ""somewhat idealistic"" and ""pie in the sky"".""It doesn't pay a whole lot of attention to political realities,"" he said, adding that his approach would be to ""put everything on the table except the issues that are going to be most politically difficult to overcome"".Mr Ikenson acknowledged concerns about the NHS, saying the UK government would have the option of ""carving out"" the health service as an exemption.Aside from a limited number of exemptions, under the proposals all public procurement would be open to competition from the other country.It also calls for EU-style free movement to apply between the UK and the US. Asked about immigration concerns that drove some people to vote for Brexit in 2016, Mr Ikenson said there were similar views in the US, saying his proposed model would be conditional on a job offer and workers would be given a deadline to return if they were made redundant.""This is not immigration run roughshod,"" he said.The report also suggests that in areas such as consumer safety, workers' rights and the environment, businesses could only have to comply with one country's regulations in order to eliminate barriers to free trade.It says this would allow firms to achieve economies of scale and cut prices.But Amy Mount of the Greener UK coalition said: ""Flooding our supermarkets with chlorinated chicken, undercutting our farmers and lowering environmental standards would be a strange way to take back control. ""The UK has benefited from trade deals that embrace high standards, and enjoyed high quality food and safer products as a result. Our blueprint for post-Brexit trade should be defined by a lighter footprint on the global environment, not a low-standards free-for-all.""The IFT was launched last year by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, but the report's authors said they had not been involved in drawing up the suggested trade deal, which was described as a non-partisan project.Asked who paid for the report, Mr Ikenson said the Cato Institute had a ""diversity of funding"", with 80% from private donors."
2018-09-19,BMW to shut Mini plant for month post-Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45561908,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Mini factory in Oxford will shut down for a month after Brexit at the end of March to minimise disruption in case of a no-deal outcome.Owner BMW said its summer maintenance shutdown had been brought forward to 1 April to reduce any ""possible short-term parts-supply disruption"". ""While we believe this worst case scenario is an unlikely outcome, we have to plan for it,"" BMW said.The German firm said it ""remained committed"" to its UK operations.The Cowley plant, on the outskirts of Oxford, will remain open in April with maintenance, management and catering staff continuing to work despite no cars being made. It employs 4,500 people and produces 5,000 cars a week.BMW said the downtime would be used to start preparing the plant to make the new electric Mini. The concern is that in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the borders and shortages of parts.Hundreds of lorries a day arrive at Cowley with parts from across the world, with 60% of components coming from the EU.Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondentFactory shutdowns are common in the car industry. Machinery needs to be repaired or replaced and updates or modifications to production lines carried out. Usually at Mini this happens during the summer and is built into the carmaker's output planning.What BMW has done is simply reschedule that shutdown to coincide with a potential period of serious disruption at the borders after Brexit, if we leave the EU without a deal. If the plant is not actually making cars, then a shortage of imported parts should not be so much of a problem. The company says a no-deal outcome is unlikely, but has to be planned for. Rescheduling the annual shutdown looks like a relatively simple and inexpensive piece of contingency planning. Nevertheless, it does send out a political message. It's a reminder that carmakers are particularly reliant on frictionless borders, to ensure parts arrive where they're needed at exactly the right time. And it shows that BMW is taking the risk of a no-deal Brexit seriously.Add that to comments made by the Jaguar Land Rover boss last week suggesting that the wrong Brexit deal could cost tens of thousands of jobs, and it suggests that people within the industry are getting rather nervous right now. Other carmakers with British operations have warned that a bad or no Brexit deal would be damaging for the UK car industry.Earlier on Tuesday, the head of Honda Europe, Ian Howells, told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would cost his company tens of millions of pounds.""In terms of administration, we'd probably be looking at something like sixty odd thousand additional bits of documentation we would have to provide to get product to and from Europe,"" Mr Howells told BBC Radio 5 live.""And clearly if we end up with World Trade Organization tariffs we'd have something like 10% costs in addition on our shipped product back into Europe, and that would certainly run into tens of millions of pounds.""Last week, Jaguar Land Rover boss Ralf Speth warned the government to get ""the right Brexit"" or it could wipe out profits at the carmaker and lead to big job cuts.On Tuesday the company said about 1,000 workers at its Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham would move from a five-day to a three-day week from October until Christmas.JLR - the UK's largest carmaker - said it was making ""temporary adjustments"" to its production schedules at the factory, which produces Jaguar cars."

Ian Howells told the BBC that quitting the bloc without an agreement would affect the carmaker's competitiveness in Europe. He said the Japanese firm was preparing for a no-deal outcome but had not discussed relocating its Swindon plant. The firm builds its Civic model in Britain for the global market. In an interview with Radio 5 live, Mr Howells said a no-deal Brexit would lead to costly trade barriers and disrupt its supply chain.""In terms of administration, we'd probably be looking at something like sixty odd thousand additional bits of documentation we would have to provide to get product to and from Europe,"" he told the Wake up to Money programme.""And clearly if we end up with World Trade Organization tariffs we'd have something like 10% costs in addition on our shipped product back into Europe, and that would certainly run into tens of millions of pounds.""""Likewise when we're looking at componentry coming the other way, again [it could cost] tens of millions in terms of tariffs coming into the UK.""Like other carmakers in Britian, Honda only stores about an hour's worth of components at its Swindon plant to keep costs down.Instead it relies on about 350 truckloads of parts that are delivered from the continent each day. Mr Howells said the loss of ""frictionless trade"" in this supply chain would harm its production output and competitiveness.  ""If we are shipping and competing against a European manufacturer in Europe, they are not incurring those tariffs,"" he said. ""And in the UK it would be the componentry cost that would be the main additional burden we would have to carry for UK customers.""A host of carmakers in Britain, including Nissan and Jaguar, have warned a bad or no Brexit deal would be damaging for the UK car industry.EU customers buy about â¬15bn ($18.5bn; Â£13bn) worth of British-made cars per year, accounting for 53% of the UK's vehicle exports.However, despite uncertainty over a future trade deal, carmakers such as Nissan, BMW and Toyota have committed to expanding production in Britain since the Brexit vote.Mr Howells told the BBC that Honda was preparing for a potential no-deal outcome by carrying ""a little bit more componentry than we otherwise would"" and by reviewing its production schedules. However, he added the Swindon plant manufactured for the global market, not just Europe, and that there had been no discussions about moving it. He also said the firm supported the Prime Minister's Chequer's deal, which proposes following a ""common rule book"" with the EU for trade in goods.Critics say the deal would make Britain a rule taker, not a rule maker, and hamper its ability to strike trade deals around the world. But Mr Howells said common rules for building and approving vehicles across Europe would be a ""positive"" for the car industry. "

The democracy review was sold as a way of empowering the membership and some on the left are fearful that it will instead further empower trade union leaders.Some local trade union branches have very few members while many of the branches consisting of fully-paid up individual party members are much larger.So a relatively small number of trade unionists could trigger a re-selection contest since it would be much easier to get 30% of trade union branches to give the sitting MP the thumbs down than 30% of the (often much larger) membership branches.There had been talk of a further compromise - giving less weight to smaller union branches.On the latest information I have, it looks like this further proposal may have been dropped.One NEC member suggested privately that the ""compromise"" - rather than either protecting sitting MPs or giving members a much greater say -  would in effect allow Unite chief Len McCluskey ""to pick off whoever he wants"".So even the ""compromise"" hasn't been agreed.Not knowingly undersold, one insider said ""it could be war"".There has also been a change to the initial proposal for selecting Jeremy Corbyn's eventual successor. What was floated at the last meeting of the NEC was a new system which would allow a candidate to get nominated with the backing of just 5% of MPs (the current threshold is 10%) so long as either 10% of local constituency parties, or 10% of unions, also nominated them.Today the NEC will discuss a new proposal - a future leader would require not only the support of 10% of MPs and local parties but would now also require the support of two trade unions that account for 5% of 'affiliated' members.Complicated as that is (and believe it or not, I have simplified the options) the upshot is that a leadership candidate wouldn't get on the ballot without the backing of some big unions.And some Momentum activists are complaining that this would skew power away from rank and file party members and are pledging to oppose it.Momentum has been pressing its members to deluge the NEC with emails calling for the leadership threshold to be reduced to 5% of MPs and for any compromise on parliamentary selections to be ditched.""Their phones are imploding under the weight of emails,"" one source said.The NEC is likely to be expanded to include, specifically, party members with disabilities and those from an ethnic minority  background. But the proposal today is that these new places will be elected equally by unions and rank-and-file members, not just by the party membership alone.After the last NEC meeting, a Corbyn-sceptic told me he had ""kicked into the long grass"" a proposal that the leaders of local authority Labour groups would be elected by the wider membership and not just by councils.Well, someone has got the political lawnmower out, because it's back on the agenda now.And local government manifestos might be drawn up not by councillors but wider local government committees which include trade union nominees.Under the current system when an NEC place chosen by the members (the unions, councillors, shadow cabinet and MPs/MEPs have their own dedicated places) becomes vacant, the runner up in the annual elections is automatically promoted onto the NEC.I understand an NEC member is considering standing down and that would mean comedian Eddie Izzard (who wasn't supported by the left) would be elevated. But under proposals to be discussed today a by-election, seen as unnecessarily expensive by opponents, would be held in future - increasing the chance of a left-wing replacementA proposal to have existing NEC members choose amongst themselves who joins them has been dropped.Clearly there are plenty of issues still to be agreed, but whatever backroom deals are done, or compromises concluded, it's likely by the end of Labour conference that it will be easier to replace sitting MPs and that it's even more likely that someone on the left (not necessarily the so-called 'hard left') will replace Jeremy Corbyn when the time comes.And that the tension between a vision of a ""members-led"" party which Momentum has been advocating, and one where the big trade unions retain power, will continue."

Here is what we learned from their annual conference...In case you were in any doubt about the Liberal Democrats' position on Brexit they have spent the last four days telling anyone who'll listen that it must be stopped. ""We are absolutely solid that we need to vote against Brexit and stop it,"" leader Sir Vince Cable said. How exactly they might do that is less clear, because, as it stands, if MPs vote against a deal reached by the government with the EU, the UK would leave with no agreement in place.  A ""People's Vote"" is needed, which Sir Vince told us could be arranged ""within weeks.""Despite announcing he would step down at some point before the next general election, Sir Vince told us he would be ""pretty busy for quite a long time"".  But he also said it was ""uncertain"" whether he would still be in the job by the end of next year. Nobody in Brighton seems to know exactly how much longer Sir Vince will be leader of the party, himself included. The conference has felt a bit like the start of a long goodbye to someone who has accepted he has a limited shelf-life. The Liberal Democrats don't do anything in a hurry. Even a Q&A session with their leader in the main conference hall was strictly moderated. Members were called upon to approach the ""intervention microphone"" and offered ""supplementary questions"". Some activists made it clear they weren't convinced about their leader's plan to give non-paying supporters a say in new policy and allow non-MPs to lead the party. ""We'll be dead,"" warned one, another said they could ""end up with someone like Chuka Umunna.""The campaigner and businesswoman was given star billing on Monday, with a speech in the main hall which members seemed to love. Surely if the party is hoping to attract new people, and allow non-MPs to lead them in future, Gina Miller would be a suitable candidate? Apparently not. She ruled herself out within the first minute of her speech to enthusiastic applause. Go figure. No, it's not a joke. Or a typo. And yes, he really was due to say that in his speech. Sir Vince Cable's proposed ""colourful metaphor"" to describe Britain's exit from the European Union dominated the pre-speech headlines.  He said he wouldn't ""deconstruct it in detail"" when asked exactly what he meant on the Today programme. The point was that the people Sir Vince describes as ""the true believers"" and ""fundamentalists"" were willing to take economic pain in return for the joy of leaving the EU.Unfortunately it didn't quite work out as planned when Sir Vince delivered his speech, with him becoming a bit tongue-tied and mangling the words:Not quite the ""erotic spasm"" phrase @vincecable https://t.co/WMy4q6UWFv #politicslive pic.twitter.com/Afup8YumrTEnd of Twitter post  by @BBCPoliticsWhat could be more fun than dancing around a hotel function room with a bunch of political activists to tracks chosen by the party's current and former MPs? I for one steered well clear of the now somewhat legendary Lib Dem disco, but apparently it was Christine Jardine who won the sound clash by playing it safe with reliable floor-fillers from ABBA, Blondie and Whitney Houston.  ""It's like a wedding,"" said one person there. If the bar was free, we might've been tempted. "
2018-09-19,Poll watching,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45520517,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK narrowly voted in favour of Leave in the EU referendum, but with six months to go until Brexit, where does the country stand now?From whether the UK should hold another referendum, to what Brexit means for the economy, the opinion polls reveal a great deal about what the country thinks.Immediately before last year's general election, as many people thought the government was handling the negotiations well as felt it was doing so badly. But confidence fell away quickly when Theresa May lost her Commons majority. By last autumn nearly three times as many people thought the government was handling things badly (61%) as believed it was doing a good job (22%). Since the cabinet reached the Chequers agreement on how to handle the UK's future relationship with the EU, that ratio has increased further - to five to one. Leave voters have become much more critical, with only about 20% thinking the government is doing well, compared with 70% who feel it is doing badly.But voters are critical not only of the government. The polling organisation NatCen recently found 57% think the EU is handling the talks badly, while only 16% believe it is doing well.Meanwhile, polls consistently find that voters are still more likely to trust the Conservatives than Labour on the issue. Voters have also become increasingly pessimistic about how good a deal the UK will get. Until last year's general election, more people agreed than disagreed that the prime minister would secure a good deal, but thereafter, monthly polls have suggested that only about a third think the UK will get the right deal, while nearly half do not. Confidence fell yet further after the Chequers agreement. In ORB's most recent poll just 22% agreed that the prime minister will get the right deal, while 59% disagreed.Unsurprisingly, those who voted Remain have long been pessimistic. Even as long ago as September 2016, only 17% thought the UK would secure a good outcome.But doubts are now also widespread among Leave voters. According to NatCen, 40% now think the UK will get a bad deal, while just 22% reckon it will get a good one.More voters think that Brexit will be bad for the economy than believe it will be beneficial. That was also the position before the referendum. However, despite the continuing debate about the economic consequences of Brexit, the balance of opinion has shifted little. According to ICM's most recent poll, 44% of people think Brexit will be bad for the economy. That is an almost identical proportion to the 43% who held that view 18 months ago.But attitudes towards the economic consequences do seem to influence whether voters would vote the same way in another referendum.  Only about half of Leave voters who now think that Brexit will be bad for the economy would vote the same way again, a recent NatCen survey found. And only two-fifths of Remain voters who now think the economy will be better off after Brexit would vote to stay in the EU again.Immigration was a key issue for many of those who voted Leave in 2016, in part due to the EU's rules on freedom of movement.  However, some recent polling has suggested that the level of concern has declined. The proportion of people who think the rules on immigration should be the same for EU residents as those from elsewhere in the world fell from 74% in autumn 2016 to 59% now, according to NatCen.But many polls suggest voters remain more or less evenly divided over whether it is more important for the UK to end freedom of movement or stay in the EU's single market.  While most Remain supporters think it is more important to stay in the single market, most of those who voted Leave think ending freedom of movement is more important.Please upgrade your browserRead the full glossary here Before last year's general election, polls that asked people how they would vote if the referendum question was asked again often found a small majority in favour of Leave. But since then, nearly every poll has found a small majority saying that they would vote Remain. However, there is no consistent evidence suggesting that support for Remain has subsequently increased further. The UK remains more or less evenly divided on the merits of Brexit.Some polls find that those who voted Leave are a little less likely than those who backed Remain to say that they would vote the same way again.But this is not the only reason why there appears to have been a small swing to Remain since the referendum. All polls find that those who did not vote in 2016 - in some cases because they were too young to do so - are more likely to say they would vote Remain rather than Leave. So, should another referendum ever be held, the outcome might well depend on who turns out.More like thisWhether people support a second referendum depends on what they are asked.Polls that ask whether voters should have the final say on Brexit typically find more support for the idea than those that simply ask if there should be another referendum.Similarly, polls that ask whether there should be another ballot tend to find more support than those specifying the choice would be between accepting whatever deal is agreed and remaining in the EU.  The question that has been asked most often is: ""Do you think there should be a second referendum to accept or reject the terms of Britain's exit from the EU once they have been agreed?""This idea has gradually become more popular - even more so in the wake of the Chequers agreement. But there may still not be a majority in favour.Unsurprisingly perhaps, this is an issue on which Remain and Leave supporters disagree. Irrespective of how they ask about it, polls typically find that around two-thirds of Remain voters would like another ballot However, the majority - maybe as many as two-thirds - of those who backed Leave are against the idea.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.Sir John Curtice is professor of politics at Strathclyde University, senior fellow at NatCen Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.

As the leading UK-wide party campaigning to stop Brexit they should be the voice of the 48% who voted Remain in 2016.But they are struggling to get out of single figures in the opinion polls. Their leader, Sir Vince Cable, has proposed some drastic remedies - transforming the party into a ""movement for moderates"" with new supporters, and opening up the next leadership contest to ""talent"" from outside the party.Sir Vince is also talking to disgruntled Labour and Conservative MPs, who he says are ready to break away from their parties in significant numbers as key Brexit votes loom in the Commons.At a Q&A session in the main hall in Brighton on Sunday, former MP Liz Lynne asked Sir Vince if all this was going to end with a new centre-ground movement led by someone like self-styled moderate Labour MP Chuka Ummuna, under a new name, and then, she added, ""the Liberal Democrats are dead"". An exasperated Sir Vince told Ms Lynne she was getting way ahead of herself. ""People are thinking of the person they hate the most and saying if they were the leader I could not possibly put up with it,"" he said.But there was no leadership contest planned in the near future, he told the audience, and if the party accepted his changes there would be robust systems to weed out unsuitable leadership candidates from outside the party.He was quite happy with the Liberal Democrat name, but if members wanted to change it that was fine too.But why not dissolve the party and form a new one, if it would help stop Brexit, which they all appear to agree is the top priority? Tom Cole, policy director of the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a second referendum and a Lib Dem member, did not rule out the idea, but could see some practical problems.""If there was a new party to be created, you would have to do it pretty quickly. Who knows how things will develop and evolve in the coming weeks and months?""I don't necessarily think you have to have one political party just focusing on that and nothing else. Questions arise about what should the party's position be on other policies. What happens if you are successful? Do you dissolve the party and go back to what it was before?""He insists People's Vote is not the forerunner of a new party as some have claimed.Ed Bird, of Waltham Forest Lib Dems said: ""The Lib Dems are not a one-issue party. It can't be just a Brexit party but there is no reason different political parties couldn't come together.""The reason anti-Brexit Labour MPs were not flocking to the Lib Dems, he argued, was because ""we are damned by the coalition with the Tories"". ""No Labour people want to get involved with us directly,"" although that is changing, he claims.""I think people are beginning to realise that we are not part of the Tory party and we are not going to jump into bed with the Tory party. We will perhaps move forward with pacts with the Labour Party, or something different, if necessary.""His friend, Bob Sullivan, is no fan of a new party but could see the Lib Dems working with other parties in Parliament to fight Brexit.""When you see (anti-Brexit Tory MP) Anna Soubry, she's brilliant. And so is Chuka. They are brilliant people within their own parties but they totally disagree with their party's stance on Brexit. ""So what would you do as a leader of the Liberal Democrats? You would be talking to them. How would you get us to come together on this issue and work together. The Liberal Democrats always like to work together with others.""Amna Ahmad, who was the Lib Dem candidate in Sutton and Cheam at last year's general election, said: ""We need to work with the current structures we have.""There were a lot of organisations, like People's Vote, trying to influence MPs over Brexit but none of them has so far stood candidates in elections, she says.""We live in a social media age, citizen power, but we still have a Parliamentary democracy and the people making the decisions are the ones there. I don't think it's about a new party that would stop Brexit. it's not as simple as that.""Caron Lindsay, of West Lothian Lib Dems, said: ""You don't actually need people to join a new party to stop Brexit. ""All you need is a majority of the MPs in the House of Commons to vote down Theresa May's deal and vote for a People's Vote. And we have been leading the arguments on that all along.""Richard Kemp, of Liverpool Walton Lib Dems, said he was happy to work with some Labour councillors but did not want to waste time ""pratting around"" with the formation of a new party.""There are 10 Labour MPs I wouldn't mind joining us. I wouldn't want more than that. We wouldn't be the Liberal Democrat party with Liberal Democrat traditions,"" he says.As for dissolving the party and starting again as a new centre-ground force, he said: ""The time for any of us to leave was during the coalition. ""I said then, and I'll say it now, you'll drag my Liberal Democrat membership card out of my cold dead hand. For Liberals who are democrats there is nowhere else for us to go."""

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.3%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-19,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180919115012/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-09-20,Tusk: May's Brexit plan won't work,https://web.archive.org//web/20180920183720/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45586010,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May's proposed new economic partnership with the EU ""will not work"", the head of the European Council has said.Donald Tusk said the plans risked undermining the EU's single market.He was speaking at the end of an EU summit in Salzburg where leaders of the 27 remaining member states discussed Brexit.Mrs May said her proposals were the ""only serious credible"" way to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.She said she had held ""frank"" talks with Mr Tusk, adding: ""Yes, concerns have been raised and I want to know what those concerns are.""There was ""a lot of hard work to be done"", she said, but added that the UK was also making preparations in case no deal could be reached.Mrs May reiterated that she would not accept the EU's ""backstop"" plan to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland, and said the UK would shortly be bringing forward its own proposals.The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and both sides are trying to reach a deal in time.There is still no agreement on some issues, including how to avoid new checks on the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland border. At a press conference, Mr Tusk said there were some ""positive elements"" in the UK's blueprint for future relations with the EU, which was agreed by ministers at Chequers in July.But, he added: ""The suggested framework for economic cooperation will not work.""Mr Tusk added that October would be the ""moment of truth"" for reaching a deal, and that ""if the conditions are there"" an additional summit would be held in November to ""formalise"" it.Can the prime minister really cling on to her Chequers plan now?The EU clearly won't accept it as it stands. Significant chunks of her party won't wear the deal either. The opposition parties won't back her.Of course there are tactics at play here. One government minister has already suggested that the EU always knows how to overplay their hand.Sometimes in negotiations, there needs to be a crisis to focus minds.And in her press conference, Theresa May seemed frustrated that her proposals perhaps have not been properly digested or considered yet.Of course this is only one day, one set of fraught meetings, in a tangled and lengthy process.But as things stand, it seems Theresa May is going to have to budge, or walk away.Read the rest of Laura's blogThe EU leaders had been discussing the UK's plans, which were presented to them by Mrs May on Wednesday evening.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said ""substantial progress"" was needed on the UK's withdrawal agreement by the next European Council meeting in October, with ""still a large piece of work"" on the separate issue of future trade relations with the UK.The 27 remaining EU members were ""united that, in the matter of the single market, there can be no compromises,"" she said.French President Emmanuel Macron said Brexit had been ""pushed by certain people who predicted easy solutions"".He added: ""Brexit has shown us one thing - and I fully respect British sovereignty in saying this - it has demonstrated that those who said you can easily do without Europe, that it will all go very well, that it is easy and there will be lots of money, are liars.""This is all the more true because they left the next day, so they didn't have to manage it.""As well the criticism from the EU, Mrs May's proposal for the UK to sign up to a common rule book for trade in goods and a combined customs territory with the EU is unpopular with many in her own party, who believe it will erode British sovereignty and is not what people voted for when they backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum.Former Brexit secretary David Davis said although EU leaders ""were trying to give some warm words"" it was now going to be ""very, very difficult"" to meet their requirements: ""So it's time for a reset, time for a rethink"".And another prominent Brexiteer, Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, said Mr Tusk's remarks signalled the end for the Chequers proposals.Please upgrade your browser""I think Chequers now has no supporters at all,"" he told the BBC.""I think the time has come for Mrs May to say 'This is not going to work'.""For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mrs May had to ""urgently drop her reckless red lines and put forward a credible plan for Brexit"".Earlier Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mrs May must delay Brexit beyond next March if there is not a detailed agreement on future trading arrangements."
2018-09-20,'Petition result is a miracle' - Paisley,https://web.archive.org//web/20180920183720/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45574495,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIan Paisley has said he is ""stunned"" and ""greatly humbled"" after retaining his seat as an MP.The North Antrim MP will not face a by-election after fewer than 10% of his constituents signed a recall petition.The petition was triggered after the DUP MP was suspended from Westminster for failing to declare two holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government.""I think it was a miracle,"" Mr Paisley told BBC News NI.The petition was the first in UK Parliamentary history.It was open for six weeks at three North Antrim constituency centres.The petition needed 7,543 signatures - or 10% of Mr Paisley's constituents - to force a by-election and cause Mr Paisley to lose his seat.It was signed by 7,099 people.Speaking in Ballymena on Thursday, Mr Paisley said the result was evidence that ""people accepted"" his apology and that he had ""put his hands up"".He said: ""90.6% said: we are keeping you, big fella, we like you.""I can't help the reasons why I am in the news....I could be a shrinking violet...I am not prepared to do that. I can't win in terms of my personality.""Mr Paisley had been suspended by the DUP ""pending further investigation into his conduct"".But on Thursday the party confirmed that it had readmitted Mr Paisley to the party on Tuesday following an internal investigation.In a statement, the DUP added: ""Upon re-admission he is subject to a number of conditions including a ban on holding office within the party for 12 months.""The party will be making no further comment on these matters."" Asked whether he expected to be re-instated by the party, the North Antrim MP said that while that decision is ""up to the party officers"", he ""would be surprised if I wasn't (brought back)"". ""I have been punished, I have been docked my salary.""Going on the holiday was not the issue - not registering it was.""In an earlier statement, he said: ""In July I apologised for a mistake made almost six years ago.""The electorate was asked to pass judgment - 90.6% have accepted my apology.""The electorate has clearly spoken.""I would like to thank my true friends, family, the electorate who have stood by me with unwavering support. Hallelujah.""On Thursday morning Mr Paisley updated his Twitter biography to say he had ""90.6% support from recall petition"".The Recall of MPs Bill became law in 2015 under the coalition government. The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, was first to be notified before the result was posted online. Sinn FÃ©in Deputy Leader Michelle O'Neill criticised the DUP's ""minor sanction"" as an effective endorsement of his actions.She said she believed the appropriate action would have been to sack Mr Paisley.Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said the result was no cause for celebration.""In any other part of the UK, Ian Paisley would have had to resign in disgrace,"" said Ms Armstrong.  SDLP Chief Whip Colin McGrath said it was ""disappointing"" and that the DUP should remove Mr Paisley from the party.""Given the heat around the ongoing RHI investigation, it is imperative Mrs Foster help restore public confidence in politics by acting swiftly to remove Mr Paisley from the party,"" he said.  Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann said he would ""caution Ian Paisley not to see this as some sort of victory or endorsement of his actions in acting as a paid advocate for a foreign government and bringing North Antrim and the House of Commons into disrepute"".He suggested that Mr Paisley ""should demonstrate some humility"".Enda McClafferty, BBC News NI Political Correspondent If the petition was to succeed then it needed the support of at least 10% of the electorate in North Antrim. It got 9.4% and was 444 signatures short. That means Ian Paisley will remain in the seat his family has held for almost 50 years. He wasn't there for the count this morning but was told the news in a text from the Chief Electoral Officer, Virginia McVea. She defended how the process was managed.Mr Paisley can now look forward to returning to the House of Commons, once he serves the remainder of his 30-day ban from Westminster.The Chief Electoral Officer in Northern Ireland, Virginia McVea, has defended how the process was managed.""The access to this electoral event is quite simply unprecedented,"" she told BBC News NI.""Never before in Northern Ireland has there been postal vote on demand, no reason had to be given, and instead of one day for poll, we ran for six weeks and with two late nights on top.""Mr Paisley's 30-sitting day suspension from the House of Commons began on 4 September, and is one of the longest-ever bans to be handed down at Westminster. According to the Commons library, it is the longest suspension since 1949, which is as far as online records go.In July, after Westminster's standards committee announced its recommendations, Mr Paisley apologised for his behaviour in the Commons."

The Labour leader said he would ""decide at the time"" what to do if Nicola Sturgeon asked for his consent.But he said his party does not want a referendum, and would be ""very clear on why we don't think it's a good idea"".Labour gave a ""cast iron guarantee"" before the last Holyrood election that it would oppose a referendum.The Scottish Conservatives claimed Mr Corbyn's comments showed that Labour is ""utterly weak when it comes to Scotland's place in the UK"".In an interview with BBC Scotland ahead of the party's conference, Mr Corbyn was asked what he would do if Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, asked for the power to hold another vote on independence. Westminster's consent would be need if any referendum was to be legally binding.Mr Corbyn replied: ""We would obviously decide at the time"", before pointing to the Â£13bn funding gap in Scotland's public finances. He said a Labour government would invest money in Scotland through a Â£20bn transformation fund and a Â£3bn increase in revenue spending. He predicted: ""Things will be very different in Scotland with an ally in Westminster like a Labour government.""When asked whether he was ruling out giving Ms Sturgeon consent for a referendum to be held, Mr Corbyn responded: ""I'm not ruling out - I'm just pointing out the reality.""We don't want another referendum, we don't think another referendum is a good idea, and we'll be very clear on why we don't think it's a good idea. ""We think what's more important is dealing with child poverty, housing problems and lack of investment in Scotland - 200,000 more children going into poverty has to be dealt with. A referendum will not solve that.""In May of last year, then-Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale said the party's Holyrood election manifesto gave a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that it would oppose a second referendum.She added: ""The Labour Party, built on solidarity and co-operation, could never support taking our country down a divisive path like that again - our country is divided enough.It came two months after Mr Corbyn said he would be ""absolutely fine"" with another independence referendum, and that Labour ""wouldn't block it"" if the Scottish Parliament voted in favour of one being held - which it has since done.His comments were heavily criticised at the time by senior Scottish Labour figures including MSP Jackie Baillie and MP Ian Murray.But Ms Sturgeon tweeted that it was ""always a pleasure to have Jeremy Corbyn campaigning in Scotland"".Responding to the Labour leader's latest remarks, Scottish Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins said: ""Every time Jeremy Corbyn talks about Scotland he gives yet another concession to the SNP.""Jeremy Corbyn does not care about Scotland and has no interest in standing up to the nationalists, as this latest gaffe proves.""BBC Scotland has launched a new podcast exploring the big political issues of the week at Holyrood and Westminster. The first episode of Podlitical is available now - with analysis of the Jeremy Corbyn interview. You can download it and subscribe wherever you get your podcasts. The Labour leader repeated his party's position that it would vote down any ""bad deal"" on Brexit, and ""certainly vote down a no deal"". But he said a failure by the government to get its final Brexit plan approved by parliament should trigger a general election rather than another referendum on EU membership.He said Labour would ""negotiate immediately with Brussels on a trade and a customs arrangement with the European Union so that we have that close relationship"" if it won the election. Mr Corbyn added: ""We've made it very clear we understand and respect the results of the referendum, but we also respect the fact that people need to keep jobs, we need to keep trade, we need to keep rights and we need to be part of the European system of human rights.""He also stressed that the 2015 Brexit referendum had ""made the decision"" that the country would leave the EU, and that ""we are not proposing another referendum"". Mr Corbyn said: ""I understand many people are (proposing one) but there are also many versions of what that referendum would be, which could actually be more complicated.""The Labour conference will open in Liverpool on Sunday, and will run until Wednesday of next week.

Sorry to pop the vanity of your own self importance Andrew but our spooks donât waste their time pumping out stories to the Mail on Sunday about someone no one has ever heard of. They are too busy trying to stop terrorism & Russian assassination attempts.   @tom_watsonEnd of Twitter post  by @BWallaceMPQuestioning how news of his ban had emerged, he referred to the ""manoeuvrings of what is now called the 'deep state'"".""Call me sceptical if you must, but I do not see journalistic enterprise behind the Mail's sudden capacity to tease obscure information out of the SBU [Ukraine's security service].""He went on: ""Someone else is doing the hard work - possibly someone being paid by the taxpayer.""I doubt if their job description is preventing the election of a Corbyn government, but who knows? We are often told that the days of secret state political chicanery are long past and we must hope so.""But sometimes you have to wonder - this curiously timed episode seems less rooted in a Kiev security scare than in a political stunt closer to home.""Mr Watson, asked about the comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said: ""I think it's highly unlikely but I don't know, I read that piece, I thought it was a bit John le Carre but I don't know where his evidence is for that.""He added: ""If he thinks the intelligence services are in some way trying to undermine the official Opposition then he should provide evidence, otherwise it's just fake news.""Security Minister Ben Wallace also dismissed Mr Murray's claims, tweeting that Britain's spies were too busy trying to prevent terrorism than ""pumping out stories to the Mail on Sunday about someone no one has ever heard of""."

Scotland's first minister told the BBC it would be ""absolutely reckless"" to leave without knowing what will replace the country's existing relationship.She urged the other opposition parties to back a delay if the UK faces a choice between ""no deal and no detail"". Prime Minister Theresa May has already said delay is ""not an option"". Negotiations over the terms of the UK's exit and future relations are at a critical stage, with about six months to go before the UK is scheduled to leave on 29 March.Mrs May spoke to her 27 EU counterparts over dinner in Salzburg on Wednesday evening, when she told them that they must focus their minds on securing a Brexit deal in the next two months.But European Council head Donald Tusk later said Mrs May's proposed new economic partnership with the EU ""will not work"".Ms Sturgeon said that any statement setting out the future relationship between the UK and the EU is increasingly likely to be ""vague and lacking in meaningful detail"" - a prospect she has described as a ""blind Brexit"".The first minister said this would mean: ""All of the difficult issues that have defied resolution in the last two years will be kicked into the transition period, but at that point the UK will already have left the EU. ""That seems to me to be tantamount to jumping off a cliff with a blindfold on and having no idea where the landing place is. And that is in my view as unacceptable as a no deal option. ""So if that's the choice that the House of Commons faces I think it is far more in the interests of the whole UK for Article 50 to be extended so that all of the alternative options can be properly considered rather than having this choice between the frying pan and the fire.""Ms Sturgeon said she could not put a timescale on how long any delay should be for, but that there would need to be ""clarity for people"" before the UK did ultimately leave. The SNP is firmly opposed to Brexit, but has not yet backed calls by the People's Vote campaign for a second referendum to be held on the issue.Please upgrade your browserMs Sturgeon said her party would not stand in the way of another vote on Brexit, and would be ""happy to have discussions"" with those advocating one. But she added: ""I think for me to become an enthusiastic advocate of that I would need some assurance that Scotland won't simply find itself in the same position all over again where Scotland votes to stay but the rest of the UK votes to leave and Scotland ends up being taken against their will.""In her speech in Salzburg, Mrs May stressed her ""serious"" proposals for future co-operation between the UK and EU would ensure a ""shared close relationship"". She also told the EU leaders that her priorities were maintaining economic ties and ensuring promises to Northern Ireland were kept.There has been speculation that the UK will put forward new ideas for regulatory checks to address the current Irish deadlock.The other EU leaders, who have warned that time is running out for a deal to be reached, will discuss Brexit without Mrs May present on Thursday.

If a material is certified as compostable, it means that under specified conditions, it will break down within 12 weeks.It is also stopping selling bottled water and using condiment sachets, as part of its efforts to eliminate all ""avoidable"" single-use plastics in both Houses by 2019, amid concerns about the scale of plastic pollution in seas and rivers. And there are plans to consider the environmental impact of packaging when it comes to procurement and tender decisions.Sir Paul Beresford, chairman of the Commons Administration Committee, said: ""I'm delighted to see significant progress being made in tackling single use avoidable plastics in Parliament... Our challenging targets reflect Parliament's commitment to leading the way in environmental sustainability.""Friends of the Earth plastics campaigner Emma Priestland said it was ""encouraging"" that Parliament was reducing its use of plastic and urged it to ""focus on sorting out the rest of the country"". ""Plant-based compostable plastics usually need to be collected separately and sent to special facilities - something many households simply don't have access to,"" she said.""If we really want to tackle the scourge of plastic pollution, ministers should focus on the phase-out of all non-essential single-use products - whatever type of plastic they are made from."" The BBC's Blue Planet II, which highlighted the damaging impact single-use plastic is having on the world's oceans, was the most-watched TV show of 2017. Scores of businesses have signed up to the UK Plastics Pact to reduce plastic pollution over the next seven years.Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042, as part of the government's 25-year plan to improve the natural environment. In June, the UN said more than 50 nations were taking action to reduce plastic pollution. India has pledged to eliminate all single-use plastic by 2022."

It was paid nearly Â£2.7m ($3.6m) by Vote Leave to target ads at prospective voters during the Brexit referendum campaign. The firm also received funding from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party and Veterans for Britain, amounting to a total of Â£3.5m from all of its pro-Brexit clients.The ICO said that although the data was gathered before 25 May, when the GDPR regulations came into effect, it was concerned about the ""continued retention and processing"" of data after that date. This, it said, meant GDPR applied to AIQ's handling of that information.Earlier this year it was linked to UK data firm Cambridge Analytica by whistleblower Chris Wylie, who alleged that Cambridge Analytica improperly acquired Facebook data belonging to 50 million people via a third party. Cambridge Analytica has been credited with helping Donald Trump win the US presidential election in 2016.Mr Wylie told the Guardian newspaper in March that staff at the now defunct Cambridge Analytica referred to AIQ as ""our Canadian office"". AIQ rejects this description and says it is 100% Canadian-owned.Following the allegations, Facebook suspended both firms from its platform. AggregateIQ denied any wrongdoing and stated that it ""works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions where we operate"".AIQ has previously denied any direct links to Cambridge Analytica. It has also denied ever employing Mr Wylie.""We appealed the enforcement notice to the first level tribunal [a legal mechanism for challenging ICO notices],"" a spokesman for AIQ told the BBC, though he declined to comment further.""It was just a matter of time before it would happen,"" said Sandra Wachter, a data regulation expert at the University of Oxford.'s Internet Institute.""The GDPR makes it very clear that if you process data within the EU obviously the laws are applicable but also if you transfer data out of the EUâ¦ or if you are targeting European markets then the GDPR is also applicable.""Meaningful data protection meant that such issues had to be considered ""globally not just locally"", she told the BBC.According to Mishcon de Reya, the ICO's notice is phrased in relatively vague terms.Dean Armstrong QC, chairman of the independent legal advisory service Elias Partnership, told the BBC he agreed with that assessment.""The ICO has given very vague instructions that are not particularly helpful,"" he said.""Perhaps the vagueness of the terminology is a deliberate ploy to ensure entities take an extremely cautious approach in changing their data-handling activities."""

""I would prefer us to work on a consistent way, to one set of standards and following one process right across Northamptonshire.  Since the joint submission by the council's for two unitaries there has been no public word from the secretary of state. The plan follows two notices banning all new spending at the county council amid a Â£70m shortfall."
2018-09-20,Labour seeks ban on betting ads during events,https://web.archive.org//web/20180920183720/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45574180,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour is calling for a ban on gambling advertising during live sporting events in a bid to tackle problem gambling. It also said it would stop people using credit cards to pay for bets and introduce a levy on gambling operators to help pay for treatment. Deputy leader Tom Watson said problem gambling was ""a public health emergency"".But the Conservatives criticised Labour for ""liberalising the gambling market when it was in power"".A report commissioned by Labour found there are 430,000 identified gambling addicts in the UK, 25,000 of which are 16 or under.Mr Watson said his party would introduce a ""whistle-to-whistle"" ban on gambling adverts being shown during a specified time before, during and after a live sporting event.He said experts who specialise in dealing with gambling addiction said those types of adverts caused a ""particular problem"". Earlier this year, the Committee of Advertising Practice and the Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice announced tougher standards on gambling advertising, including banning ads urging sports fans to ""bet now"" during events. Mr Watson told the BBC's Today programme: ""We're not anti-gambling. We just think we need to tighten up regulations because there has been a digital revolution in these new products since the last piece of legislation.""Even the industry are saying that TV advertising for in-sport betting is getting out of hand and needs dealing with."" The proposed levy would amount to 1% of operators' gross gambling yield. At present, there is a voluntary levy which Mr Watson said brought in about Â£10m a year.He said a compulsory charge would yield about Â£140m a year ""which would allow us to treat more gambling addicts when they require help with their condition"".""Gambling companies have to take more responsibility for harm caused by their products and contribute more to research and treatment."" Labour also said it would bring in new guidelines and resources to help problem gamblers. For example, it wants new rules that would enable gambling addicts to tell their bank to block online gambling transactions.Sky Bet boss Richard Flint welcomed the idea of a levy, but said banning advertising and credit card payments would not work. ""We'll study the advertising proposals carefully but think any type of blanket ban removes a key incentive for operators to get a UK gambling licence and therefore could leave UK customers more vulnerable to disreputable operators,"" he said. ""And our data on credit cards suggests that it is those customers with multiple cards that are at greater risk of harm so we believe attention should be placed on that rather than a complete ban.""Betting companies and gambling advertising have become synonymous with sporting events and sporting organisations in recent years - especially in football.This season, almost 60% of clubs in England's top two divisions have the names of gambling companies on their shirts - including nine of the 20 Premier League clubs, and 17 of the 24 in the Championship.Research also suggests that viewers of World Cup matches were exposed to 90 minutes of betting adverts during the tournament in Russia.There are also studies to show professional footballers themselves are a high-risk group, in terms of developing problematic gambling behaviour.Labour said it reiterated previous calls for Premier League clubs to volunteer to end sponsorship deals with gambling firms. But the party added it would take legislative action if clubs refused to do this on a voluntary basis.Other sports which are ""intrinsically linked"" to gambling, such as horse racing, would be exempt from the new rules.Labour's new policies stem from consultations with gambling addiction specialists, charities, industry bodies and those suffering from gambling problems. Its proposals reflect concern elsewhere about the impact of gambling advertising. In March, the Australian government banned betting ads from being shown during live sports broadcasts, and the ban was extended to include online streaming services in April.

The upgrade - which involved changes to 46% of train times - mainly affected Northern Trains in the north west of England and Govia Thameslink (GTR) routes into London.Over a period of several weeks, GTR and Northern cancelled up to 470 and 310 scheduled trains respectively each weekday.ORR chairman Prof Stephen Glaister said: ""Good intentions and over-optimism within the rail industry about its ability to recover missed deadlines left no time to uncover and fix problems. ""When problems arose, timetable planners were stretched and train operators were ill-equipped to help passengers."" Prof Glaister told the BBC ""it was unclear"" who should have the responsibility for tackling the problems.But, following a three-month inquiry, the ORR found the causes of the botched rollout dated back years.These included delays with Network Rail's electrification work in northern England, as well as late changes to the Thameslink programme.This pushed back the development of the timetable and gave train operators less time to prepare for the introduction of new services. The ORR also said that:Prof Glaister told the BBC that the ORR itself had failings - like everyone else in the industry. ""We took on trust what we were told,"" he said.""What happened here is that railway people have a tradition of sorting out problems as they occur.""That led to complacency when in the process of planning the timetables - deadlines were missed, late decisions were made so that operators didn't have time to deliver a proper service on the day.""Tom Burridge, Transport correspondentThis report underlines an inherent weakness in our rail system; No single entity or person is in overall control. The mayhem resulting from a complicated shake-up of timetables on Northern and Govia Thameslink was the product of systemic failings over several months. But as the problems built up on both Network Rail and Govia Thameslink in the run-up to the launch of the new schedules, it seems that no-one properly flagged up the risks and the potential that it all might go badly wrong. Officials from Network Rail, the Department for Transport (DfT) and the train companies were meeting.Industry sources say DfT officials were briefed that things weren't going to plan. The Transport Secretary Chris Grayling says he received the necessary assurances from the train companies. So the infamous and well-known British train blame game rolls on. Andrew Haines, the boss of Network Rail, offered his ""sincerest apologies to passengers for letting them down with May's timetable troubles"". ""A whole system approach to timetable planning must be the way ahead and we have already started on that path with the new winter timetable due in December that will see some modest improvements.""The DfT said it welcomed the ORR's findings and called May's disruption ""unacceptable"".The resignation of Charles Horton, chief executive of GTR,  was announced in June.Mr Grayling, when asked if other resignations were needed, said the report found Northern Rail's problems were linked to local infrastructure problems.Northern Rail said the report found ""that the root cause of the timetable disruption was delays to engineering projects to improve the railway"".It said train operators were usually given 40 weeks to plan the twice-yearly introduction but had to rewrite its May 2018 timetable in 16 weeks.The company added it was ""deeply sorry"" for the disruption, saying it had reinstated 151 of the 165 services hit by the problems.Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group which represents train companies and Network Rail, said the rail industry was determined to learn from the issues to avoid a repeat.He added: ""The structural issues highlighted in this report underline the need for the wide-ranging, root and branch rail review we have been calling for to deliver meaningful reform."" The government has also launched what it called the most significant review of the rail industry since privatisation, headed by former British Airways boss Keith Williams. It comes amid significant challenges, with punctuality at a 12-year low and commuters facing an increase of up to 3.2% in the cost of season tickets from January.The DfT said the review would consider all parts of the sector, including accountability, the franchising system and value for money for passengers and taxpayers.Mr Grayling told the BBC: ""The fragmentation of the industry today doesn't work"".""What I am absolutely certain of is we need an integrated railway"".He pointed to Japan where the rail companies were integrated and  London where contracts were performance-related.Labour wants to nationalise the industry but Mr Grayling told the BBC: ""It's not about ownership... it's about the pressure on the system."""
2018-09-20,Head of prisons asked to quit amid crisis,https://web.archive.org//web/20180920183720/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45584655,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe head of the prison and probation service has been asked to step down after nine years amid an ongoing crisis in English and Welsh jails.BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said Michael Spurr was prompted to resign because a ""fresh direction"" and new leadership structure was needed. Mr Spurr will leave his post in March 2019, the Ministry of Justice said.The news comes after Prisons Minister Rory Stewart admitted problems with drugs and violence in numerous jails.Last week, thousands of prison officers walked out for six hours in a protest at ""unprecedented violence"" in British prisons.Mr Stewart said that he would resign if the situation had not improved within a year.In a statement announcing the departure, Justice Secretary David Gauke said he was ""extremely grateful"" to Mr Spurr ""for his leadership of HMPPS"".He added the formal process to appoint Mr Spurr's successor will start in October.In June, MPs described the system for supervising criminals in England and Wales as a ""mess"".The Commons justice committee said HMPPS reforms had failed to meet their aims, adding it was ""unconvinced"" reforms could ever deliver an effective probation service.One month later, it was announced that private companies that run probation services would have their government contracts ended in 2020, two years earlier than planned.Many prisons in England and Wales have seen surging levels of violence, drug use and self-harm in recent years.Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, has demanded government action at four jails in less than a year, including three state-run establishments.Last week he triggered an ""urgent notification"" for HMP Bedford after an inspection found inmates had effectively taken over the violent, overcrowded and vermin-infested prison.In his annual report for 2017/18, the chief inspector highlighted how thousands of inmates are living in ""squalid"" and overcrowded cells, locked up for nearly 24 hours a day.Richard Heaton, permanent secretary at the MoJ said on Thursday it was time to ""look ahead"".Mr Heaton said the next chief executive would need to develop ""a strategy for the next decade"".Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said Mr Spurr would be ""an extraordinarily hard act to follow"".Mr Dawson added: ""He is an exceptionally principled and knowledgeable leader who has selflessly served an endless succession of short term ministers."""
2018-09-20,'Worst yet to come' in council cuts,https://web.archive.org//web/20180920183720/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-45573921,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowCouncil bosses in England say the ""worst is yet to come"" in cuts to services, as the government further reduces local authority funding.The County Council Network predicts ""unpalatable cutbacks"" next year as the councils identify at least Â£1bn savings to plug a Â£1.5bn shortfall by 2020.It also warns the risk of some councils stripping their services back to a minimum 'core offer' is growing.The government said councils will get a real term funding increase in 2018-19.It insists its approach strikes the right balance between relieving pressure on local government and ensuring taxpayers do not face excessive bills.But town hall bosses say local government funding from central government, through the revenue support grant, will have been cut by around 60% by 2020. Cllr Paul Carter, chairman of the County Council Network and leader of Kent County Council said: ""Counties will work hard to deliver the savings required, but the scope for making deliverable savings has dramatically reduced, and decisions for next year will be truly unpalatable if we are to fulfil our statutory duties. ""Without additional resource, the worst is yet to come.""Some councils have reached a financial crunch point, such as Northampton - where Â£70m of savings are required by March.Somerset has had to rubber-stamp in-year funding cuts to keep to their 2018-19 budgets, while East Sussex is drawing up a plan outlining what its core offer will be.The County Council Network, which represents 36 larger authorities, surveyed its members about their budgets and what they planned to cut next year. All 36 responded said they faced significant cost pressures, including a growth in demand in some areas - particularly children's and adult social care, inflation and rising costs outside of their control.The survey revealed council bosses had already ear-marked Â£1bn worth of services as potential sources of savings. Some Â£685m of those are to balance the books going forward.Twenty five councils who responded to a separate survey, set out what they were planning to cut, moderately or severely:Councils say they are expecting to have to switch funds from non-statutory services - the ones they are not obliged to provide by law - to ensure statutory services are provided.Councillor Nick Rushton, CCN finance spokesman and leader of Leicestershire County Council, said authorities were in a ""serious and extremely challenging financial position"" and further cuts and rising costs would make a ""bad situation even worse"". ""County councils across the country have no choice but to find a further Â£1bn of savings next year,"" he said.""There is not enough money today to run vital services. Next year there is even less from the drop in government funding.""He added that councils were again at the point where council tax rises alone would not protect services.Councillor Martin Hill, leader of Lincolnshire County Council, said his authority had to save Â£25m a year since 2010.He said it would soon come to a point where the council would have to consider whether it can operate safely with regard to its responsibilities to vulnerable children and adults.A Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government spokesman said local authorities were responsible for their own funding decisions, ""but over the next two years, we are providing councils with Â£90.7bn to help them meet the needs of their residents"".They said local councils would have the power to retain the growth in income from business rates and develop a system for the future."

""Brexit will have consequences for the Netherlands no matter what"" and ""everything must be done"" to prevent a no-deal Brexit, it quotes him as saying. The Netherlands has a greater interest in a ""decent deal"" than other EU countries, given the Dutch economy's reliance on exports, the daily says. ""Brexit is threatening our exports, our jobs, and our wallets,"" De Telegraaf quotes Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra as saying. Mr Hoekstra lists Brexit as one of the risks to Dutch economic growth, alongside geopolitical instability and trade conflicts, the daily notes. ""The Dutch government is preparing for chaos and problems"" when the UK leaves the EU, broadcaster RTL observes. Belgium's De Standaard quotes Economy Minister Kris Peeters as saying that a no-deal hard Brexit ""remains a very realistic option for now"". The paper notes that much is at stake for Belgium since 10% of its exports go to the UK, accounting for 40,000 dependent jobs.In Slovakia, Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Frantisek Ruzicka says a hard Brexit would have a ""direct impact on Slovak citizens living in the UK, trade, and services"", Teraz.sk website reports. Mr Ruzicka says Slovakia hopes the UK will be able to negotiate a political deal with the EU.  Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said at the EU summit on Brexit in Salzburg that ""we really care about ending the impasse between the UK and Europe"" and he called for stability for Polish citizens and businesses in the UK. Mr Morawiecki acknowledged that the negotiations had been nerve-racking, according to Gazeta Prawna.""In Austria, the 27 should understand that the Irish issue is the only difficulty on the way to making an agreement,"" France's Le Monde states. It notes that Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is pursuing a strategy of ""de-dramatisation"", showing a ""willingness to compromise"" on the backstop proposal for the Irish border. At the same time, European leaders are preparing to limit the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, the daily says. After all, London is pursuing ""intense lobbying to try to divide the Continental front"".Salzburg could be an ""occasion to start off on the right foot again"" after a ""summer of continued crises"" - but ""this will not be the case"", France's Le Figaro believes.  Theresa May is ""one of the few adults"" among the ""big kids of London"", Germany's centre-left Spiegel says. And this is why politicians are inclined to be friendly to her.But Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung notes that Brussels does not want to make any move before the UK Conservative Party conference. ""The fear is too great that any type of constructive proposal at Salzburg will be taken down by the Brexiteers.""  ""The passivity with which above all Angela Merkel is letting Brexit make its way bureaucratically is short-sighted,"" political editor for Die Zeit, Jochen Bittner, argues. It is precisely on the matter of sovereign borders that ""Europe could accommodate Britain with the concession that a little more control would not in any way destroy Europe's union thinking"", Bittner says. ""There are already possibilities"" for a cap on immigration within the EU, ""a kind of emergency brake"", which could be an ""insurance against that fear of overloading that made many Britons vote to leave"", he says.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

2018-09-20,Rule changes,https://web.archive.org//web/20180920183720/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45562446,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour's executive is currently meeting behind closed doors - to discuss ways of making the party more democratic.But some members are unhappy with what they see as a possible power grab by some of the big unions who control 50% of votes at next week's conference.Discussions will focus on what changes are needed to the party's rules in order to implement proposals from the year-long democracy review.The conference will then vote to approve or reject them.There is a left-wing, pro-Corbyn majority on the National Executive Committee (NEC) but some issues have proved divisive even within the left.Momentum - the group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership - has been pushing for 'open' parliamentary selections.This would allow parliamentary hopefuls to compete against any sitting MP between general elections for any Labour nomination.But some unions - also under left-wing control - believe this would diminish their role in the process of choosing MPs.So I am told a compromise is being brokered.Currently for a sitting MP to be challenged, 50% of their local party branches have to agree - and that includes not just branches consisting of individual party members, but branches  of 'affiliated' trade unions, too.In other words, those unions that pay for a link to the Labour Party such as Unite and the GMB.Under the compromise plan, a contest would be triggered if just 30% of union or party branches agree.So the existing system of selections would be reformed rather than swept away.There has, however, been a further wrangle over the compromise. The democracy review was sold as a way of empowering the membership and some on the left are fearful that it will instead further empower trade union leaders.Some local trade union branches have very few members while many of the branches consisting of fully-paid up individual party members are much larger.So a relatively small number of trade unionists could trigger a re-selection contest since it would be much easier to get 30% of trade union branches to give the sitting MP the thumbs down than 30% of the (often much larger) membership branches.There had been talk of a further compromise - giving less weight to smaller union branches.On the latest information I have, it looks like this further proposal may have been dropped.One NEC member suggested privately that the ""compromise"" - rather than either protecting sitting MPs or giving members a much greater say -  would in effect allow Unite chief Len McCluskey ""to pick off whoever he wants"".So even the ""compromise"" hasn't been agreed.Not knowingly undersold, one insider said ""it could be war"".There has also been a change to the initial proposal for selecting Jeremy Corbyn's eventual successor. What was floated at the last meeting of the NEC was a new system which would allow a candidate to get nominated with the backing of just 5% of MPs (the current threshold is 10%) so long as either 10% of local constituency parties, or 10% of unions, also nominated them.Today the NEC will discuss a new proposal - a future leader would require not only the support of 10% of MPs and local parties but would now also require the support of two trade unions that account for 5% of 'affiliated' members.Complicated as that is (and believe it or not, I have simplified the options) the upshot is that a leadership candidate wouldn't get on the ballot without the backing of some big unions.And some Momentum activists are complaining that this would skew power away from rank and file party members and are pledging to oppose it.Momentum has been pressing its members to deluge the NEC with emails calling for the leadership threshold to be reduced to 5% of MPs and for any compromise on parliamentary selections to be ditched.""Their phones are imploding under the weight of emails,"" one source said.The NEC is likely to be expanded to include, specifically, party members with disabilities and those from an ethnic minority  background. But the proposal today is that these new places will be elected equally by unions and rank-and-file members, not just by the party membership alone.After the last NEC meeting, a Corbyn-sceptic told me he had ""kicked into the long grass"" a proposal that the leaders of local authority Labour groups would be elected by the wider membership and not just by councils.Well, someone has got the political lawnmower out, because it's back on the agenda now.And local government manifestos might be drawn up not by councillors but wider local government committees which include trade union nominees.Under the current system when an NEC place chosen by the members (the unions, councillors, shadow cabinet and MPs/MEPs have their own dedicated places) becomes vacant, the runner up in the annual elections is automatically promoted onto the NEC.I understand an NEC member is considering standing down and that would mean comedian Eddie Izzard (who wasn't supported by the left) would be elevated. But under proposals to be discussed today a by-election, seen as unnecessarily expensive by opponents, would be held in future - increasing the chance of a left-wing replacementA proposal to have existing NEC members choose amongst themselves who joins them has been dropped.Clearly there are plenty of issues still to be agreed, but whatever backroom deals are done, or compromises concluded, it's likely by the end of Labour conference that it will be easier to replace sitting MPs and that it's even more likely that someone on the left (not necessarily the so-called 'hard left') will replace Jeremy Corbyn when the time comes.And that the tension between a vision of a ""members-led"" party which Momentum has been advocating, and one where the big trade unions retain power, will continue."

Here is what we learned from their annual conference...In case you were in any doubt about the Liberal Democrats' position on Brexit they have spent the last four days telling anyone who'll listen that it must be stopped. ""We are absolutely solid that we need to vote against Brexit and stop it,"" leader Sir Vince Cable said. How exactly they might do that is less clear, because, as it stands, if MPs vote against a deal reached by the government with the EU, the UK would leave with no agreement in place.  A ""People's Vote"" is needed, which Sir Vince told us could be arranged ""within weeks.""Despite announcing he would step down at some point before the next general election, Sir Vince told us he would be ""pretty busy for quite a long time"".  But he also said it was ""uncertain"" whether he would still be in the job by the end of next year. Nobody in Brighton seems to know exactly how much longer Sir Vince will be leader of the party, himself included. The conference has felt a bit like the start of a long goodbye to someone who has accepted he has a limited shelf-life. The Liberal Democrats don't do anything in a hurry. Even a Q&A session with their leader in the main conference hall was strictly moderated. Members were called upon to approach the ""intervention microphone"" and offered ""supplementary questions"". Some activists made it clear they weren't convinced about their leader's plan to give non-paying supporters a say in new policy and allow non-MPs to lead the party. ""We'll be dead,"" warned one, another said they could ""end up with someone like Chuka Umunna.""The campaigner and businesswoman was given star billing on Monday, with a speech in the main hall which members seemed to love. Surely if the party is hoping to attract new people, and allow non-MPs to lead them in future, Gina Miller would be a suitable candidate? Apparently not. She ruled herself out within the first minute of her speech to enthusiastic applause. Go figure. No, it's not a joke. Or a typo. And yes, he really was due to say that in his speech. Sir Vince Cable's proposed ""colourful metaphor"" to describe Britain's exit from the European Union dominated the pre-speech headlines.  He said he wouldn't ""deconstruct it in detail"" when asked exactly what he meant on the Today programme. The point was that the people Sir Vince describes as ""the true believers"" and ""fundamentalists"" were willing to take economic pain in return for the joy of leaving the EU.Unfortunately it didn't quite work out as planned when Sir Vince delivered his speech, with him becoming a bit tongue-tied and mangling the words:Not quite the ""erotic spasm"" phrase @vincecable https://t.co/WMy4q6UWFv #politicslive pic.twitter.com/Afup8YumrTEnd of Twitter post  by @BBCPoliticsWhat could be more fun than dancing around a hotel function room with a bunch of political activists to tracks chosen by the party's current and former MPs? I for one steered well clear of the now somewhat legendary Lib Dem disco, but apparently it was Christine Jardine who won the sound clash by playing it safe with reliable floor-fillers from ABBA, Blondie and Whitney Houston.  ""It's like a wedding,"" said one person there. If the bar was free, we might've been tempted. "
2018-09-20,Poll watching,https://web.archive.org//web/20180920183720/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45520517,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK narrowly voted in favour of Leave in the EU referendum, but with six months to go until Brexit, where does the country stand now?From whether the UK should hold another referendum, to what Brexit means for the economy, the opinion polls reveal a great deal about what the country thinks.Immediately before last year's general election, as many people thought the government was handling the negotiations well as felt it was doing so badly. But confidence fell away quickly when Theresa May lost her Commons majority. By last autumn nearly three times as many people thought the government was handling things badly (61%) as believed it was doing a good job (22%). Since the cabinet reached the Chequers agreement on how to handle the UK's future relationship with the EU, that ratio has increased further - to five to one. Leave voters have become much more critical, with only about 20% thinking the government is doing well, compared with 70% who feel it is doing badly.But voters are critical not only of the government. The polling organisation NatCen recently found 57% think the EU is handling the talks badly, while only 16% believe it is doing well.Meanwhile, polls consistently find that voters are still more likely to trust the Conservatives than Labour on the issue. Voters have also become increasingly pessimistic about how good a deal the UK will get. Until last year's general election, more people agreed than disagreed that the prime minister would secure a good deal, but thereafter, monthly polls have suggested that only about a third think the UK will get the right deal, while nearly half do not. Confidence fell yet further after the Chequers agreement. In ORB's most recent poll just 22% agreed that the prime minister will get the right deal, while 59% disagreed.Unsurprisingly, those who voted Remain have long been pessimistic. Even as long ago as September 2016, only 17% thought the UK would secure a good outcome.But doubts are now also widespread among Leave voters. According to NatCen, 40% now think the UK will get a bad deal, while just 22% reckon it will get a good one.More voters think that Brexit will be bad for the economy than believe it will be beneficial. That was also the position before the referendum. However, despite the continuing debate about the economic consequences of Brexit, the balance of opinion has shifted little. According to ICM's most recent poll, 44% of people think Brexit will be bad for the economy. That is an almost identical proportion to the 43% who held that view 18 months ago.But attitudes towards the economic consequences do seem to influence whether voters would vote the same way in another referendum.  Only about half of Leave voters who now think that Brexit will be bad for the economy would vote the same way again, a recent NatCen survey found. And only two-fifths of Remain voters who now think the economy will be better off after Brexit would vote to stay in the EU again.Immigration was a key issue for many of those who voted Leave in 2016, in part due to the EU's rules on freedom of movement.  However, some recent polling has suggested that the level of concern has declined. The proportion of people who think the rules on immigration should be the same for EU residents as those from elsewhere in the world fell from 74% in autumn 2016 to 59% now, according to NatCen.But many polls suggest voters remain more or less evenly divided over whether it is more important for the UK to end freedom of movement or stay in the EU's single market.  While most Remain supporters think it is more important to stay in the single market, most of those who voted Leave think ending freedom of movement is more important.Please upgrade your browserRead the full glossary here Before last year's general election, polls that asked people how they would vote if the referendum question was asked again often found a small majority in favour of Leave. But since then, nearly every poll has found a small majority saying that they would vote Remain. However, there is no consistent evidence suggesting that support for Remain has subsequently increased further. The UK remains more or less evenly divided on the merits of Brexit.Some polls find that those who voted Leave are a little less likely than those who backed Remain to say that they would vote the same way again.But this is not the only reason why there appears to have been a small swing to Remain since the referendum. All polls find that those who did not vote in 2016 - in some cases because they were too young to do so - are more likely to say they would vote Remain rather than Leave. So, should another referendum ever be held, the outcome might well depend on who turns out.More like thisWhether people support a second referendum depends on what they are asked.Polls that ask whether voters should have the final say on Brexit typically find more support for the idea than those that simply ask if there should be another referendum.Similarly, polls that ask whether there should be another ballot tend to find more support than those specifying the choice would be between accepting whatever deal is agreed and remaining in the EU.  The question that has been asked most often is: ""Do you think there should be a second referendum to accept or reject the terms of Britain's exit from the EU once they have been agreed?""This idea has gradually become more popular - even more so in the wake of the Chequers agreement. But there may still not be a majority in favour.Unsurprisingly perhaps, this is an issue on which Remain and Leave supporters disagree. Irrespective of how they ask about it, polls typically find that around two-thirds of Remain voters would like another ballot However, the majority - maybe as many as two-thirds - of those who backed Leave are against the idea.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.Sir John Curtice is professor of politics at Strathclyde University, senior fellow at NatCen Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.

Their leader, Sir Vince Cable, has proposed some drastic remedies - transforming the party into a ""movement for moderates"" with new supporters, and opening up the next leadership contest to ""talent"" from outside the party.Sir Vince is also talking to disgruntled Labour and Conservative MPs, who he says are ready to break away from their parties in significant numbers as key Brexit votes loom in the Commons.At a Q&A session in the main hall in Brighton on Sunday, former MP Liz Lynne asked Sir Vince if all this was going to end with a new centre-ground movement led by someone like self-styled moderate Labour MP Chuka Ummuna, under a new name, and then, she added, ""the Liberal Democrats are dead"". An exasperated Sir Vince told Ms Lynne she was getting way ahead of herself. ""People are thinking of the person they hate the most and saying if they were the leader I could not possibly put up with it,"" he said.But there was no leadership contest planned in the near future, he told the audience, and if the party accepted his changes there would be robust systems to weed out unsuitable leadership candidates from outside the party.He was quite happy with the Liberal Democrat name, but if members wanted to change it that was fine too.But why not dissolve the party and form a new one, if it would help stop Brexit, which they all appear to agree is the top priority? Tom Cole, policy director of the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a second referendum and a Lib Dem member, did not rule out the idea, but could see some practical problems.""If there was a new party to be created, you would have to do it pretty quickly. Who knows how things will develop and evolve in the coming weeks and months?""I don't necessarily think you have to have one political party just focusing on that and nothing else. Questions arise about what should the party's position be on other policies. What happens if you are successful? Do you dissolve the party and go back to what it was before?""He insists People's Vote is not the forerunner of a new party as some have claimed.Ed Bird, of Waltham Forest Lib Dems said: ""The Lib Dems are not a one-issue party. It can't be just a Brexit party but there is no reason different political parties couldn't come together.""The reason anti-Brexit Labour MPs were not flocking to the Lib Dems, he argued, was because ""we are damned by the coalition with the Tories"". ""No Labour people want to get involved with us directly,"" although that is changing, he claims.""I think people are beginning to realise that we are not part of the Tory party and we are not going to jump into bed with the Tory party. We will perhaps move forward with pacts with the Labour Party, or something different, if necessary.""His friend, Bob Sullivan, is no fan of a new party but could see the Lib Dems working with other parties in Parliament to fight Brexit.""When you see (anti-Brexit Tory MP) Anna Soubry, she's brilliant. And so is Chuka. They are brilliant people within their own parties but they totally disagree with their party's stance on Brexit. ""So what would you do as a leader of the Liberal Democrats? You would be talking to them. How would you get us to come together on this issue and work together. The Liberal Democrats always like to work together with others.""Amna Ahmad, who was the Lib Dem candidate in Sutton and Cheam at last year's general election, said: ""We need to work with the current structures we have.""There were a lot of organisations, like People's Vote, trying to influence MPs over Brexit but none of them has so far stood candidates in elections, she says.""We live in a social media age, citizen power, but we still have a Parliamentary democracy and the people making the decisions are the ones there. I don't think it's about a new party that would stop Brexit. it's not as simple as that.""Caron Lindsay, of West Lothian Lib Dems, said: ""You don't actually need people to join a new party to stop Brexit. ""All you need is a majority of the MPs in the House of Commons to vote down Theresa May's deal and vote for a People's Vote. And we have been leading the arguments on that all along.""Richard Kemp, of Liverpool Walton Lib Dems, said he was happy to work with some Labour councillors but did not want to waste time ""pratting around"" with the formation of a new party.""There are 10 Labour MPs I wouldn't mind joining us. I wouldn't want more than that. We wouldn't be the Liberal Democrat party with Liberal Democrat traditions,"" he says.As for dissolving the party and starting again as a new centre-ground force, he said: ""The time for any of us to leave was during the coalition. ""I said then, and I'll say it now, you'll drag my Liberal Democrat membership card out of my cold dead hand. For Liberals who are democrats there is nowhere else for us to go."""
2018-09-20,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180920183720/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK but talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan, which was the UK's official view of a proposed Brexit deal.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May held an awayday for the cabinet at her country residence - Chequers - in July. At this gathering a favoured UK position for Brexit talks was agreed. It included proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals and says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland.

The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-20,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180920183720/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

""I say these words as a close friend of the UK and a true admirer of PM May.""Mrs May's statement dominates many of Saturday's front pages.The Express calls her speech her ""finest hour"" and says she was right to demand respect from the EU and the Daily Mail says Mrs May ""confronted the arrogance of the EU elite with unyielding, level-headed reason"" and describes the EU's behaviour in Salzburg as ""shabby"".The Sun describes it as Mrs May's ""Brexit fightback"" while the i draws a comparison to Margaret Thatcher with a headline that reads: ""May tells EU: I'm not for turning"".But the Daily Telegraph says the prime minister is facing a showdown with her cabinet next week when ministers will call for a ""Plan B"" alternative to the Chequers proposals.Italian MEP Roberto Gualtieri, who sits on the European Parliament's Brexit Steering Group, also expressed optimism that a solution will be reached.He told BBC Newsnight: ""I think that no deal is not an option. We are sure that the rationality will prevail.""In her televised statement on Friday, Mrs May said talks had reached an ""impasse"" and could only be unblocked with ""serious engagement"" from the EU side.""Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect,"" she said. ""The UK expects the same, a good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.""At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side's proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.""The pound's fall against the dollar and the euro deepened following Mrs May's statement.Some Brexiteer MPs praised her for her comments. Jacob Rees-Mogg welcomed the ""strong and forthright"" speech but said she should abandon her Chequers plan and come forward with a Canada-style free trade agreement.Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen - who previously called for a no-confidence vote on Mrs May - said she needed to ""chuck"" the Chequers plan.""I think it could be a very, very rough ride for the prime minister when she finally realises how unpopular her Chequers proposals are, not only within the EU, but within the membership of the Conservative Party out in the constituencies,"" Mr Bridgen told BBC Newsnight. ""It' s a grim time really.In her speech on Friday, the PM said both sides were still ""a long way apart"" on two big issues: the post-Brexit economic relationship between the UK and EU, and the ""backstop"" for the Irish border, if there is a delay in implementing that relationship.Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard border - physical infrastructure like cameras or guard posts - between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic but cannot agree on how.Please upgrade your browserThe two options being offered by the EU for the long-term relationship - for the UK to stay in the European Economic Area and customs union or a basic free trade agreement - were not acceptable, Mrs May said.Mrs May says her plan for the UK and EU to share a ""common rulebook"" for goods, but not services, is the only credible way to avoid a hard border.Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's DUP, who Mrs May relies on for a Commons majority in key votes, said the prime minister was ""right to stand firm in the face of disrespectful, intransigent and disgraceful behaviour by the European Union"".Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the prime minister's negotiating strategy ""has been a disaster"" and said ""political games from both the EU and our government need to end"" to avoid a no-deal scenario. Labour wants to see the UK join a customs union with the EU after Brexit, but remain outside of the single market."
2018-09-21,Brexit: What happens next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180922065410/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45601502,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has warned that the Brexit negotiations are at an impasse and there will be no progress until the EU treats her proposals seriously.She has accused EU leaders of showing the UK a lack of respect after they rebuffed her Chequers plan without, she said, any alternative or explanation. With the clock counting down to the UK's scheduled exit on 29 March 2019, where does this latest row leave the chances of a deal and what could happen next in the Brexit process?Thursday's gathering of European leaders in Salzburg was supposed to help bridge outstanding differences and pave the way for a potential deal by the middle of November at the latest.But instead, it has driven a wedge between the UK and the EU, with accusations of bad faith and ""un-statesmanlike"" behaviour.Mrs May has said the two sides remain ""a long way"" apart on the crucial issues of how the UK will trade with the EU after Brexit and the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.She reiterated again her belief that her Chequers blueprint was the only way of properly implementing Brexit and also ensuring a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU in the future. Please upgrade your browserThe PM, visibly angered by the reception she got from her fellow leaders in Austria, also rejected the two options put on the table by the EU - a Norway-style association agreement and a much looser relationship based on Canada's trade deal with the EU. For its part, the EU has said the Chequers plan is unworkable as it fragments the single market. The next few weeks will be crucial if these differences are to be resolved and the two sides are to fulfil their shared aim of an orderly Brexit and an outline agreement on trade, security and other issues. Mrs May has suffered plenty of Brexit setbacks in the past and soldiered on and it looks like she is determined to do so again.The only problem is that many of her own MPs don't think she is going about the process of leaving the EU the right way.The number of Tories who say they won't vote for the Chequers plan seems to be growing by the day and, remember, any deal she negotiates with the EU has to get through Parliament.There is enormous pressure from the Brexiteer-wing of the party for her to rip up Chequers and throw her weight behind a turbo-charged version of Canada's deal with the EU.The so-called Canada Plus Plus option, which removes most customs duties on goods but no single market access, is backed by Boris Johnson, David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg, among others, who believe the UK Parliament will vote for it.Many Conservative Remainers, like former minister Justine Greening, have also lost faith in Chequers and think there should be a referendum (more of that later) while some Tories think the UK may well end up in a temporary European Economic Area-style arrangement, sometimes called the Norway option. This would mean accepting the free movement of people and the indirect recognition of European Court of Justice rulings - but would allow businesses access to the EU single market, with some strings attached.Amid speculation about further cabinet resignations if she persists with Chequers, calls for the PM to think again are likely to reach a crescendo at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham.If the PM does not shift on the substance of her Chequers plan, expect much frenzied talk of leadership challenges.Salzburg may have caused a dust-up but it hasn't changed the underlying reality that both sides want as amicable a divorce as possible.Some Tory MPs favour a clean break with the EU, which would see the UK fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization, the global body governing international trade, but they are in a minority.Both sides are ramping up talk of no-deal contingency planning.But they also know that such an outcome would be seen as a political failure and a disaster for business - particularly as the 21-month transition period planned after Brexit day would be scrapped.A summit on 18-19 October of EU leaders was, for a long time, pencilled in as the moment that the two sides would have to look each other in the eye and reach a deal.However, this is not now seen as feasible and the focus is on a special one-off summit that has been arranged for mid-November.An agreement then, the thinking goes, would still allow enough time for the UK and European Parliaments and a supermajority of European states - that's 20 out of 27 - to ratify any deal before the 29 March deadline.So, the clock is ticking but the EU is renowned for finalising deals at the 11th hour and it wouldn't be the first time the talks have seemed on the brink of collapse only for a deal to be pulled out of the fire. If she brings a deal back from Brussels, Theresa May has another big hurdle to negotiate. She must persuade Parliament to back it, in a vote likely before the end of the year or in early 2019.Tory Brexiteers opposed to Chequers have suggested up to 80 MPs would be prepared to vote against it. Although we don't know what the final deal will look like and the size of any rebellion would, in all likelihood, be much smaller, even a dozen Conservatives defying the leadership would risk defeat for the PM, with her non-existent Commons majority.The opposition parties are unlikely to come to the PM's aid, with Labour saying any deal is unlikely to pass its six tests guaranteeing workers' rights and all the ""benefits"" of the single market and customs union.The Labour leadership is hoping to inflict a defeat as a way of triggering a general election.It is written into law that the UK will be leaving at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019, two years to the day after the government notified the EU of its intention to quit, by triggering Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty. But if there is no deal or Parliament rejects the deal, we are in uncharted territory and it is impossible to say with any certainty what will happen next.Mrs May has insisted the 2016 referendum result will not be overturned but if Parliament cannot agree on what kind of Brexit it wants, a fresh public vote might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. There are a growing number of people who believe this is the case, although they are largely confined to people who voted Remain in 2016 and they can't all agree on what question should be asked on the ballot paper.The cross-party People's Vote campaign, backed by about 30 Labour MPs, five Conservatives, the four Plaid Cymru MPs and Green MP Caroline Lucas, wants the option to stay in the EU to be put before voters.Critics say there won't be enough time for another referendum - and Mrs May has explicitly ruled out extending the two-year Article 50 process, amid reports EU leaders might be open to that.However, and it is a big however, should Mrs May resign in the event of her deal being rejected, her successor would have a new mandate. Some European leaders believe Brexit can be halted but, in the absence of a referendum, the only other way this could conceivably happen is if there were a general election before 29 March next year. A new government with a majority would have the power to delay or reverse the process but whether it would have the desire - given Labour's policy so far has been to respect the Brexit vote - is another matter entirely.If the UK does leave as planned, it is far from the end of the story. It is only then that discussions about future co-operation - including a trade deal - will really begin in earnest. "
2018-09-21,Labour 'could nationalise rail in five years',https://web.archive.org//web/20180922065410/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45609604,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe rail industry could be completely renationalised within five years if Labour wins the next election, the shadow chancellor has suggested.John McDonnell said he was looking at whether break clauses in contracts could allow rail franchises to be taken into public hands before they expired.He is planning to create a new unit in the Treasury to oversee the party's wider nationalisation plans.It would advise on issues such as possible compensation for shareholders.Mr McDonnell was asked about the party's nationalisation plans in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme ahead of Labour's annual conference in Liverpool.The party's 2017 manifesto included a pledge to bring private rail companies back into public ownership as their franchises expired.However, some franchises are set to continue for many years and the party has said it could use break clauses in contracts to take control sooner. There are currently 18 franchises in England, Scotland and Wales.With the odd exception, the shortest contracts run for seven years, although 10 years is more common.Northern Ireland's rail system has remained nationalised since 1948.The train operating companies are not responsible for track maintenance, which falls to publicly owned Network Rail.Asked whether it was possible all the franchises could be in public hands in the first term of a Labour government Mr McDonnell added: ""I think that's possible. That's why we're working through the detail now of how that can be done. ""And if you look at what's happened over time a number of these franchises have been handed back anyway.""His broader plan is for Labour to establish a Public Ownership Unit to develop legal and financial plans to bring private industries into the state sector, and set out a timetable for action.It would advise on how much compensation shareholders would receive and help decide which Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs) should be nationalised.Labour is keen to present itself as ready for office in the event of an early general election.Mr McDonnell said: ""We will have new structures of government. ""I'll be ready on day one going into government to be able to bring forward the legislation, to implement the policy.""Mr McDonnell argued his plans were cost neutral because the cash generated by newly acquired private companies would cover the cost of financing the debt needed to buy them. There would be enough money left over, he said, to increase investment and reduce consumers' bills.But he declined to say how much extra borrowing would be required to purchase private assets.Shareholders in private companies would receive bonds - government debt - in return for their shares. The new Treasury unit would advise what level of compensation they were due, with the final decision made by Parliament.PFI is a way of financing investment in public infrastructure using private capital. Private firms stump up the cost of building facilities - such as a hospital or school - and, in return, the state makes payments over a period of time - often about 25 years - for their use and management.The model has been attractive to governments of all political persuasions as it limits upfront capital expenditure and reduces risk while future payment obligations do not count towards the national debt. However, its value for money has long been questioned. As of March 2016 there were 716 PFI projects, 686 of which were still operational. The others had either been cancelled or had reached the end of the contract period.The SNP government stopped new PFI contracts when it came to power in Scotland, replacing them with NPDs (non-profit distributing projects).Labour intends to take control of PFIs by nationalising Special Purpose Vehicles - the companies established to run them. Typically, investors would be compensated and Labour would follow legal advice, Mr McDonnell said.But he added: ""There might be some factors in relation to some operations of PFIs in particular that could be brought forward that says actually there is no compensatory arrangements needed here.""The party's annual conference - staged under the slogan ""Rebuilding Britain, for the many, not the few"" - is due to begin in Liverpool on Sunday, with the party pledging to ""put equality centre stage"".It will close on Wednesday with a major speech by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is coming under pressure to back a referendum on the final Brexit deal - he has so far insisted he wants to see a general election instead.Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) is due to meet later on Saturday, the day before the main conference begins, to discuss changes to leadership election rules."

Shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler unveiled the policy at the party's Women's Conference in Liverpool.The proposals aim to give victims time to leave abusive partners safely and seek support. Ms Butler said the policy would save lives and tackle the ""hidden killer"" of domestic abuse. Speaking ahead of the launch of Labour's annual conference on Sunday, Ms Butler told the conference employers had a ""duty of care"" to employees experiencing domestic abuse.""This crucial time will allow women and men to leave their abusive partners safely - get the help, protection and support they need knowing their livelihood is secure.""On average two women a week are murdered by their current or former abusive partner. These 10 days could literally help save the lives of those women.""Similar laws have already been introduced in the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand, she added.Ms Butler also announced plans to set up a new department for Women and Equalities, as part of Labour's pledge to ""put equality centre stage"".""So far we have seen seven different ministers for equality tagged on to four different departments and a budget that's nearly been halved,"" she told the conference. ""This proves the Tories are not taking equalities seriously. By establishing a Department for Women and Equalities, Labour will ensure equalities is the common thread running through its government""The annual Labour conference - staged under the slogan ""Rebuilding Britain, for the many, not the few"" - will start on Sunday, and close on Wednesday with a major speech by Mr Corbyn.The stage is set for fierce debates about Brexit and the future of the party at the Liverpool gathering. Lively debates -yes even divisions - are expected at this year's gathering. Labour's NEC meets tonight to hammer out new leadership rules that are likely to see the influence of MPs watered down in favour of more say for members and the unions. And tomorrow behind the scenes there will be wrangles over how to boil down 125 Brexit motions to just two or three - with some members wanting to push the leadership further than it wants to go in calling for a new referendum on the EU.But it's often the unanticipated divisions that can cause the bigger problem. Dawn Butler not only praised the 1980s Militant-led Liverpool council in her speech to the women's conference today - but she also suggested it was better to break the law than break the poor. Some in the party are furious that she has gifted the Conservatives a weapon of attack. Party policy is for councillors to set legal budgets - but Labour's opponents can now question its sincerity. "

The party's interim manifesto includes sections on free speech, political correctness and Islamic extremism, as well as the NHS, defence, education and policing among others.It urges a ""complete and total withdrawal from the European Union"", and says UKIP will keep fighting to make the UK an ""independent, self-governing, sovereign state"", regardless of any Brexit deal reached. In it, Mr Batten says UKIP will ""promote and defend our national and individual freedoms"" adding: ""We are determined to protect our freedom of speech and the right to speak our minds without fear of the politically correct thought-police knocking on our doors.""The manifesto covers a wide range of policy areas, from the NHS and transport to fisheries and small businesses, with policies including: Mr Batten, who took over as leader in February but has said he intends to resign after a year, said: ""These policies are aimed at helping the people who form the backbone of Britain: ordinary workers and taxpayers, the unemployed who would like to work, and small and medium-sized business owners.""""Its purpose is to make UKIP a populist party in the real meaning of the word - one whose policies are popular with voters.""The UKIP leader has hit back at claims of growing links between the party and far-right groups, telling Sky News he was ""entitled to speak at rallies organised by people who believe in democracy"". Mr Batten said Tommy Robinson would not be admitted to UKIP ""in the near future"" because it would require changes to the party's rules.But Mr Farage, who has returned to the domestic political fray with a campaign to ""save Brexit"", said UKIP risked ""total and utter marginalisation"" unless it changed direction.He told the Press Association he was ""totally opposed"" to allowing Mr Robinson into the party. ""I wrote very explicitly into the rules of the party when I first became leader: we did not want anybody in the party that had taints with organisations we deemed to be on the far right of British politics,"" he said.""It really upsets me to see the fact this debate is even taking place.""UKIP, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, saw its popularity collapse in the 2017 election after securing only 594,068 votes - down from 3,881,099 in 2015.The party leadership has changed hands six times since the 2016 EU referendum, with Mr Farage returning temporarily when his successor Diane James quit after less than a month at the helm. Paul Nuttall succeeded her in November 2016 but quit following the 2017 general election - and Steve Crowther became acting leader. Henry Bolton was elected leader in September 2017 but was ousted following controversy over racist messages sent by his partner. "

The cross-party group of politicians argue that Article 50 can be revoked if MPs vote to do so.The Court of Session in Edinburgh had previously rejected their bid to have the case referred to European judges. But they have now won an appeal, and the European Court of Justice will be asked to give a definitive ruling.The panel of appeal judges at the Court of Session said the ""urgency of the issue"" - with the UK due to leave the EU on 29 March - meant its request to the European Court was being done under expedited procedure.The UK government said it was ""disappointed"" by the decision and was giving it ""careful consideration"". But a spokesman stressed that the government remained committed to implementing the result of the EU referendum and ""will not be revoking Article 50.""The legal case has been brought by politicians including Scottish Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, Labour MEPs David Martin and Catherine Stihler and SNP MEP Alyn Smith, who have claimed that Brexit is ""not inevitable"" and ""there is still time to change course"". Welcoming the ruling, Mr Greer said: ""If negotiations collapse, as appears to be happening, we have to know that a no deal disaster is not the only option on the table.""The politicians have been joined by lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, the director of the Good Law Project, who said the latest ruling was a ""bombshell"" that could ""decide the fate of the nation"" and potentially allow the country to ""wake up from the nightmare that is this government's Brexit"".BIG ð´ó §ó ¢ó ³ó £ó ´ó ¿ðªðºNEWS!

Brexit is not inevitable, there is still time to change course. https://t.co/qhAL4wPDdrEnd of Twitter post  by @AlynSmithPrime Minister Theresa May has admitted that negotiations with the EU have reached an ""impasse"" after her Brexit plans were rejected at a summit in Salzburg earlier this week. But in a speech outside Downing Street she insisted that: ""Nobody wants a good deal more than me - but I will not overturn the result of the referendum, nor will I break up my country.""The speech was described as ""dreadful"" by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who claimed Mrs May's so-called Chequers proposals for Brexit were now a ""dead duck"" and that Brexit ""should not happen"" if the PM was not going to keep the country in the single market and customs union.The petitioners argue that the UK should now effectively be allowed to change its mind on Brexit, without needing the permission of the other 27 EU members.If it is successful, their case could strengthen the hand of any attempt by MPs to keep the UK in the EU after the final details of its departure terms are known. This is because it would give parliament the power to unilaterally halt Brexit if it feels any final deal - or no deal - is unacceptable, even if the government wants to leave regardless.Court of Session judge Lord Boyd ruled in June that the case could not go to the European Court in Luxembourg as it was ""hypothetical"" and did not reflect political reality as it ""seems highly unlikely that this government will revoke the notification"".The campaigners appealed against that decision, and on Friday the court ruled in their favour.The ruling was delivered by Scotland's most senior judge, Lord Carloway, and his colleagues Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond Young.The appeal judges said matters had ""moved on"" since Lord Boyd's original ruling, with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act now setting out how parliamentary approval is to be sought once the negotiations between the UK government and the EU conclude. Lord Carloway said it was therefore ""clear"" that MPs at Westminster would be required to vote on any Brexit deal agreed by the EU and the UK government.He stated: ""It seems neither academic nor premature to ask whether it is legally competent to revoke the notification and thus to remain in the EU. ""The matter is uncertain in that it is the subject of a dispute; as this litigation perhaps demonstrates.""The answer will have the effect of clarifying the options open to MPs in the lead up to what is now an inevitable vote.""The judge also said the European court would not be advising parliament on ""what it must or ought to do"".Instead, he said it would be ""merely declaring the law as part of its central function"", adding that ""how parliament chooses to react to that declarator is entirely a matter for that institution"".In their draft reference to the European Court, the judges ask: ""Where a member state has notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the European Union, does EU law permit that notice to be revoked unilaterally by the notifying member state?""And, if so, subject to what conditions and with what effect relative to the member state remaining within the EU?"""

The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned that the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal was a big concern for firms. ""Many firms are hugely worried about a messy and disorderly outcome, and the potential impact on their ability to trade and grow. Others could be caught flat-footed. Both sides must make every effort to avoid this scenario,"" said BCC director general Adam Marshall.Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, said negotiators on both sides had to change tack.""The stakes could not be higher. Jobs, wages and living standards are at risk, on both sides of the Channel. ""With time slipping away, employers and employees alike need to see constructive dialogue. Pragmatism must come before politics. Every day lost in rhetoric is lost investment and lost jobs,"" she added. Mrs May's statement followed a cool reception for her Chequers plan at a summit of EU leaders in Salzburg.She said the two sides were still ""a long way apart"" on the post-Brexit economic relationship.The two options being offered by the EU - for the UK to stay in the European Economic Area and customs union or a basic free trade agreement - were not acceptable, she said.She said EU leaders needed to come up with new alternatives to her Brexit proposals if both sides were to break the current deadlock.""It is not acceptable to simply reject the other side's proposals without a detailed explanation and counter-proposals,"" Mrs May said.

It is understood that key witnesses including Mr Yousaf were not contacted during the internal Labour investigation as Mr Dempster, a Dumfries and Galloway councillor, admitted making the remark.Mr Corbyn told BBC Scotland: ""What I would make clear is that first of all as a party we don't tolerate racism in any form, I as party leader do not tolerate racism in any form. ""It is all investigated as quickly as it can be investigated and appropriate action is taken - there's a range of actions that can be taken by our national executive.""He added: ""The issues that face us all are the need to be united and not allow racism to fester any more than we would allow the far-right to rise anywhere across this country.""A Scottish Labour spokesman insisted that the party takes any allegations of racism ""extremely seriously"".He added: ""All complaints about Islamophobia are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.""But a party source told BBC Scotland that it ""needs to take a look at why the disciplinary process takes so long, because it isn't fair for victims.""The party can't just talk about having a zero tolerance approach to racism, it must practice it as well.""But Mr Yousaf hit out on Twitter, saying six months had now passed since Mr Dempster was suspended from Labour after he ""admitted Islamophobia"".The justice secretary said: ""He should have been expelled. What have Labour done in six months? Zero, zilch, nada.""Let's call Corbyn out - he is utterly duplicitous when it comes to tackling racism in his own party.""He says many warm words then fails miserably to follow it up with any action. He is a hypocrite and has been exposed as one time and time again.""Allegations first emerged in March that Mr Dempster had made the comments about Mr Yousaf in a meeting with officials from Transport Scotland.He is said to have told them no-one would have noticed Mr Yousaf because no-one would have seen him under his burka. He was suspended by the party and subsequently apologised to Mr Yousaf, saying he was ashamed and embarrassed and could offer no defence or explanation."
2018-09-21,Poll watchdog seeks Brexit ruling appeal,https://web.archive.org//web/20180922065410/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45601435,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Electoral Commission is seeking leave to appeal against a High Court ruling on spending by Vote Leave in the run-up to the EU referendum.The election watchdog was judged earlier this month to have ""misinterpreted"" the legal definition of referendum expenses.The judicial review was brought by campaign group The Good Law Project.The group said the Electoral Commission had failed in its duty to regulate the referendum process.An Electoral Commission spokesman said: ""Today we are applying to the High Court for permission to appeal a judgement made last week which ruled on the interpretation of a point of law on campaign donations and expenditure.""We are considering the implications of this judgement, including how it could impact on candidates, parties and non-party campaigners across all types of elections or referendums.""The law must be as clear as possible in order to enable campaigners to fully and fairly participate in the democratic process.""Should we obtain leave to appeal, this will inform any decision we make on whether to lodge an appeal against the judgement.""Mr Justice Leggatt, who heard the case with Mr Justice Green, said Vote Leave paid Â£620,000 to Canadian digital agency AggregateIQ at the request of another leave campaigner, Darren Grimes, in the days before the referendum.This put Vote Leave over its Â£7m election spending limit by almost Â£500,000.The Electoral Commission initially said there were ""no reasonable grounds to suspect"" the law on reporting expenses had been broken.It changed its mind after the Good Law Project launched its case in October last year, starting an investigation into the spending of Vote Leave and Mr Grimes.The watchdog concluded in July that both had incorrectly reported their spending.Vote Leave was fined Â£61,000 and Mr Grimes was handed a Â£20,000 fine by the commission, which referred the matter to the Metropolitan Police.Vote Leave says it was given incorrect advice by the Electoral Commission about the legality of funnelling money through Mr Grimes's group BeLeave, during the referendum campaign.It has called on the watchdog to withdraw its fines or appeal against the High Court ruling.The Good Law Project says the High Court ruling showed the watchdog had ""unlawfully tilted the playing field in favour of Leave"".The Electoral Commission has said the High Court ruling was not about the advice it gave to Vote Leave.""Our advice was generic and covered hypothetical scenarios,"" said the commission's chief executive Claire Bassett, following the ruling.""At no point did we give any advice or discuss payments to Aggregate IQ.""Mr Justice Leggatt said there would be a further hearing to determine what orders the court should make as a result of its ruling.

2018-09-21,'Petition result is a miracle' - Paisley,https://web.archive.org//web/20180922065410/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45574495,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIan Paisley has said he is ""stunned"" and ""greatly humbled"" after retaining his seat as an MP.The North Antrim MP will not face a by-election after fewer than 10% of his constituents signed a recall petition.The petition was triggered after the DUP MP was suspended from Westminster for failing to declare two holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government.""I think it was a miracle,"" Mr Paisley told BBC News NI.The petition was the first in UK Parliamentary history.It was open for six weeks at three North Antrim constituency centres.The petition needed 7,543 signatures - or 10% of Mr Paisley's constituents - to force a by-election and cause Mr Paisley to lose his seat.It was signed by 7,099 people.Speaking in Ballymena on Thursday, Mr Paisley said the result was evidence that ""people accepted"" his apology and that he had ""put his hands up"".He said: ""90.6% said: we are keeping you, big fella, we like you.""I can't help the reasons why I am in the news....I could be a shrinking violet...I am not prepared to do that. I can't win in terms of my personality.""Mr Paisley had been suspended by the DUP ""pending further investigation into his conduct"".But on Thursday the party confirmed that it had readmitted Mr Paisley to the party on Tuesday following an internal investigation.In a statement, the DUP added: ""Upon re-admission he is subject to a number of conditions including a ban on holding office within the party for 12 months.""The party will be making no further comment on these matters."" Asked whether he expected to be re-instated by the party, the North Antrim MP said that while that decision is ""up to the party officers"", he ""would be surprised if I wasn't (brought back)"". ""I have been punished, I have been docked my salary.""Going on the holiday was not the issue - not registering it was.""In an earlier statement, he said: ""In July I apologised for a mistake made almost six years ago.""The electorate was asked to pass judgment - 90.6% have accepted my apology.""The electorate has clearly spoken.""I would like to thank my true friends, family, the electorate who have stood by me with unwavering support. Hallelujah.""On Thursday morning Mr Paisley updated his Twitter biography to say he had ""90.6% support from recall petition"".The Recall of MPs Bill became law in 2015 under the coalition government. The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, was first to be notified before the result was posted online. Sinn FÃ©in Deputy Leader Michelle O'Neill criticised the DUP's ""minor sanction"" as an effective endorsement of his actions.She said she believed the appropriate action would have been to sack Mr Paisley.Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said the result was no cause for celebration.""In any other part of the UK, Ian Paisley would have had to resign in disgrace,"" said Ms Armstrong.  SDLP Chief Whip Colin McGrath said it was ""disappointing"" and that the DUP should remove Mr Paisley from the party.""Given the heat around the ongoing RHI investigation, it is imperative Mrs Foster help restore public confidence in politics by acting swiftly to remove Mr Paisley from the party,"" he said.  Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann said he would ""caution Ian Paisley not to see this as some sort of victory or endorsement of his actions in acting as a paid advocate for a foreign government and bringing North Antrim and the House of Commons into disrepute"".He suggested that Mr Paisley ""should demonstrate some humility"".Enda McClafferty, BBC News NI Political Correspondent If the petition was to succeed then it needed the support of at least 10% of the electorate in North Antrim. It got 9.4% and was 444 signatures short. That means Ian Paisley will remain in the seat his family has held for almost 50 years. He wasn't there for the count this morning but was told the news in a text from the Chief Electoral Officer, Virginia McVea. She defended how the process was managed.Mr Paisley can now look forward to returning to the House of Commons, once he serves the remainder of his 30-day ban from Westminster.The Chief Electoral Officer in Northern Ireland, Virginia McVea, has defended how the process was managed.""The access to this electoral event is quite simply unprecedented,"" she told BBC News NI.""Never before in Northern Ireland has there been postal vote on demand, no reason had to be given, and instead of one day for poll, we ran for six weeks and with two late nights on top.""Mr Paisley's 30-sitting day suspension from the House of Commons began on 4 September, and is one of the longest-ever bans to be handed down at Westminster. According to the Commons library, it is the longest suspension since 1949, which is as far as online records go.In July, after Westminster's standards committee announced its recommendations, Mr Paisley apologised for his behaviour in the Commons."

""Brexit will have consequences for the Netherlands no matter what"" and ""everything must be done"" to prevent a no-deal Brexit, it quotes him as saying. The Netherlands has a greater interest in a ""decent deal"" than other EU countries, given the Dutch economy's reliance on exports, the daily says. ""Brexit is threatening our exports, our jobs, and our wallets,"" De Telegraaf quotes Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra as saying. Mr Hoekstra lists Brexit as one of the risks to Dutch economic growth, alongside geopolitical instability and trade conflicts, the daily notes. ""The Dutch government is preparing for chaos and problems"" when the UK leaves the EU, broadcaster RTL observes. Belgium's De Standaard quotes Economy Minister Kris Peeters as saying that a no-deal hard Brexit ""remains a very realistic option for now"". The paper notes that much is at stake for Belgium since 10% of its exports go to the UK, accounting for 40,000 dependent jobs.In Slovakia, Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Frantisek Ruzicka says a hard Brexit would have a ""direct impact on Slovak citizens living in the UK, trade, and services"", Teraz.sk website reports. Mr Ruzicka says Slovakia hopes the UK will be able to negotiate a political deal with the EU.  Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said at the EU summit on Brexit in Salzburg that ""we really care about ending the impasse between the UK and Europe"" and he called for stability for Polish citizens and businesses in the UK. Mr Morawiecki acknowledged that the negotiations had been nerve-racking, according to Gazeta Prawna.""In Austria, the 27 should understand that the Irish issue is the only difficulty on the way to making an agreement,"" France's Le Monde states. It notes that Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is pursuing a strategy of ""de-dramatisation"", showing a ""willingness to compromise"" on the backstop proposal for the Irish border. At the same time, European leaders are preparing to limit the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, the daily says. After all, London is pursuing ""intense lobbying to try to divide the Continental front"".Salzburg could be an ""occasion to start off on the right foot again"" after a ""summer of continued crises"" - but ""this will not be the case"", France's Le Figaro believes.  Theresa May is ""one of the few adults"" among the ""big kids of London"", Germany's centre-left Spiegel says. And this is why politicians are inclined to be friendly to her.But Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung notes that Brussels does not want to make any move before the UK Conservative Party conference. ""The fear is too great that any type of constructive proposal at Salzburg will be taken down by the Brexiteers.""  ""The passivity with which above all Angela Merkel is letting Brexit make its way bureaucratically is short-sighted,"" political editor for Die Zeit, Jochen Bittner, argues. It is precisely on the matter of sovereign borders that ""Europe could accommodate Britain with the concession that a little more control would not in any way destroy Europe's union thinking"", Bittner says. ""There are already possibilities"" for a cap on immigration within the EU, ""a kind of emergency brake"", which could be an ""insurance against that fear of overloading that made many Britons vote to leave"", he says.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

2018-09-21,Rule changes,https://web.archive.org//web/20180922065410/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45562446,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour's executive is currently meeting behind closed doors - to discuss ways of making the party more democratic.But some members are unhappy with what they see as a possible power grab by some of the big unions who control 50% of votes at next week's conference.Discussions will focus on what changes are needed to the party's rules in order to implement proposals from the year-long democracy review.The conference will then vote to approve or reject them.There is a left-wing, pro-Corbyn majority on the National Executive Committee (NEC) but some issues have proved divisive even within the left.Momentum - the group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership - has been pushing for 'open' parliamentary selections.This would allow parliamentary hopefuls to compete against any sitting MP between general elections for any Labour nomination.But some unions - also under left-wing control - believe this would diminish their role in the process of choosing MPs.So I am told a compromise is being brokered.Currently for a sitting MP to be challenged, 50% of their local party branches have to agree - and that includes not just branches consisting of individual party members, but branches  of 'affiliated' trade unions, too.In other words, those unions that pay for a link to the Labour Party such as Unite and the GMB.Under the compromise plan, a contest would be triggered if just 30% of union or party branches agree.So the existing system of selections would be reformed rather than swept away.There has, however, been a further wrangle over the compromise. The democracy review was sold as a way of empowering the membership and some on the left are fearful that it will instead further empower trade union leaders.Some local trade union branches have very few members while many of the branches consisting of fully-paid up individual party members are much larger.So a relatively small number of trade unionists could trigger a re-selection contest since it would be much easier to get 30% of trade union branches to give the sitting MP the thumbs down than 30% of the (often much larger) membership branches.There had been talk of a further compromise - giving less weight to smaller union branches.On the latest information I have, it looks like this further proposal may have been dropped.One NEC member suggested privately that the ""compromise"" - rather than either protecting sitting MPs or giving members a much greater say -  would in effect allow Unite chief Len McCluskey ""to pick off whoever he wants"".So even the ""compromise"" hasn't been agreed.Not knowingly undersold, one insider said ""it could be war"".There has also been a change to the initial proposal for selecting Jeremy Corbyn's eventual successor. What was floated at the last meeting of the NEC was a new system which would allow a candidate to get nominated with the backing of just 5% of MPs (the current threshold is 10%) so long as either 10% of local constituency parties, or 10% of unions, also nominated them.Today the NEC will discuss a new proposal - a future leader would require not only the support of 10% of MPs and local parties but would now also require the support of two trade unions that account for 5% of 'affiliated' members.Complicated as that is (and believe it or not, I have simplified the options) the upshot is that a leadership candidate wouldn't get on the ballot without the backing of some big unions.And some Momentum activists are complaining that this would skew power away from rank and file party members and are pledging to oppose it.Momentum has been pressing its members to deluge the NEC with emails calling for the leadership threshold to be reduced to 5% of MPs and for any compromise on parliamentary selections to be ditched.""Their phones are imploding under the weight of emails,"" one source said.The NEC is likely to be expanded to include, specifically, party members with disabilities and those from an ethnic minority  background. But the proposal today is that these new places will be elected equally by unions and rank-and-file members, not just by the party membership alone.After the last NEC meeting, a Corbyn-sceptic told me he had ""kicked into the long grass"" a proposal that the leaders of local authority Labour groups would be elected by the wider membership and not just by councils.Well, someone has got the political lawnmower out, because it's back on the agenda now.And local government manifestos might be drawn up not by councillors but wider local government committees which include trade union nominees.Under the current system when an NEC place chosen by the members (the unions, councillors, shadow cabinet and MPs/MEPs have their own dedicated places) becomes vacant, the runner up in the annual elections is automatically promoted onto the NEC.I understand an NEC member is considering standing down and that would mean comedian Eddie Izzard (who wasn't supported by the left) would be elevated. But under proposals to be discussed today a by-election, seen as unnecessarily expensive by opponents, would be held in future - increasing the chance of a left-wing replacementA proposal to have existing NEC members choose amongst themselves who joins them has been dropped.Clearly there are plenty of issues still to be agreed, but whatever backroom deals are done, or compromises concluded, it's likely by the end of Labour conference that it will be easier to replace sitting MPs and that it's even more likely that someone on the left (not necessarily the so-called 'hard left') will replace Jeremy Corbyn when the time comes.And that the tension between a vision of a ""members-led"" party which Momentum has been advocating, and one where the big trade unions retain power, will continue."
2018-09-21,Reality check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180922065410/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45589275,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe locals call it the Holyhead hum: it's the sound of refrigeration units attached to lorry trailers waiting, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for the next ferry bound for Dublin. This small town on Anglesey lies at the heart of one of the poorest areas in the UK. But it is also the second busiest roll-on roll-off ferry port in the country, a vital link in a seamless supply chain for businesses across the UK and Ireland. Brexit, for which Anglesey narrowly voted in the 2016 referendum, could change everything. Why? Because at the moment this is the quickest route across the Irish Sea - the sailing time from Dublin to Holyhead is just over three hours. ""At night-time,"" says Ian Davies, trade director for Stena Line, which runs Holyhead Port, ""we have 400 to 500 articulated lorries coming off two ferries within 25 minutes of each other."" If you put those lorries back-to-back, they would form a queue three miles (4.8km) long.""We've got to keep moving,"" Mr Davies says. ""We don't have the standing room to put five kilometres of freight.""In other words, any customs or regulatory checks, which could cause delays after Brexit, would be difficult to swallow. ""It seems likely that there will be some extra checks,"" says Andrew Potter, a logistics expert at Cardiff Business School, ""and planning is taking place. But without clarity about what will happen, it's difficult to know how the port will reorganise itself.""The Irish connection is even more complicated because roughly a third of the freight arriving in Holyhead from Dublin originates in Northern Ireland. That's partly because sailing times from Belfast to Liverpool are more like eight hours. It means a lot of freight from the North crosses the open Irish border by road, and still arrives in Britain more quickly.Take chicken, for example. Producers in Northern Ireland transport their meat to Dublin, and send it via Holyhead to big warehouses in the Midlands for distribution around the country.  Some of that chicken even gets sent back to supermarkets in Ireland and Northern Ireland - a reminder that the UK and Ireland really do operate at the moment as one economic space. And everyone in the supply chain, including consumers, benefits. ""A lot of perishable goods go through here,"" says Dylan Williams, from the Isle of Anglesey County Council, ""so any delays will have a big impact. And this port is a critical component of the local community as well.  ""When you look at all the potential implications and scenarios (of Brexit),"" he sighs, ""they are simply too big to get your head around and put a proper plan in place."" About 80 miles from Holyhead, just north of Wrexham, Platts is a family firm that makes specialist animal bedding out of sawdust. Ireland is its only export market and its lorries pass through Holyhead several times a week. ""Two years ago we were over in India looking at exporting over there,"" says Caroline Thedens, Platts' managing director. ""But Ireland is a lot closer for us and that's part of our growth strategy over the next few years.""For now, though, the introduction of new technology in its factory, aimed at boosting its exports to Ireland, has been put on hold. ""With Brexit looming that is the uncertainty,"" she says, ""and we may have to change our focus and re-evaluate what we do. Hopefully they can broker a good deal for all parties concerned."" The words Brexit and uncertainty never seem too far apart in places like Holyhead, but there's also discussion of solutions. Could some checks be done on board ferries, for example, as they cross the Irish Sea? Or at factories before they arrive at the port?Mr Davies hopes the challenge ahead will not be insurmountable. ""Whereas we have short-term concerns about the clarity of Brexit,"" he says, ""long term we still see good growth. But free trade is the key element."" Please upgrade your browserHolyhead certainly needs to maintain its competitive advantage. Some companies are increasing capacity on alternative trade routes that avoid the UK altogether, sending freight direct from Dublin to ports like Antwerp and Rotterdam. ""You will see some traffic transfer across,"" says Mr Potter. ""The sailing times are still very long, but there will be no border checks if you can avoid going through the UK in the future."" ""If Holyhead and the UK is bypassed and there is less economic activity,"" adds Mr Williams, ""then the long-term future of a facility like this is very much at risk."" So two big Brexit issues coincide on the Welsh coast: seamless trade across the Irish border, and seamless trade through UK ports. Holyhead is relying on both of them remaining as open as they are now. It needs a Brexit outcome that secures that.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Here is what we learned from their annual conference...In case you were in any doubt about the Liberal Democrats' position on Brexit they have spent the last four days telling anyone who'll listen that it must be stopped. ""We are absolutely solid that we need to vote against Brexit and stop it,"" leader Sir Vince Cable said. How exactly they might do that is less clear, because, as it stands, if MPs vote against a deal reached by the government with the EU, the UK would leave with no agreement in place.  A ""People's Vote"" is needed, which Sir Vince told us could be arranged ""within weeks.""Despite announcing he would step down at some point before the next general election, Sir Vince told us he would be ""pretty busy for quite a long time"".  But he also said it was ""uncertain"" whether he would still be in the job by the end of next year. Nobody in Brighton seems to know exactly how much longer Sir Vince will be leader of the party, himself included. The conference has felt a bit like the start of a long goodbye to someone who has accepted he has a limited shelf-life. The Liberal Democrats don't do anything in a hurry. Even a Q&A session with their leader in the main conference hall was strictly moderated. Members were called upon to approach the ""intervention microphone"" and offered ""supplementary questions"". Some activists made it clear they weren't convinced about their leader's plan to give non-paying supporters a say in new policy and allow non-MPs to lead the party. ""We'll be dead,"" warned one, another said they could ""end up with someone like Chuka Umunna.""The campaigner and businesswoman was given star billing on Monday, with a speech in the main hall which members seemed to love. Surely if the party is hoping to attract new people, and allow non-MPs to lead them in future, Gina Miller would be a suitable candidate? Apparently not. She ruled herself out within the first minute of her speech to enthusiastic applause. Go figure. No, it's not a joke. Or a typo. And yes, he really was due to say that in his speech. Sir Vince Cable's proposed ""colourful metaphor"" to describe Britain's exit from the European Union dominated the pre-speech headlines.  He said he wouldn't ""deconstruct it in detail"" when asked exactly what he meant on the Today programme. The point was that the people Sir Vince describes as ""the true believers"" and ""fundamentalists"" were willing to take economic pain in return for the joy of leaving the EU.Unfortunately it didn't quite work out as planned when Sir Vince delivered his speech, with him becoming a bit tongue-tied and mangling the words:Not quite the ""erotic spasm"" phrase @vincecable https://t.co/WMy4q6UWFv #politicslive pic.twitter.com/Afup8YumrTEnd of Twitter post  by @BBCPoliticsWhat could be more fun than dancing around a hotel function room with a bunch of political activists to tracks chosen by the party's current and former MPs? I for one steered well clear of the now somewhat legendary Lib Dem disco, but apparently it was Christine Jardine who won the sound clash by playing it safe with reliable floor-fillers from ABBA, Blondie and Whitney Houston.  ""It's like a wedding,"" said one person there. If the bar was free, we might've been tempted. "

But confidence fell away quickly when Theresa May lost her Commons majority. By last autumn nearly three times as many people thought the government was handling things badly (61%) as believed it was doing a good job (22%). Since the cabinet reached the Chequers agreement on how to handle the UK's future relationship with the EU, that ratio has increased further - to five to one. Leave voters have become much more critical, with only about 20% thinking the government is doing well, compared with 70% who feel it is doing badly.But voters are critical not only of the government. The polling organisation NatCen recently found 57% think the EU is handling the talks badly, while only 16% believe it is doing well.Meanwhile, polls consistently find that voters are still more likely to trust the Conservatives than Labour on the issue. Voters have also become increasingly pessimistic about how good a deal the UK will get. Until last year's general election, more people agreed than disagreed that the prime minister would secure a good deal, but thereafter, monthly polls have suggested that only about a third think the UK will get the right deal, while nearly half do not. Confidence fell yet further after the Chequers agreement. In ORB's most recent poll just 22% agreed that the prime minister will get the right deal, while 59% disagreed.Unsurprisingly, those who voted Remain have long been pessimistic. Even as long ago as September 2016, only 17% thought the UK would secure a good outcome.But doubts are now also widespread among Leave voters. According to NatCen, 40% now think the UK will get a bad deal, while just 22% reckon it will get a good one.More voters think that Brexit will be bad for the economy than believe it will be beneficial. That was also the position before the referendum. However, despite the continuing debate about the economic consequences of Brexit, the balance of opinion has shifted little. According to ICM's most recent poll, 44% of people think Brexit will be bad for the economy. That is an almost identical proportion to the 43% who held that view 18 months ago.But attitudes towards the economic consequences do seem to influence whether voters would vote the same way in another referendum.  Only about half of Leave voters who now think that Brexit will be bad for the economy would vote the same way again, a recent NatCen survey found. And only two-fifths of Remain voters who now think the economy will be better off after Brexit would vote to stay in the EU again.Immigration was a key issue for many of those who voted Leave in 2016, in part due to the EU's rules on freedom of movement.  However, some recent polling has suggested that the level of concern has declined. The proportion of people who think the rules on immigration should be the same for EU residents as those from elsewhere in the world fell from 74% in autumn 2016 to 59% now, according to NatCen.But many polls suggest voters remain more or less evenly divided over whether it is more important for the UK to end freedom of movement or stay in the EU's single market.  While most Remain supporters think it is more important to stay in the single market, most of those who voted Leave think ending freedom of movement is more important.Please upgrade your browserRead the full glossary here Before last year's general election, polls that asked people how they would vote if the referendum question was asked again often found a small majority in favour of Leave. But since then, nearly every poll has found a small majority saying that they would vote Remain. However, there is no consistent evidence suggesting that support for Remain has subsequently increased further. The UK remains more or less evenly divided on the merits of Brexit.Some polls find that those who voted Leave are a little less likely than those who backed Remain to say that they would vote the same way again.But this is not the only reason why there appears to have been a small swing to Remain since the referendum. All polls find that those who did not vote in 2016 - in some cases because they were too young to do so - are more likely to say they would vote Remain rather than Leave. So, should another referendum ever be held, the outcome might well depend on who turns out.More like thisWhether people support a second referendum depends on what they are asked.Polls that ask whether voters should have the final say on Brexit typically find more support for the idea than those that simply ask if there should be another referendum.Similarly, polls that ask whether there should be another ballot tend to find more support than those specifying the choice would be between accepting whatever deal is agreed and remaining in the EU.  The question that has been asked most often is: ""Do you think there should be a second referendum to accept or reject the terms of Britain's exit from the EU once they have been agreed?""This idea has gradually become more popular - even more so in the wake of the Chequers agreement. But there may still not be a majority in favour.Unsurprisingly perhaps, this is an issue on which Remain and Leave supporters disagree. Irrespective of how they ask about it, polls typically find that around two-thirds of Remain voters would like another ballot However, the majority - maybe as many as two-thirds - of those who backed Leave are against the idea.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.Sir John Curtice is professor of politics at Strathclyde University, senior fellow at NatCen Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK but talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan, which was the UK's official view of a proposed Brexit deal.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May held an awayday for the cabinet at her country residence - Chequers - in July. At this gathering a favoured UK position for Brexit talks was agreed. It included proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals and says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland.

The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-21,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180922065410/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-09-22,Labour 'would back members' on Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20180923063207/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45616308,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour's leader and deputy leader say they would be ready to back another EU referendum if party members want one.Leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Sunday Mirror he was not calling for a new vote but would ""adhere to"" any decision made at this week's party conference.And deputy leader Tom Watson, speaking to the Observer, said the view of party members must be respected.It comes as a poll for the newspaper suggests 86% of members want a vote on the outcome of Brexit negotiations.The party has never formally rejected the option of a further vote but both Mr Corbyn and Mr Watson have indicated they would prefer the issue to be resolved by a general election.The party has made several policy announcements ahead of its annual party conference - which begins in Liverpool later - including:However, campaigners are expected to use the conference to pile pressure on the Labour leadership to support a further referendum, with MPs and union leaders set to join a march calling for the leadership to back the so-called People's Vote. And more than 100 constituency parties have already submitted motions calling for the Labour policy on Brexit to be put to a vote.It will be up to representatives of those local Labour parties to get together and put all their different motions into one ""composite"" motion that is acceptable to everyone.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the final wording of any motion would be crucial and that Mr Corbyn would be hoping it did not tie his hands - but that some members would be pushing for a clear commitment to a new referendum.In his interview with the Sunday Mirror, Mr Corbyn said: ""What comes out of conference I will adhere to.""I'm not calling for a second referendum. I hope we will agree that the best way of resolving this is a general election.""But I was elected to empower the members of the party. So if conference makes a decision I will not walk away from it and I will act accordingly.""Meanwhile, Mr Watson told the Observer there was ""going to be pressure"" for Labour to commit to another Brexit vote in its next election manifesto.He said: ""Jeremy and I were elected in 2015 to give the Labour party back to its members.""So if the people's party decide they want the people to have a final say on the deal, we have to respect the view of our members and we will go out and argue for it.""According to the YouGov survey of 1,054 Labour members, commissioned by the People's Vote campaign, 86% wanted a final, public say on the outcome of Brexit negotiations, against 8% who opposed it.But the Brexit supporting Labour MP Kate Hoey described calls for another vote as the ""last gasp"" of people who had never wanted to accept the result of the 2016 referendum.""If we have another referendum and it's even bigger, as I think it would be actually, after the way we've seen the EU treat, not just our prime minister but actually insult our whole country in the past few days, if it was a bigger majority to leave, we're still in the same position,"" she said.And on Saturday shadow chancellor John McDonnell said people calling for a second referendum should take into account the ""real risk"" it could stoke racial tensions and far-right populism.Ahead of the conference Labour's ruling National Executive Committee agreed changes to the party's rules to give grassroots activists and trade unions more say in who can stand in future leadership elections.The NEC, meeting in Liverpool, also agreed reforms to make it easier to deselect sitting MPs and backed the creation of a second deputy leadership post.By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondentTwo significant shifts have happened on the eve of Labour conference and they both involve Tom Watson.While not technically departing from the party's official line that a new Brexit referendum shouldn't be ""off the table"" but an election is preferable, the deputy leader is sounding far warmer to the referendum idea after a poll of Labour members suggested 86% would back one.He has suggested that if there were an early election then there would be pressure to make a referendum a manifesto commitment. His views are important because - like Jeremy Corbyn - he has a mandate from the membership.But another development should not be understated.Labour's National Executive has decided to recommend the creation of an additional deputy leadership post.That raises the prospect of a candidate standing on a platform of new EU referendum. If they get that mandate, the pressure on the existing leadership to change position could reach boiling point.Iain Watson: Pressure builds on Labour for new EU voteThe UK electorate voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.89% to 48.11% in a referendum in June 2016.It is due to leave on 29 March 2019, under the terms of the two-year Article 50 process, and has been negotiating with the 27 remaining EU nations on the terms of its withdrawal and its future relationship with the bloc.However, Theresa May's plan for Brexit - known as the Chequers agreement - was rejected by EU leaders as unworkable at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday.The prime minister later said the EU's rejection of her plan without offering an alternative was ""unacceptable"" and made it clear she was ready to walk away from the negotiations rather than accept a ""bad deal""."
2018-09-22,Hunt: Don't mistake politeness for weakness,https://web.archive.org//web/20180923063207/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45611738,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has urged the EU not to mistake British politeness for weakness after Brexit negotiations reached an impasse.After rejecting the UK's proposals, Donald Tusk, head of the European Council, posted a provocative picture on Instagram featuring UK PM Theresa May ""cherry-picking"" a cake.Mr Tusk has since said he admires Mrs May, and a compromise is possible.But Mr Hunt said Mr Tusk needed to avoid ""revving up"" the situation.He insisted it was time for people in the EU ""to step back from the abyss"" of a no-deal Brexit, to ""sit down and to talk to us about how we can make these sensible, concrete proposals actually work"".In an interview with Ireland's RTE Radio, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had told him a treaty for the withdrawal of the UK from the EU was 87% agreed.This week, Mrs May tried to sell her proposals for the UK's future relationship with the EU at a summit in Salzburg, Austria.The plan - the so-called Chequers agreement - was agreed by the UK government in July.But EU leaders rejected a major part of her plan, saying the new economic partnership she had put forward would ""not work"" and risked ""undermining the single market"".Mrs May later delivered a televised statement in Downing Street in which she said the EU's rejection of her plan without offering an alternative was ""unacceptable"".She also made it clear she was ready to walk away from the negotiations rather than accept a ""bad deal"".On Saturday, Mr Hunt said the UK was still waiting for a ""detailed response"" from the EU and criticised its approach to negotiations so far.""What Theresa May is saying is 'don't mistake British politeness for weakness',"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""If you put us in a difficult corner, we will stand our ground - that is the kind of country we are.""In a reference to Mr Tusk's Instagram post and French President Emmanuel Macron's comment that Brexit campaigners were liars, Mr Hunt added: ""Insulting her on social media, getting to these stand-offs where you are calling people liars and so on is not the way we are going to get a solution to this difficult situation.""Mr Hunt refused to rule out the prospect that the government could now seek a Canada-style free trade agreement - as many Conservative MPs want, rather than the more ambitious Chequers plan.Canada's deal with the EU, signed in 2016, removes the vast majority of customs duties on EU exports to Canada and Canadian exports to the EU - but without Canada paying for access to the single market.""I am not dismissing anything,"" said Mr Hunt.""We think these proposals are better than the Canada proposals because they work better on the Northern Irish border.""The land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member, has been a stumbling block in negotiations.Both sides agree they do not want a return to a ""hard border"", such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras, but the wording is proving hard to agree on.The Irish foreign minster also expressed concern about the role of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which is currently propping up Theresa May's Conservative government.The DUP has repeatedly said it would not accept any proposal that meant Northern Ireland would be treated differently to the rest of the United Kingdom.In his RTE interview Simon Coveney said no one party should be allowed to veto proposals on the Northern Ireland border, and that negotiations were turning into a unionist versus nationalist issue.On Friday, Mr Tusk said Britain had known about the EU's reservations over the Chequers plan for weeks.He added that EU leaders at the summit had treated her proposals with ""all seriousness"" and said he was ""convinced that a compromise, good for all, is still possible"".French minister for European affairs Nathalie Loiseau said that, while France still believed a good Brexit deal was possible, it must also prepare for a no-deal outcome.Britain's vote to leave ""cannot lead to the EU going bust"", she said on France Info radio. ""That's the message we have tried to send for several months now to our British counterparts who may have thought we were going to say 'yes' to whatever deal they came up with,"" she said.Please upgrade your browserGerman deputy foreign minister Michael Roth said the EU was striving to achieve ""sensible solutions"". ""The blame game against the EU is therefore more than unfair. We can't solve the problems that are arising on the island,"" he said on Twitter.The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - but the two sides are trying to reach a deal on trade, and other areas of co-operation, by November so it can be ratified in time."

The MEP said of the EU: ""They are a bunch of gangsters. We will explain a free trade deal is possible, if that's what the gangsters in Brussels want.""If they don't, that is fine, if they don't we will leave with no deal. No deal, no problem.""Theresa May's plan for Brexit - known as the Chequers agreement - was rejected by EU leaders as unworkable at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday.Mrs May later said the EU's rejection of her plan without offering an alternative was ""unacceptable"" and made it clear she was ready to walk away from the negotiations rather than accept a ""bad deal"".Mr Farage criticised the Chequers proposals, saying they were ""dead"" and do not work for the EU or the UK.Mr Davis had been leading the UK negotiations to leave the EU but quit the cabinet in July, saying he did not ""believe"" in the Chequers plan.He told Saturday's rally: ""We have nothing to fear and that is the reason why we should only accept a clean and clear Brexit, not some fudge.""Mr Davis also said he viewed the EU's treatment of Mrs May ""with contempt"", adding: ""Bad manners and discourtesy are not the hallmarks of great men.""He continued: ""And if you think you can bully our country, all I can suggest is that you read some history books.""Labour MP Kate Hoey also spoke at the rally, saying: ""We don't need another vote - we just want to leave.""""Our vote matters and we won't allow it to be stolen from us,"" she said.She also said Brussels had never negotiated Brexit in ""good faith"".""They underestimate how strong we are when we are up against it,"" she added.It was a full house at the University of Bolton Stadium. An audience of more than 2,000 people squeezed into what was decked out like a ballroom. A stall selling Leave Means Leave baseball hats did excellent trade.In Bolton, 58% voted to leave the EU in June 2016 and, as they queued to get in, many told how passionate they were to secure the kind of Brexit they voted for. They said they felt the result of the referendum was not being taken seriously enough. The audience had come from around the country, some waved union flags; others wore them.The loudest of the applause was reserved for Nigel Farage who started by saying: ""I didn't think I'd have to do this again."" That got laughs.  Earlier he took an open top bus into Bolton to speak to shoppers and market traders, the media in tow. It all felt a bit like going back to the referendum campaign."
2018-09-22,Labour 'could nationalise rail in five years',https://web.archive.org//web/20180923063207/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45609604,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe rail industry could be completely renationalised within five years if Labour wins the next election, the shadow chancellor has suggested.John McDonnell said he was looking at whether break clauses in contracts could allow rail franchises to be taken into public hands before they expired.He is planning to create a new unit in the Treasury to oversee the party's wider nationalisation plans.It would advise on issues such as possible compensation for shareholders.Mr McDonnell was asked about the party's nationalisation plans in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme ahead of Labour's annual conference in Liverpool.The party's 2017 manifesto included a pledge to bring private rail companies back into public ownership as their franchises expired.However, some franchises are set to continue for many years and the party has said it could use break clauses in contracts to take control sooner. There are currently 18 franchises in England, Scotland and Wales.With the odd exception, the shortest contracts run for seven years, although 10 years is more common.Northern Ireland's rail system has remained nationalised since 1948.The train operating companies are not responsible for track maintenance, which falls to publicly owned Network Rail.Asked whether it was possible all the franchises could be in public hands in the first term of a Labour government Mr McDonnell added: ""I think that's possible. That's why we're working through the detail now of how that can be done. ""And if you look at what's happened over time a number of these franchises have been handed back anyway.""His broader plan is for Labour to establish a Public Ownership Unit to develop legal and financial plans to bring private industries into the state sector, and set out a timetable for action.It would advise on how much compensation shareholders would receive and help decide which Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs) should be nationalised.Labour is keen to present itself as ready for office in the event of an early general election.Mr McDonnell said: ""We will have new structures of government. ""I'll be ready on day one going into government to be able to bring forward the legislation, to implement the policy.""Mr McDonnell argued his plans were cost neutral because the cash generated by newly acquired private companies would cover the cost of financing the debt needed to buy them. There would be enough money left over, he said, to increase investment and reduce consumers' bills.But he declined to say how much extra borrowing would be required to purchase private assets.Shareholders in private companies would receive bonds - government debt - in return for their shares. The new Treasury unit would advise what level of compensation they were due, with the final decision made by Parliament.PFI is a way of financing investment in public infrastructure using private capital. Private firms stump up the cost of building facilities - such as a hospital or school - and, in return, the state makes payments over a period of time - often about 25 years - for their use and management.The model has been attractive to governments of all political persuasions as it limits upfront capital expenditure and reduces risk while future payment obligations do not count towards the national debt. However, its value for money has long been questioned. As of March 2016 there were 716 PFI projects, 686 of which were still operational. The others had either been cancelled or had reached the end of the contract period.The SNP government stopped new PFI contracts when it came to power in Scotland, replacing them with NPDs (non-profit distributing projects).Labour intends to take control of PFIs by nationalising Special Purpose Vehicles - the companies established to run them. Typically, investors would be compensated and Labour would follow legal advice, Mr McDonnell said.But he added: ""There might be some factors in relation to some operations of PFIs in particular that could be brought forward that says actually there is no compensatory arrangements needed here.""The party's annual conference - staged under the slogan ""Rebuilding Britain, for the many, not the few"" - is due to begin in Liverpool on Sunday, with the party pledging to ""put equality centre stage"".It will close on Wednesday with a major speech by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is coming under pressure to back a referendum on the final Brexit deal - he has so far insisted he wants to see a general election instead.Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) is due to meet later on Saturday, the day before the main conference begins, to discuss changes to leadership election rules."

Shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler unveiled the policy at the party's Women's Conference in Liverpool.The proposals aim to give victims time to leave abusive partners safely and seek support. Ms Butler said the policy would save lives and tackle the ""hidden killer"" of domestic abuse. Speaking ahead of the launch of Labour's annual conference on Sunday, Ms Butler told the conference employers had a ""duty of care"" to employees experiencing domestic abuse.""This crucial time will allow women and men to leave their abusive partners safely - get the help, protection and support they need knowing their livelihood is secure.""On average two women a week are murdered by their current or former abusive partner. These 10 days could literally help save the lives of those women.""Similar laws have already been introduced in the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand, she added.Ms Butler also announced plans to set up a new department for Women and Equalities, as part of Labour's pledge to ""put equality centre stage"".""So far we have seen seven different ministers for equality tagged on to four different departments and a budget that's nearly been halved,"" she told the conference. ""This proves the Tories are not taking equalities seriously. By establishing a Department for Women and Equalities, Labour will ensure equalities is the common thread running through its government""The annual Labour conference - staged under the slogan ""Rebuilding Britain, for the many, not the few"" - will start on Sunday, and close on Wednesday with a major speech by Mr Corbyn.The stage is set for fierce debates about Brexit and the future of the party at the Liverpool gathering. Lively debates -yes even divisions - are expected at this year's gathering. Labour's NEC meets tonight to hammer out new leadership rules that are likely to see the influence of MPs watered down in favour of more say for members and the unions. And tomorrow behind the scenes there will be wrangles over how to boil down 125 Brexit motions to just two or three - with some members wanting to push the leadership further than it wants to go in calling for a new referendum on the EU.But it's often the unanticipated divisions that can cause the bigger problem. Dawn Butler not only praised the 1980s Militant-led Liverpool council in her speech to the women's conference today - but she also suggested it was better to break the law than break the poor. Some in the party are furious that she has gifted the Conservatives a weapon of attack. Party policy is for councillors to set legal budgets - but Labour's opponents can now question its sincerity. "
2018-09-22,Brexit: What happens next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180923063207/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45601502,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has warned that the Brexit negotiations are at an impasse and there will be no progress until the EU treats her proposals seriously.She has accused EU leaders of showing the UK a lack of respect after they rebuffed her Chequers plan without, she said, any alternative or explanation. With the clock counting down to the UK's scheduled exit on 29 March 2019, where does this latest row leave the chances of a deal and what could happen next in the Brexit process?Thursday's gathering of European leaders in Salzburg was supposed to help bridge outstanding differences and pave the way for a potential deal by the middle of November at the latest.But instead, it has driven a wedge between the UK and the EU, with accusations of bad faith and ""un-statesmanlike"" behaviour.Mrs May has said the two sides remain ""a long way"" apart on the crucial issues of how the UK will trade with the EU after Brexit and the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.She reiterated again her belief that her Chequers blueprint was the only way of properly implementing Brexit and also ensuring a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU in the future. Please upgrade your browserThe PM, visibly angered by the reception she got from her fellow leaders in Austria, also rejected the two options put on the table by the EU - a Norway-style association agreement and a much looser relationship based on Canada's trade deal with the EU. For its part, the EU has said the Chequers plan is unworkable as it fragments the single market. The next few weeks will be crucial if these differences are to be resolved and the two sides are to fulfil their shared aim of an orderly Brexit and an outline agreement on trade, security and other issues. Mrs May has suffered plenty of Brexit setbacks in the past and soldiered on and it looks like she is determined to do so again.The only problem is that many of her own MPs don't think she is going about the process of leaving the EU the right way.The number of Tories who say they won't vote for the Chequers plan seems to be growing by the day and, remember, any deal she negotiates with the EU has to get through Parliament.There is enormous pressure from the Brexiteer-wing of the party for her to rip up Chequers and throw her weight behind a turbo-charged version of Canada's deal with the EU.The so-called Canada Plus Plus option, which removes most customs duties on goods but without paying for access to the single market, is backed by Boris Johnson, David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg, among others, who believe the UK Parliament will vote for it.Many Conservative Remainers, like former minister Justine Greening, have also lost faith in Chequers and think there should be a referendum (more of that later) while some Tories think the UK may well end up in a temporary European Economic Area-style arrangement, sometimes called the Norway option. This would mean accepting the free movement of people and the indirect recognition of European Court of Justice rulings - but would allow businesses access to the EU single market, with some strings attached.Amid speculation about further cabinet resignations if she persists with Chequers, calls for the PM to think again are likely to reach a crescendo at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham.If the PM does not shift on the substance of her Chequers plan, expect much frenzied talk of leadership challenges.Salzburg may have caused a dust-up but it hasn't changed the underlying reality that both sides want as amicable a divorce as possible.Some Tory MPs favour a clean break with the EU, which would see the UK fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization, the global body governing international trade, but they are in a minority.Both sides are ramping up talk of no-deal contingency planning.But they also know that such an outcome would be seen as a political failure and a disaster for business - particularly as the 21-month transition period planned after Brexit day would be scrapped.A summit on 18-19 October of EU leaders was, for a long time, pencilled in as the moment that the two sides would have to look each other in the eye and reach a deal.However, this is not now seen as feasible and the focus is on a special one-off summit that has been arranged for mid-November.An agreement then, the thinking goes, would still allow enough time for the UK and European Parliaments and a supermajority of European states - that's 20 out of 27 - to ratify any deal before the 29 March deadline.So, the clock is ticking but the EU is renowned for finalising deals at the 11th hour and it wouldn't be the first time the talks have seemed on the brink of collapse only for a deal to be pulled out of the fire. If she brings a deal back from Brussels, Theresa May has another big hurdle to negotiate. She must persuade Parliament to back it, in a vote likely before the end of the year or in early 2019.Tory Brexiteers opposed to Chequers have suggested up to 80 MPs would be prepared to vote against it. Although we don't know what the final deal will look like and the size of any rebellion would, in all likelihood, be much smaller, even a dozen Conservatives defying the leadership would risk defeat for the PM, with her non-existent Commons majority.The opposition parties are unlikely to come to the PM's aid, with Labour saying any deal is unlikely to pass its six tests guaranteeing workers' rights and all the ""benefits"" of the single market and customs union.The Labour leadership is hoping to inflict a defeat as a way of triggering a general election.It is written into law that the UK will be leaving at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019, two years to the day after the government notified the EU of its intention to quit, by triggering Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty. But if there is no deal or Parliament rejects the deal, we are in uncharted territory and it is impossible to say with any certainty what will happen next.Mrs May has insisted the 2016 referendum result will not be overturned but if Parliament cannot agree on what kind of Brexit it wants, a fresh public vote might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. There are a growing number of people who believe this is the case, although they are largely confined to people who voted Remain in 2016 and they can't all agree on what question should be asked on the ballot paper.The Liberal Democrats and the cross-party People's Vote campaign, backed by about 30 Labour MPs, five Conservatives, the four Plaid Cymru MPs and Green MP Caroline Lucas, wants the option to stay in the EU to be put before voters.Critics say there won't be enough time for another referendum - and Mrs May has explicitly ruled out extending the two-year Article 50 process, amid reports EU leaders might be open to that.However, and it is a big however, should Mrs May resign in the event of her deal being rejected, her successor would have a new mandate. Some European leaders believe Brexit can be halted but, in the absence of a referendum, the only other way this could conceivably happen is if there were a general election before 29 March next year. A new government with a majority would have the power to delay or reverse the process but whether it would have the desire - given Labour's policy so far has been to respect the Brexit vote - is another matter entirely.If the UK does leave as planned, it is far from the end of the story. It is only then that discussions about future co-operation - including a trade deal - will really begin in earnest. "

The party's interim manifesto includes sections on free speech, political correctness and Islamic extremism, as well as the NHS, defence, education and policing among others.It urges a ""complete and total withdrawal from the European Union"", and says UKIP will keep fighting to make the UK an ""independent, self-governing, sovereign state"", regardless of any Brexit deal reached. In it, Mr Batten says UKIP will ""promote and defend our national and individual freedoms"" adding: ""We are determined to protect our freedom of speech and the right to speak our minds without fear of the politically correct thought-police knocking on our doors.""The manifesto covers a wide range of policy areas, from the NHS and transport to fisheries and small businesses, with policies including: Mr Batten, who took over as leader in February but has said he intends to resign after a year, said: ""These policies are aimed at helping the people who form the backbone of Britain: ordinary workers and taxpayers, the unemployed who would like to work, and small and medium-sized business owners.""""Its purpose is to make UKIP a populist party in the real meaning of the word - one whose policies are popular with voters.""The UKIP leader has hit back at claims of growing links between the party and far-right groups, telling Sky News he was ""entitled to speak at rallies organised by people who believe in democracy"". Mr Batten said Tommy Robinson would not be admitted to UKIP ""in the near future"" because it would require changes to the party's rules.But Mr Farage, who has returned to the domestic political fray with a campaign to ""save Brexit"", said UKIP risked ""total and utter marginalisation"" unless it changed direction.He told the Press Association he was ""totally opposed"" to allowing Mr Robinson into the party. ""I wrote very explicitly into the rules of the party when I first became leader: we did not want anybody in the party that had taints with organisations we deemed to be on the far right of British politics,"" he said.""It really upsets me to see the fact this debate is even taking place.""UKIP, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, saw its popularity collapse in the 2017 election after securing only 594,068 votes - down from 3,881,099 in 2015.The party leadership has changed hands six times since the 2016 EU referendum, with Mr Farage returning temporarily when his successor Diane James quit after less than a month at the helm. Paul Nuttall succeeded her in November 2016 but quit following the 2017 general election - and Steve Crowther became acting leader. Henry Bolton was elected leader in September 2017 but was ousted following controversy over racist messages sent by his partner. "

The cross-party group of politicians argue that Article 50 can be revoked if MPs vote to do so.The Court of Session in Edinburgh had previously rejected their bid to have the case referred to European judges. But they have now won an appeal, and the European Court of Justice will be asked to give a definitive ruling.The panel of appeal judges at the Court of Session said the ""urgency of the issue"" - with the UK due to leave the EU on 29 March - meant its request to the European Court was being done under expedited procedure.The UK government said it was ""disappointed"" by the decision and was giving it ""careful consideration"". But a spokesman stressed that the government remained committed to implementing the result of the EU referendum and ""will not be revoking Article 50.""The legal case has been brought by politicians including Scottish Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, Labour MEPs David Martin and Catherine Stihler and SNP MEP Alyn Smith, who have claimed that Brexit is ""not inevitable"" and ""there is still time to change course"". Welcoming the ruling, Mr Greer said: ""If negotiations collapse, as appears to be happening, we have to know that a no deal disaster is not the only option on the table.""The politicians have been joined by lawyer Jolyon Maugham QC, the director of the Good Law Project, who said the latest ruling was a ""bombshell"" that could ""decide the fate of the nation"" and potentially allow the country to ""wake up from the nightmare that is this government's Brexit"".BIG ð´ó §ó ¢ó ³ó £ó ´ó ¿ðªðºNEWS! Scotlandâs Court of Session has agreed to refer our case to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg for a ruling on how to revoke Article 50. Brexit is not inevitable, there is still time to change course. https://t.co/qhAL4wPDdrEnd of Twitter post  by @AlynSmithPrime Minister Theresa May has admitted that negotiations with the EU have reached an ""impasse"" after her Brexit plans were rejected at a summit in Salzburg earlier this week. But in a speech outside Downing Street she insisted that: ""Nobody wants a good deal more than me - but I will not overturn the result of the referendum, nor will I break up my country.""The speech was described as ""dreadful"" by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who claimed Mrs May's so-called Chequers proposals for Brexit were now a ""dead duck"" and that Brexit ""should not happen"" if the PM was not going to keep the country in the single market and customs union.The petitioners argue that the UK should now effectively be allowed to change its mind on Brexit, without needing the permission of the other 27 EU members.If it is successful, their case could strengthen the hand of any attempt by MPs to keep the UK in the EU after the final details of its departure terms are known. This is because it would give parliament the power to unilaterally halt Brexit if it feels any final deal - or no deal - is unacceptable, even if the government wants to leave regardless.Court of Session judge Lord Boyd ruled in June that the case could not go to the European Court in Luxembourg as it was ""hypothetical"" and did not reflect political reality as it ""seems highly unlikely that this government will revoke the notification"".The campaigners appealed against that decision, and on Friday the court ruled in their favour.The ruling was delivered by Scotland's most senior judge, Lord Carloway, and his colleagues Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond Young.The appeal judges said matters had ""moved on"" since Lord Boyd's original ruling, with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act now setting out how parliamentary approval is to be sought once the negotiations between the UK government and the EU conclude. Lord Carloway said it was therefore ""clear"" that MPs at Westminster would be required to vote on any Brexit deal agreed by the EU and the UK government.He stated: ""It seems neither academic nor premature to ask whether it is legally competent to revoke the notification and thus to remain in the EU. ""The matter is uncertain in that it is the subject of a dispute; as this litigation perhaps demonstrates.""The answer will have the effect of clarifying the options open to MPs in the lead up to what is now an inevitable vote.""The judge also said the European court would not be advising parliament on ""what it must or ought to do"".Instead, he said it would be ""merely declaring the law as part of its central function"", adding that ""how parliament chooses to react to that declarator is entirely a matter for that institution"".In their draft reference to the European Court, the judges ask: ""Where a member state has notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the European Union, does EU law permit that notice to be revoked unilaterally by the notifying member state?""And, if so, subject to what conditions and with what effect relative to the member state remaining within the EU?"""
2018-09-22,Pound falls after May's Brexit statement,https://web.archive.org//web/20180923063207/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45604230,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe pound's fall against the dollar and the euro has deepened following Theresa May's assertion after an EU summit that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"".Sterling was already trading lower after EU leaders warned the UK must make compromises on trade and the Irish border to secure a Brexit trade deal. After the Prime Minister said the UK and EU were at an ""impasse"" the pound fell further.The pound dropped from 1% to 1.5% lower against the dollar to $1.3068.By the end of US trading, the pound was on track for its biggest daily drop against the dollar so far this year. Against the euro, the pound was down 1.1% at â¬1.1144 after Mrs May's statement.""The rhetoric that 'no deal is better than a bad deal' is startling, and undermines recent hopes that a deal could be finalised soon,"" said Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX.Business bodies reacted with alarm to the latest development. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned that the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal was a big concern for firms. ""Many firms are hugely worried about a messy and disorderly outcome, and the potential impact on their ability to trade and grow. Others could be caught flat-footed. Both sides must make every effort to avoid this scenario,"" said BCC director general Adam Marshall.Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, said negotiators on both sides had to change tack.""The stakes could not be higher. Jobs, wages and living standards are at risk, on both sides of the Channel. ""With time slipping away, employers and employees alike need to see constructive dialogue. Pragmatism must come before politics. Every day lost in rhetoric is lost investment and lost jobs,"" she added. Mrs May's statement followed a cool reception for her Chequers plan at a summit of EU leaders in Salzburg.She said the two sides were still ""a long way apart"" on the post-Brexit economic relationship.The two options being offered by the EU - for the UK to stay in the European Economic Area and customs union or a basic free trade agreement - were not acceptable, she said.She said EU leaders needed to come up with new alternatives to her Brexit proposals if both sides were to break the current deadlock.""It is not acceptable to simply reject the other side's proposals without a detailed explanation and counter-proposals,"" Mrs May said.

It is understood that key witnesses including Mr Yousaf were not contacted during the internal Labour investigation as Mr Dempster, a Dumfries and Galloway councillor, admitted making the remark.Mr Corbyn told BBC Scotland: ""What I would make clear is that first of all as a party we don't tolerate racism in any form, I as party leader do not tolerate racism in any form. ""It is all investigated as quickly as it can be investigated and appropriate action is taken - there's a range of actions that can be taken by our national executive.""He added: ""The issues that face us all are the need to be united and not allow racism to fester any more than we would allow the far-right to rise anywhere across this country.""A Scottish Labour spokesman insisted that the party takes any allegations of racism ""extremely seriously"".He added: ""All complaints about Islamophobia are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken.""But a party source told BBC Scotland that it ""needs to take a look at why the disciplinary process takes so long, because it isn't fair for victims.""The party can't just talk about having a zero tolerance approach to racism, it must practice it as well.""But Mr Yousaf hit out on Twitter, saying six months had now passed since Mr Dempster was suspended from Labour after he ""admitted Islamophobia"".The justice secretary said: ""He should have been expelled. What have Labour done in six months? Zero, zilch, nada.""Let's call Corbyn out - he is utterly duplicitous when it comes to tackling racism in his own party.""He says many warm words then fails miserably to follow it up with any action. He is a hypocrite and has been exposed as one time and time again.""Allegations first emerged in March that Mr Dempster had made the comments about Mr Yousaf in a meeting with officials from Transport Scotland.He is said to have told them no-one would have noticed Mr Yousaf because no-one would have seen him under his burka. He was suspended by the party and subsequently apologised to Mr Yousaf, saying he was ashamed and embarrassed and could offer no defence or explanation."

""Brexit will have consequences for the Netherlands no matter what"" and ""everything must be done"" to prevent a no-deal Brexit, it quotes him as saying. The Netherlands has a greater interest in a ""decent deal"" than other EU countries, given the Dutch economy's reliance on exports, the daily says. ""Brexit is threatening our exports, our jobs, and our wallets,"" De Telegraaf quotes Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra as saying. Mr Hoekstra lists Brexit as one of the risks to Dutch economic growth, alongside geopolitical instability and trade conflicts, the daily notes. ""The Dutch government is preparing for chaos and problems"" when the UK leaves the EU, broadcaster RTL observes. Belgium's De Standaard quotes Economy Minister Kris Peeters as saying that a no-deal hard Brexit ""remains a very realistic option for now"". The paper notes that much is at stake for Belgium since 10% of its exports go to the UK, accounting for 40,000 dependent jobs.In Slovakia, Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Frantisek Ruzicka says a hard Brexit would have a ""direct impact on Slovak citizens living in the UK, trade, and services"", Teraz.sk website reports. Mr Ruzicka says Slovakia hopes the UK will be able to negotiate a political deal with the EU.  Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said at the EU summit on Brexit in Salzburg that ""we really care about ending the impasse between the UK and Europe"" and he called for stability for Polish citizens and businesses in the UK. Mr Morawiecki acknowledged that the negotiations had been nerve-racking, according to Gazeta Prawna.""In Austria, the 27 should understand that the Irish issue is the only difficulty on the way to making an agreement,"" France's Le Monde states. It notes that Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is pursuing a strategy of ""de-dramatisation"", showing a ""willingness to compromise"" on the backstop proposal for the Irish border. At the same time, European leaders are preparing to limit the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, the daily says. After all, London is pursuing ""intense lobbying to try to divide the Continental front"".Salzburg could be an ""occasion to start off on the right foot again"" after a ""summer of continued crises"" - but ""this will not be the case"", France's Le Figaro believes.  Theresa May is ""one of the few adults"" among the ""big kids of London"", Germany's centre-left Spiegel says. And this is why politicians are inclined to be friendly to her.But Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung notes that Brussels does not want to make any move before the UK Conservative Party conference. ""The fear is too great that any type of constructive proposal at Salzburg will be taken down by the Brexiteers.""  ""The passivity with which above all Angela Merkel is letting Brexit make its way bureaucratically is short-sighted,"" political editor for Die Zeit, Jochen Bittner, argues. It is precisely on the matter of sovereign borders that ""Europe could accommodate Britain with the concession that a little more control would not in any way destroy Europe's union thinking"", Bittner says. ""There are already possibilities"" for a cap on immigration within the EU, ""a kind of emergency brake"", which could be an ""insurance against that fear of overloading that made many Britons vote to leave"", he says.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

The democracy review was sold as a way of empowering the membership and some on the left are fearful that it will instead further empower trade union leaders.Some local trade union branches have very few members while many of the branches consisting of fully-paid up individual party members are much larger.So a relatively small number of trade unionists could trigger a re-selection contest since it would be much easier to get 30% of trade union branches to give the sitting MP the thumbs down than 30% of the (often much larger) membership branches.There had been talk of a further compromise - giving less weight to smaller union branches.On the latest information I have, it looks like this further proposal may have been dropped.One NEC member suggested privately that the ""compromise"" - rather than either protecting sitting MPs or giving members a much greater say -  would in effect allow Unite chief Len McCluskey ""to pick off whoever he wants"".So even the ""compromise"" hasn't been agreed.Not knowingly undersold, one insider said ""it could be war"".There has also been a change to the initial proposal for selecting Jeremy Corbyn's eventual successor. What was floated at the last meeting of the NEC was a new system which would allow a candidate to get nominated with the backing of just 5% of MPs (the current threshold is 10%) so long as either 10% of local constituency parties, or 10% of unions, also nominated them.Today the NEC will discuss a new proposal - a future leader would require not only the support of 10% of MPs and local parties but would now also require the support of two trade unions that account for 5% of 'affiliated' members.Complicated as that is (and believe it or not, I have simplified the options) the upshot is that a leadership candidate wouldn't get on the ballot without the backing of some big unions.And some Momentum activists are complaining that this would skew power away from rank and file party members and are pledging to oppose it.Momentum has been pressing its members to deluge the NEC with emails calling for the leadership threshold to be reduced to 5% of MPs and for any compromise on parliamentary selections to be ditched.""Their phones are imploding under the weight of emails,"" one source said.The NEC is likely to be expanded to include, specifically, party members with disabilities and those from an ethnic minority  background. But the proposal today is that these new places will be elected equally by unions and rank-and-file members, not just by the party membership alone.After the last NEC meeting, a Corbyn-sceptic told me he had ""kicked into the long grass"" a proposal that the leaders of local authority Labour groups would be elected by the wider membership and not just by councils.Well, someone has got the political lawnmower out, because it's back on the agenda now.And local government manifestos might be drawn up not by councillors but wider local government committees which include trade union nominees.Under the current system when an NEC place chosen by the members (the unions, councillors, shadow cabinet and MPs/MEPs have their own dedicated places) becomes vacant, the runner up in the annual elections is automatically promoted onto the NEC.I understand an NEC member is considering standing down and that would mean comedian Eddie Izzard (who wasn't supported by the left) would be elevated. But under proposals to be discussed today a by-election, seen as unnecessarily expensive by opponents, would be held in future - increasing the chance of a left-wing replacementA proposal to have existing NEC members choose amongst themselves who joins them has been dropped.Clearly there are plenty of issues still to be agreed, but whatever backroom deals are done, or compromises concluded, it's likely by the end of Labour conference that it will be easier to replace sitting MPs and that it's even more likely that someone on the left (not necessarily the so-called 'hard left') will replace Jeremy Corbyn when the time comes.And that the tension between a vision of a ""members-led"" party which Momentum has been advocating, and one where the big trade unions retain power, will continue."
2018-09-22,Reality check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180923063207/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45589275,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe locals call it the Holyhead hum: it's the sound of refrigeration units attached to lorry trailers waiting, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for the next ferry bound for Dublin. This small town on Anglesey lies at the heart of one of the poorest areas in the UK. But it is also the second busiest roll-on roll-off ferry port in the country, a vital link in a seamless supply chain for businesses across the UK and Ireland. Brexit, for which Anglesey narrowly voted in the 2016 referendum, could change everything. Why? Because at the moment this is the quickest route across the Irish Sea - the sailing time from Dublin to Holyhead is just over three hours. ""At night-time,"" says Ian Davies, trade director for Stena Line, which runs Holyhead Port, ""we have 400 to 500 articulated lorries coming off two ferries within 25 minutes of each other."" If you put those lorries back-to-back, they would form a queue three miles (4.8km) long.""We've got to keep moving,"" Mr Davies says. ""We don't have the standing room to put five kilometres of freight.""In other words, any customs or regulatory checks, which could cause delays after Brexit, would be difficult to swallow. ""It seems likely that there will be some extra checks,"" says Andrew Potter, a logistics expert at Cardiff Business School, ""and planning is taking place. But without clarity about what will happen, it's difficult to know how the port will reorganise itself.""The Irish connection is even more complicated because roughly a third of the freight arriving in Holyhead from Dublin originates in Northern Ireland. That's partly because sailing times from Belfast to Liverpool are more like eight hours. It means a lot of freight from the North crosses the open Irish border by road, and still arrives in Britain more quickly.Take chicken, for example. Producers in Northern Ireland transport their meat to Dublin, and send it via Holyhead to big warehouses in the Midlands for distribution around the country.  Some of that chicken even gets sent back to supermarkets in Ireland and Northern Ireland - a reminder that the UK and Ireland really do operate at the moment as one economic space. And everyone in the supply chain, including consumers, benefits. ""A lot of perishable goods go through here,"" says Dylan Williams, from the Isle of Anglesey County Council, ""so any delays will have a big impact. And this port is a critical component of the local community as well.  ""When you look at all the potential implications and scenarios (of Brexit),"" he sighs, ""they are simply too big to get your head around and put a proper plan in place."" About 80 miles from Holyhead, just north of Wrexham, Platts is a family firm that makes specialist animal bedding out of sawdust. Ireland is its only export market and its lorries pass through Holyhead several times a week. ""Two years ago we were over in India looking at exporting over there,"" says Caroline Thedens, Platts' managing director. ""But Ireland is a lot closer for us and that's part of our growth strategy over the next few years.""For now, though, the introduction of new technology in its factory, aimed at boosting its exports to Ireland, has been put on hold. ""With Brexit looming that is the uncertainty,"" she says, ""and we may have to change our focus and re-evaluate what we do. Hopefully they can broker a good deal for all parties concerned."" The words Brexit and uncertainty never seem too far apart in places like Holyhead, but there's also discussion of solutions. Could some checks be done on board ferries, for example, as they cross the Irish Sea? Or at factories before they arrive at the port?Mr Davies hopes the challenge ahead will not be insurmountable. ""Whereas we have short-term concerns about the clarity of Brexit,"" he says, ""long term we still see good growth. But free trade is the key element."" Please upgrade your browserHolyhead certainly needs to maintain its competitive advantage. Some companies are increasing capacity on alternative trade routes that avoid the UK altogether, sending freight direct from Dublin to ports like Antwerp and Rotterdam. ""You will see some traffic transfer across,"" says Mr Potter. ""The sailing times are still very long, but there will be no border checks if you can avoid going through the UK in the future."" ""If Holyhead and the UK is bypassed and there is less economic activity,"" adds Mr Williams, ""then the long-term future of a facility like this is very much at risk."" So two big Brexit issues coincide on the Welsh coast: seamless trade across the Irish border, and seamless trade through UK ports. Holyhead is relying on both of them remaining as open as they are now. It needs a Brexit outcome that secures that.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Here is what we learned from their annual conference...In case you were in any doubt about the Liberal Democrats' position on Brexit they have spent the last four days telling anyone who'll listen that it must be stopped. ""We are absolutely solid that we need to vote against Brexit and stop it,"" leader Sir Vince Cable said. How exactly they might do that is less clear, because, as it stands, if MPs vote against a deal reached by the government with the EU, the UK would leave with no agreement in place.  A ""People's Vote"" is needed, which Sir Vince told us could be arranged ""within weeks.""Despite announcing he would step down at some point before the next general election, Sir Vince told us he would be ""pretty busy for quite a long time"".  But he also said it was ""uncertain"" whether he would still be in the job by the end of next year. Nobody in Brighton seems to know exactly how much longer Sir Vince will be leader of the party, himself included. The conference has felt a bit like the start of a long goodbye to someone who has accepted he has a limited shelf-life. The Liberal Democrats don't do anything in a hurry. Even a Q&A session with their leader in the main conference hall was strictly moderated. Members were called upon to approach the ""intervention microphone"" and offered ""supplementary questions"". Some activists made it clear they weren't convinced about their leader's plan to give non-paying supporters a say in new policy and allow non-MPs to lead the party. ""We'll be dead,"" warned one, another said they could ""end up with someone like Chuka Umunna.""The campaigner and businesswoman was given star billing on Monday, with a speech in the main hall which members seemed to love. Surely if the party is hoping to attract new people, and allow non-MPs to lead them in future, Gina Miller would be a suitable candidate? Apparently not. She ruled herself out within the first minute of her speech to enthusiastic applause. Go figure. No, it's not a joke. Or a typo. And yes, he really was due to say that in his speech. Sir Vince Cable's proposed ""colourful metaphor"" to describe Britain's exit from the European Union dominated the pre-speech headlines.  He said he wouldn't ""deconstruct it in detail"" when asked exactly what he meant on the Today programme. The point was that the people Sir Vince describes as ""the true believers"" and ""fundamentalists"" were willing to take economic pain in return for the joy of leaving the EU.Unfortunately it didn't quite work out as planned when Sir Vince delivered his speech, with him becoming a bit tongue-tied and mangling the words:Not quite the ""erotic spasm"" phrase @vincecable https://t.co/WMy4q6UWFv #politicslive pic.twitter.com/Afup8YumrTEnd of Twitter post  by @BBCPoliticsWhat could be more fun than dancing around a hotel function room with a bunch of political activists to tracks chosen by the party's current and former MPs? I for one steered well clear of the now somewhat legendary Lib Dem disco, but apparently it was Christine Jardine who won the sound clash by playing it safe with reliable floor-fillers from ABBA, Blondie and Whitney Houston.  ""It's like a wedding,"" said one person there. If the bar was free, we might've been tempted. "
2018-09-22,Poll watching,https://web.archive.org//web/20180923063207/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45520517,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK narrowly voted in favour of Leave in the EU referendum, but with six months to go until Brexit, where does the country stand now?From whether the UK should hold another referendum, to what Brexit means for the economy, the opinion polls reveal a great deal about what the country thinks.Immediately before last year's general election, as many people thought the government was handling the negotiations well as felt it was doing so badly. But confidence fell away quickly when Theresa May lost her Commons majority. By last autumn nearly three times as many people thought the government was handling things badly (61%) as believed it was doing a good job (22%). Since the cabinet reached the Chequers agreement on how to handle the UK's future relationship with the EU, that ratio has increased further - to five to one. Leave voters have become much more critical, with only about 20% thinking the government is doing well, compared with 70% who feel it is doing badly.But voters are critical not only of the government. The polling organisation NatCen recently found 57% think the EU is handling the talks badly, while only 16% believe it is doing well.Meanwhile, polls consistently find that voters are still more likely to trust the Conservatives than Labour on the issue. Voters have also become increasingly pessimistic about how good a deal the UK will get. Until last year's general election, more people agreed than disagreed that the prime minister would secure a good deal, but thereafter, monthly polls have suggested that only about a third think the UK will get the right deal, while nearly half do not. Confidence fell yet further after the Chequers agreement. In ORB's most recent poll just 22% agreed that the prime minister will get the right deal, while 59% disagreed.Unsurprisingly, those who voted Remain have long been pessimistic. Even as long ago as September 2016, only 17% thought the UK would secure a good outcome.But doubts are now also widespread among Leave voters. According to NatCen, 40% now think the UK will get a bad deal, while just 22% reckon it will get a good one.More voters think that Brexit will be bad for the economy than believe it will be beneficial. That was also the position before the referendum. However, despite the continuing debate about the economic consequences of Brexit, the balance of opinion has shifted little. According to ICM's most recent poll, 44% of people think Brexit will be bad for the economy. That is an almost identical proportion to the 43% who held that view 18 months ago.But attitudes towards the economic consequences do seem to influence whether voters would vote the same way in another referendum.  Only about half of Leave voters who now think that Brexit will be bad for the economy would vote the same way again, a recent NatCen survey found. And only two-fifths of Remain voters who now think the economy will be better off after Brexit would vote to stay in the EU again.Immigration was a key issue for many of those who voted Leave in 2016, in part due to the EU's rules on freedom of movement.  However, some recent polling has suggested that the level of concern has declined. The proportion of people who think the rules on immigration should be the same for EU residents as those from elsewhere in the world fell from 74% in autumn 2016 to 59% now, according to NatCen.But many polls suggest voters remain more or less evenly divided over whether it is more important for the UK to end freedom of movement or stay in the EU's single market.  While most Remain supporters think it is more important to stay in the single market, most of those who voted Leave think ending freedom of movement is more important.Please upgrade your browserRead the full glossary here Before last year's general election, polls that asked people how they would vote if the referendum question was asked again often found a small majority in favour of Leave. But since then, nearly every poll has found a small majority saying that they would vote Remain. However, there is no consistent evidence suggesting that support for Remain has subsequently increased further. The UK remains more or less evenly divided on the merits of Brexit.Some polls find that those who voted Leave are a little less likely than those who backed Remain to say that they would vote the same way again.But this is not the only reason why there appears to have been a small swing to Remain since the referendum. All polls find that those who did not vote in 2016 - in some cases because they were too young to do so - are more likely to say they would vote Remain rather than Leave. So, should another referendum ever be held, the outcome might well depend on who turns out.More like thisWhether people support a second referendum depends on what they are asked.Polls that ask whether voters should have the final say on Brexit typically find more support for the idea than those that simply ask if there should be another referendum.Similarly, polls that ask whether there should be another ballot tend to find more support than those specifying the choice would be between accepting whatever deal is agreed and remaining in the EU.  The question that has been asked most often is: ""Do you think there should be a second referendum to accept or reject the terms of Britain's exit from the EU once they have been agreed?""This idea has gradually become more popular - even more so in the wake of the Chequers agreement. But there may still not be a majority in favour.Unsurprisingly perhaps, this is an issue on which Remain and Leave supporters disagree. Irrespective of how they ask about it, polls typically find that around two-thirds of Remain voters would like another ballot However, the majority - maybe as many as two-thirds - of those who backed Leave are against the idea.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.Sir John Curtice is professor of politics at Strathclyde University, senior fellow at NatCen Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK but talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan, which was the UK's official view of a proposed Brexit deal.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May held an awayday for the cabinet at her country residence - Chequers - in July. At this gathering a favoured UK position for Brexit talks was agreed. It included proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals and says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland.

The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-22,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180923063207/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-09-23,Labour keeps option of fresh Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20180924081729/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45622161,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour members are to vote on keeping ""all options on the table"" on Brexit, including possibly campaigning for a new referendum, at their conference.The party's leadership wants a general election allowing Labour to take control of negotiations if it won.However some members want the party to pursue a ""people's vote"" on Brexit.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC he thought any such vote should be on the terms of a Brexit deal rather than an option to stay in the EU.He said that Labour would continue to respect the 2016 referendum, in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union.And he said a general election was needed so a Labour government could strike a Brexit deal with the EU which ""brings the country together"".But shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC the party was deliberately not being ""prescriptive"" about the question that could be posed in another referendum, saying it was ""certainly not ruling out"" the option to stay in the EU.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accepted he would be ""bound"" by the outcome of Tuesday's conference motion.Key delegates - including Sir Keir and leading figures from some trade unions - decided the text at a meeting which lasted several hours on Sunday evening.The final draft for the vote says: ""If we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.""A source told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""There was consensus in the room opposing the Tories' chaotic approach to the Brexit negotiations... and that a general election should be called as soon as any deal is voted down by parliament. ""It was then agreed that if we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.""The Labour Party has never formally rejected the option of a so-called people's vote on Brexit, but both Mr Corbyn and his deputy, Tom Watson, have indicated they would prefer it to be resolved by a general election.By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondentAfter what I am told was six re-drafts and five and a half hours of discussion, wording that could bridge the gap between campaigners for a new referendum and a reluctant leadership was agreed.But what was left out of the conference motion is as important as what went in.The leadership had to agree that wording which restricted a future referendum to ""the terms of Brexit"" had to go.This means that the party could, in theory, back a referendum that gave voters the option of remaining in the EU and not just a vote on the final deal.Campaigners for a new vote see this as significant step forward.But allies of Jeremy Corbyn say the wording doesn't commit him to backing a referendum as it is still only ""an option on the table"" if Theresa May refuses calls for a general election.So still a fudge of sorts - but one with a slightly sweeter taste for supporters of a new vote who firmly believe that ""all options"" will become their option.However, even the hint of a new referendum will allow the Conservatives to claim that Labour weren't serious enough about respecting the previous one.Pressed on the issue on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Corbyn, who has said he is not calling for another referendum, said ""our preference"" is for a general election.He said that would then allow a Labour government to negotiate the UK's future relationship with Europe.""Let's see what comes out of conference. Obviously I'm bound by the democracy of our party,"" he added.Mr Corbyn also told the programme the UK ""could be"" close to a general election. Amid speculation that Labour could force a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Theresa May if Parliament rejects any Brexit deal, he said: ""We will be putting our case to Parliament and we will see what happens after that. We are absolutely ready for it.""He said Labour would be prepared to vote down any deal Mrs May came back with, if it did not meet a series of tests Labour has set out.However, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has ruled out a snap election this autumn, saying the idea was ""for the birds"".The UK is due to leave in March 2019 and Theresa May has been negotiating with other EU leaders on the UK's future relationship with the bloc.Talks hit a stumbling block at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday when EU leaders rejected Mrs May's plan for Brexit - known as the Chequers agreement, and she warned them she was ready to walk away rather than accept a ""bad deal"".For the Lib Dems, who want to stop Brexit, Tom Brake said ""Labour leaders are aiding and abetting Theresa May on Brexit"" and accused them of trying to ""trick and stitch up their own conference"" .He said that any referendum had to include the option of remaining in the EU, because ""the only choice a 'deal or no deal' vote gives people is which foot to point the gun at"".By Newsnight political editor Nick WattThe wrangling has led to much soul searching in the new Labour movement taking shape under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. The Momentum group, established to shore up his leadership at the grassroots, has been torn between pro-European instincts and loyalty to Corbyn.He is heir to the Bennite tradition which regards the founding principles of the EU as anathema to Socialism.Momentum was thinking of taking a neutral position had the motion been difficult for Jeremy Corbyn. One Momentum source told me that, while the organisation is strongly pro-European, it would do nothing to jeopardise its main goal; the election of a truly Socialist government.The People's Vote campaign are reasonably content. They know their greatest weakness in Liverpool is they are seen as a bunch of unreconstructed Blairites seeking to thwart the will of the people on the EU and undermine Corbyn in the bargain.The campaign believe they have shown they have far wider support. They hope to have created a space in November for Labour to be able to endorse a referendum on the grounds that warring Conservative MPs agree on one thing - there must be no general election before 2022.Read more from NickIn a statement on Sunday, the prime minister said ""many in Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are trying to thwart Brexit at every step and seeking to exploit this moment for political gain"" by calling for another referendum and extending Article 50 to delay Brexit.Labour's conference in Liverpool began on Sunday with policy announcements on plans for worker representation on company boards and to make employers provide up to 10 days' paid leave for victims of domestic violence.Announcements on Monday will include: Brexit is among eight issues to have been chosen for debate at the conference in Liverpool after a ballot by Labour members and trade unions.The others are Palestine, the economy, housing, schools, government contracts, in-work poverty and justice for the Windrush generation."
2018-09-23,Labour: We'll make firms give staff shares,https://web.archive.org//web/20180924081729/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45621361,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour would force all large firms to give shares to their workers worth up to Â£500 a year each, John McDonnell will say later.In his main party conference speech, the shadow chancellor will set out planned ""inclusive ownership funds"".Firms would have to put 1% of their shares into the fund every year up to a maximum of 10%.The Confederation of British Industry said Labour's ""diktat"" would ""encourage investors to pack their bags"".But Mr McDonnell told the BBC the UK was lagging way behind countries such as Germany in terms of rates of employee share ownership and it would boost productivity and encourage longer-term corporate decision making.""1% is not particularly radical,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""This is an idea whose time has come but should have come 20 years ago.""""People feel they do not have a stake in society or their communities or their companies and that is one of the reasons we had the Brexit vote.""Since its conference opened in Liverpool on Sunday, Labour has already announced plans for worker representation on company boards and to make employers provide up to 10 days' paid leave for victims of domestic violence.Further announcements are expected to include:The party's power brokers have also agreed on wording for Tuesday's motion on what the party should do about Brexit if it cannot get a general election. It keeps ""all options on the table"" on Brexit, including the possibility of campaigning for a new referendum.In Monday's speech, Mr McDonnell will tell delegates that Labour's inclusive ownership plans would give workers a financial stake in their employers and more say over how companies are run.The amount available to workers would be capped at Â£500, with the rest - estimated at Â£2.1bn a year by the end of a five-year Parliamentary term - going into a fund to pay for public services and welfare.The scheme would apply to companies with more than 250 workers, although smaller firms could set up inclusive ownership funds if they wanted to.Labour calculates that 40% of the UK's private sector workforce - some 10.7 million people - would initially be covered by the scheme. Dividend payouts would be made at a flat rate to all employees of the firm.The funds would be held and managed collectively, with a bar on selling or trading their shareholdings. The system would be similar to that operated by employee-owned retailer John Lewis.But payments from the fund would be made to individual, eligible employees, Labour sources said.Workers' fund representatives would have voting rights in companies' decision-making processes in the same way as other shareholders.Labour aides said the creation of the funds would help redress growing inequalities after a decade when average pay has not increased in real terms.But the dividend payments would not be available to state employees - including workers in industries such as water, which Labour hopes to nationalise.Labour sources say the Â£2bn social dividend fund would ensure public sector workers and employees of smaller firms also benefited from what the party calls a ""broadening of ownership in our economy"".Mr McDonnell will tell Labour delegates in his speech at 12:15 BST: ""Workers, who create the wealth of a company, should share in its ownership and, yes, in the returns that it makes.""We believe it's right that we all share in the benefits that investment produces.""Ahead of the speech, he dismissed claims of an anti-business agenda, telling the BBC that a future Labour government would support the vast majority of ""entrepreneurial and ethical"" British firms to the hilt.But he said those which engaged in aggressive tax avoidance and whose ""standards did not match up to the rest"" could expect a tough response from the government. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, which represents big business in the UK, said Labour was ""wrong to assert that workers will be helped by these proposals in their current form"".She said: ""Their diktat on employee share ownership will only encourage investors to pack their bags and will harm those who can least afford it. If investment falls, so does productivity and pay.""The Conservatives said Labour's proposal was ""yet another tax rise"" that would make it harder for firms to ""take on staff and pay them a good wage""."
2018-09-23,Labour plans to give tenants more power,https://web.archive.org//web/20180924081729/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45621986,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour says it would scrap laws allowing private landlords to evict tenants without giving a reason.The law, in force since 1988, is thought to be the biggest cause of homelessness.Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey announced the policy at the party's conference in Liverpool.Mr Healey also unveiled plans for a Â£20m fund to set up ""renters' unions"" to support tenants in disputes with landlords.So-called ""no-fault"" evictions - when landlords throw people out of their home without saying why - have been growing in recent years.Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research found 80% of private-sector evictions in 2015 fell into this category.Before Section 21 of the 1988 Housing Act came into force it was more difficult for landlords to evict people who paid rent on time.The government has announced plans increase security for tenants in the private rented sector, who now number about 11.5 million people, including minimum tenancies of three years.But Labour says it would go further if it gained power. The party's policies include:In his speech to the Labour faithful in Liverpool, Mr Healey said: ""Tenants who rent from private landlords have been hit hard by the housing crisis.""Labour's commitment is clear: we'll give renters new rights to control rental costs, improve conditions and increase security.""Renters' unions help put power in the hands of tenants.""And the next Labour government will fund set-up costs for these unions across the country to support renters to defend their rights, and make the housing market fairer.""In response, Conservative Housing Secretary James Brokenshire said the costs of a new union for tenants would fall on ""hard-pressed renters""."

But Labour says powers over school admissions and building new schools should be returned to councils.There are about 3,400 secondary schools and 16,700 primary schools in England. Those that are academies are independent, state-funded school and receive their funding directly from central government, rather than through a local authority. Free schools are academies set up by groups of parents, teachers, charities, trusts, religious and voluntary groups. The number of academies and free schools grew dramatically under the coalition government, and has continued under the present Conservative administration.Ministers have argued they help drive up standards through greater innovation and competition in the system.Labour's proposals go further than last year's manifesto which only proposed ending new free schools.Under the party's plans, responsibility for decision-making and budgets could eventually be transferred to a governing body of elected parents, teachers, school staff and community representatives.In her speech, Ms Rayner said the free school and academies schemes ""neither improve standards nor empower staff or parents"".""The Tories have thrown money at an academy and free school programme that is not improving outcomes for pupils, even while individual schools have their budgets cut year after year,"" she said.Labour said it would allow local councils to build new schools and take back control of admissions, adding that it would, during its time in office, ""bring all publically-funded schools back into the public sector with a common rulebook and under local democratic control"".Ms Rayner also said a future Labour government would enforce national pay rules to prevent executives at the chains running free schools paying themselves ""fat cat salaries""."
2018-09-23,Hunt: Don't mistake politeness for weakness,https://web.archive.org//web/20180924081729/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45611738,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has urged the EU not to mistake British politeness for weakness after Brexit negotiations reached an impasse.After rejecting the UK's proposals, Donald Tusk, head of the European Council, posted a provocative picture on Instagram featuring UK PM Theresa May ""cherry-picking"" a cake.Mr Tusk has since said he admires Mrs May, and a compromise is possible.But Mr Hunt said Mr Tusk needed to avoid ""revving up"" the situation.He insisted it was time for people in the EU ""to step back from the abyss"" of a no-deal Brexit, to ""sit down and to talk to us about how we can make these sensible, concrete proposals actually work"".In an interview with Ireland's RTE Radio, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had told him a treaty for the withdrawal of the UK from the EU was 87% agreed.This week, Mrs May tried to sell her proposals for the UK's future relationship with the EU at a summit in Salzburg, Austria.The plan - the so-called Chequers agreement - was agreed by the UK government in July.But EU leaders rejected a major part of her plan, saying the new economic partnership she had put forward would ""not work"" and risked ""undermining the single market"".Mrs May later delivered a televised statement in Downing Street in which she said the EU's rejection of her plan without offering an alternative was ""unacceptable"".She also made it clear she was ready to walk away from the negotiations rather than accept a ""bad deal"".On Saturday, Mr Hunt said the UK was still waiting for a ""detailed response"" from the EU and criticised its approach to negotiations so far.""What Theresa May is saying is 'don't mistake British politeness for weakness',"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""If you put us in a difficult corner, we will stand our ground - that is the kind of country we are.""In a reference to Mr Tusk's Instagram post and French President Emmanuel Macron's comment that Brexit campaigners were liars, Mr Hunt added: ""Insulting her on social media, getting to these stand-offs where you are calling people liars and so on is not the way we are going to get a solution to this difficult situation.""Mr Hunt refused to rule out the prospect that the government could now seek a Canada-style free trade agreement - as many Conservative MPs want, rather than the more ambitious Chequers plan.Canada's deal with the EU, signed in 2016, removes the vast majority of customs duties on EU exports to Canada and Canadian exports to the EU - but without Canada paying for access to the single market.""I am not dismissing anything,"" said Mr Hunt.""We think these proposals are better than the Canada proposals because they work better on the Northern Irish border.""The land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, an EU member, has been a stumbling block in negotiations.Both sides agree they do not want a return to a ""hard border"", such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras, but the wording is proving hard to agree on.The Irish foreign minster also expressed concern about the role of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which is currently propping up Theresa May's Conservative government.The DUP has repeatedly said it would not accept any proposal that meant Northern Ireland would be treated differently to the rest of the United Kingdom.In his RTE interview Simon Coveney said no one party should be allowed to veto proposals on the Northern Ireland border, and that negotiations were turning into a unionist versus nationalist issue.On Friday, Mr Tusk said Britain had known about the EU's reservations over the Chequers plan for weeks.He added that EU leaders at the summit had treated her proposals with ""all seriousness"" and said he was ""convinced that a compromise, good for all, is still possible"".French minister for European affairs Nathalie Loiseau said that, while France still believed a good Brexit deal was possible, it must also prepare for a no-deal outcome.Britain's vote to leave ""cannot lead to the EU going bust"", she said on France Info radio. ""That's the message we have tried to send for several months now to our British counterparts who may have thought we were going to say 'yes' to whatever deal they came up with,"" she said.Please upgrade your browserGerman deputy foreign minister Michael Roth said the EU was striving to achieve ""sensible solutions"". ""The blame game against the EU is therefore more than unfair. We can't solve the problems that are arising on the island,"" he said on Twitter.The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - but the two sides are trying to reach a deal on trade, and other areas of co-operation, by November so it can be ratified in time."

Mr McCluskey told the Huffington Post that Labour's anti-Semitism row was ""not manufactured but has certainly been wildly exaggerated by now"". He suggested Jewish leaders had ""raised entirely proper concerns, but have simply refused to take 'yes' for an answer"".Dame Louise, MP for Liverpool Riverside, said: ""For major trade union leaders to not only smear the Jewish community and Jewish people for speaking out against anti-Semitism but then trying to blame them for it, I think we are entering into very dangerous waters.""They are playing with fire and I call on them to withdraw those appalling statements.""She also told the BBC she ""would have liked Jeremy to speak out against"" Mr McCluskey and Mr Serwotka. Another Labour MP, Wes Streeting, told the rally there were people ""who, through their words and their actions, actively create the conditions in which anti-Semitism can be allowed to fester"".""Yes, Len McCluskey, I'm talking about you describing anti-Semitism as mood music,"" he said.""And yes, Mark Serwotka, I'm telling you as a general secretary with Jewish members that your remarks the other week at the TUC Congress have no place in the Labour Party and no place in the Labour movement.""Dudley MP Mr Austin said it was ""offensive nonsense"" that Labour MPs were complaining about anti-Semitism as a way of undermining Mr Corbyn.He added: ""The truth about Jeremy is that he is much angrier with the people complaining about anti-Semitism than he is with the people responsible for it.""He said Mr Corbyn had to ""stop thinking he is the victim in all of this and he has got to properly explain and apologise for his role and responsibility in the development of this crisis.""Earlier the Labour leader was asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr to express personal remorse for his handling of the anti-Semitism row in a TV interview.He said: ""I am an anti-racist and will die an anti-racist. Anti-Semitism is a scourge in any society and I will oppose it all my life.""He said there had been changes under his leadership to improve the way complaints were dealt with adding: ""The party must be and is a safe and welcoming place for all communities.""The row over claims of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party has been going on for more than two years.  A 2016 inquiry concluded that while the party was not overrun by anti-Semitism, there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"".Over the summer, Mr Corbyn faced criticism after a 2013 video emerged in which he said a group of British Zionists had ""no sense of English irony"". He also came under fire over his presence at a ceremony in Tunisia in 2014, which was said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich terror attack. Earlier in the year, he was criticised for sending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012.  Questioned about the controversy, as the Labour Party conference gets going in Liverpool, Mr Corbyn admitted that the street mural ""shouldn't have been put up"" and he had been ""hasty in my judgement on that"".  On the remarks about a group of British Zionists in 2013, Mr Corbyn said he had been referring to two people at the meeting who had been ""disruptive"" and he had been trying to defend Palestinian ambassador Manuel Hassassian. ""It was not intended to be anti-Semitic in any way ,"" he said. He also defended his appearance at the Tunisia ceremony saying he was there to mark the death of ""civilians and children"" in an Israeli air raid. In September, after a long-running row, Labour adopted in full the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism and its accompanying examples. The party included an extra statement saying this should not undermine free speech on Israel.Mr Corbyn said it was ""right that people should discuss the establishment of the state of Israel but recognise the existence of the state of Israel and not prevent that kind of debate"".

The MEP said of the EU: ""They are a bunch of gangsters. We will explain a free trade deal is possible, if that's what the gangsters in Brussels want.""If they don't, that is fine, if they don't we will leave with no deal. No deal, no problem.""Theresa May's plan for Brexit - known as the Chequers agreement - was rejected by EU leaders as unworkable at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday.Mrs May later said the EU's rejection of her plan without offering an alternative was ""unacceptable"" and made it clear she was ready to walk away from the negotiations rather than accept a ""bad deal"".Mr Farage criticised the Chequers proposals, saying they were ""dead"" and do not work for the EU or the UK.Mr Davis had been leading the UK negotiations to leave the EU but quit the cabinet in July, saying he did not ""believe"" in the Chequers plan.He told Saturday's rally: ""We have nothing to fear and that is the reason why we should only accept a clean and clear Brexit, not some fudge.""Mr Davis also said he viewed the EU's treatment of Mrs May ""with contempt"", adding: ""Bad manners and discourtesy are not the hallmarks of great men.""He continued: ""And if you think you can bully our country, all I can suggest is that you read some history books.""Labour MP Kate Hoey also spoke at the rally, saying: ""We don't need another vote - we just want to leave.""""Our vote matters and we won't allow it to be stolen from us,"" she said.She also said Brussels had never negotiated Brexit in ""good faith"".""They underestimate how strong we are when we are up against it,"" she added.It was a full house at the University of Bolton Stadium. An audience of more than 2,000 people squeezed into what was decked out like a ballroom. A stall selling Leave Means Leave baseball hats did excellent trade.In Bolton, 58% voted to leave the EU in June 2016 and, as they queued to get in, many told how passionate they were to secure the kind of Brexit they voted for. They said they felt the result of the referendum was not being taken seriously enough. The audience had come from around the country, some waved union flags; others wore them.The loudest of the applause was reserved for Nigel Farage who started by saying: ""I didn't think I'd have to do this again."" That got laughs.  Earlier he took an open top bus into Bolton to speak to shoppers and market traders, the media in tow. It all felt a bit like going back to the referendum campaign."
2018-09-23,Labour 'could nationalise rail in five years',https://web.archive.org//web/20180924081729/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45609604,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe rail industry could be completely renationalised within five years if Labour wins the next election, the shadow chancellor has suggested.John McDonnell said he was looking at whether break clauses in contracts could allow rail franchises to be taken into public hands before they expired.He is planning to create a new unit in the Treasury to oversee the party's wider nationalisation plans.It would advise on issues such as possible compensation for shareholders.Mr McDonnell was asked about the party's nationalisation plans in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme ahead of Labour's annual conference in Liverpool.The party's 2017 manifesto included a pledge to bring private rail companies back into public ownership as their franchises expired.However, some franchises are set to continue for many years and the party has said it could use break clauses in contracts to take control sooner. There are currently 18 franchises in England, Scotland and Wales.With the odd exception, the shortest contracts run for seven years, although 10 years is more common.Northern Ireland's rail system has remained nationalised since 1948.The train operating companies are not responsible for track maintenance, which falls to publicly owned Network Rail.Asked whether it was possible all the franchises could be in public hands in the first term of a Labour government Mr McDonnell added: ""I think that's possible. That's why we're working through the detail now of how that can be done. ""And if you look at what's happened over time a number of these franchises have been handed back anyway.""His broader plan is for Labour to establish a Public Ownership Unit to develop legal and financial plans to bring private industries into the state sector, and set out a timetable for action.It would advise on how much compensation shareholders would receive and help decide which Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs) should be nationalised.Labour is keen to present itself as ready for office in the event of an early general election.Mr McDonnell said: ""We will have new structures of government. ""I'll be ready on day one going into government to be able to bring forward the legislation, to implement the policy.""Mr McDonnell argued his plans were cost neutral because the cash generated by newly acquired private companies would cover the cost of financing the debt needed to buy them. There would be enough money left over, he said, to increase investment and reduce consumers' bills.But he declined to say how much extra borrowing would be required to purchase private assets.Shareholders in private companies would receive bonds - government debt - in return for their shares. The new Treasury unit would advise what level of compensation they were due, with the final decision made by Parliament.PFI is a way of financing investment in public infrastructure using private capital. Private firms stump up the cost of building facilities - such as a hospital or school - and, in return, the state makes payments over a period of time - often about 25 years - for their use and management.The model has been attractive to governments of all political persuasions as it limits upfront capital expenditure and reduces risk while future payment obligations do not count towards the national debt. However, its value for money has long been questioned. As of March 2016 there were 716 PFI projects, 686 of which were still operational. The others had either been cancelled or had reached the end of the contract period.The SNP government stopped new PFI contracts when it came to power in Scotland, replacing them with NPDs (non-profit distributing projects).Labour intends to take control of PFIs by nationalising Special Purpose Vehicles - the companies established to run them. Typically, investors would be compensated and Labour would follow legal advice, Mr McDonnell said.But he added: ""There might be some factors in relation to some operations of PFIs in particular that could be brought forward that says actually there is no compensatory arrangements needed here.""The party's annual conference - staged under the slogan ""Rebuilding Britain, for the many, not the few"" - is due to begin in Liverpool on Sunday, with the party pledging to ""put equality centre stage"".It will close on Wednesday with a major speech by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is coming under pressure to back a referendum on the final Brexit deal - he has so far insisted he wants to see a general election instead.Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) is due to meet later on Saturday, the day before the main conference begins, to discuss changes to leadership election rules."

Shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler unveiled the policy at the party's Women's Conference in Liverpool.The proposals aim to give victims time to leave abusive partners safely and seek support. Ms Butler said the policy would save lives and tackle the ""hidden killer"" of domestic abuse. Speaking ahead of the launch of Labour's annual conference on Sunday, Ms Butler told the conference employers had a ""duty of care"" to employees experiencing domestic abuse.""This crucial time will allow women and men to leave their abusive partners safely - get the help, protection and support they need knowing their livelihood is secure.""On average two women a week are murdered by their current or former abusive partner. These 10 days could literally help save the lives of those women.""Similar laws have already been introduced in the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand, she added.Ms Butler also announced plans to set up a new department for Women and Equalities, as part of Labour's pledge to ""put equality centre stage"".""So far we have seen seven different ministers for equality tagged on to four different departments and a budget that's nearly been halved,"" she told the conference. ""This proves the Tories are not taking equalities seriously. By establishing a Department for Women and Equalities, Labour will ensure equalities is the common thread running through its government""The annual Labour conference - staged under the slogan ""Rebuilding Britain, for the many, not the few"" - will start on Sunday, and close on Wednesday with a major speech by Mr Corbyn.The stage is set for fierce debates about Brexit and the future of the party at the Liverpool gathering. Lively debates -yes even divisions - are expected at this year's gathering. Labour's NEC meets tonight to hammer out new leadership rules that are likely to see the influence of MPs watered down in favour of more say for members and the unions. And tomorrow behind the scenes there will be wrangles over how to boil down 125 Brexit motions to just two or three - with some members wanting to push the leadership further than it wants to go in calling for a new referendum on the EU.But it's often the unanticipated divisions that can cause the bigger problem. Dawn Butler not only praised the 1980s Militant-led Liverpool council in her speech to the women's conference today - but she also suggested it was better to break the law than break the poor. Some in the party are furious that she has gifted the Conservatives a weapon of attack. Party policy is for councillors to set legal budgets - but Labour's opponents can now question its sincerity. "
2018-09-23,Brexit: What happens next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180924081729/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45601502,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has warned that the Brexit negotiations are at an impasse and there will be no progress until the EU treats her proposals seriously.She has accused EU leaders of showing the UK a lack of respect after they rebuffed her Chequers plan without, she said, any alternative or explanation. With the clock counting down to the UK's scheduled exit on 29 March 2019, where does this latest row leave the chances of a deal and what could happen next in the Brexit process?Thursday's gathering of European leaders in Salzburg was supposed to help bridge outstanding differences and pave the way for a potential deal by the middle of November at the latest.But instead, it has driven a wedge between the UK and the EU, with accusations of bad faith and ""un-statesmanlike"" behaviour.Mrs May has said the two sides remain ""a long way"" apart on the crucial issues of how the UK will trade with the EU after Brexit and the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.She reiterated again her belief that her Chequers blueprint was the only way of properly implementing Brexit and also ensuring a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU in the future. Please upgrade your browserThe PM, visibly angered by the reception she got from her fellow leaders in Austria, also rejected the two options put on the table by the EU - a Norway-style association agreement and a much looser relationship based on Canada's trade deal with the EU. For its part, the EU has said the Chequers plan is unworkable as it fragments the single market. The next few weeks will be crucial if these differences are to be resolved and the two sides are to fulfil their shared aim of an orderly Brexit and an outline agreement on trade, security and other issues. Mrs May has suffered plenty of Brexit setbacks in the past and soldiered on and it looks like she is determined to do so again.The only problem is that many of her own MPs don't think she is going about the process of leaving the EU the right way.The number of Tories who say they won't vote for the Chequers plan seems to be growing by the day and, remember, any deal she negotiates with the EU has to get through Parliament.There is enormous pressure from the Brexiteer-wing of the party for her to rip up Chequers and throw her weight behind a turbo-charged version of Canada's deal with the EU.The so-called Canada Plus Plus option, which removes most customs duties on goods but without paying for access to the single market, is backed by Boris Johnson, David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg, among others, who believe the UK Parliament will vote for it.Many Conservative Remainers, like former minister Justine Greening, have also lost faith in Chequers and think there should be a referendum (more of that later) while some Tories think the UK may well end up in a temporary European Economic Area-style arrangement, sometimes called the Norway option. This would mean accepting the free movement of people and the indirect recognition of European Court of Justice rulings - but would allow businesses access to the EU single market, with some strings attached.Amid speculation about further cabinet resignations if she persists with Chequers, calls for the PM to think again are likely to reach a crescendo at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham.If the PM does not shift on the substance of her Chequers plan, expect much frenzied talk of leadership challenges.Salzburg may have caused a dust-up but it hasn't changed the underlying reality that both sides want as amicable a divorce as possible.Some Tory MPs favour a clean break with the EU, which would see the UK fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization, the global body governing international trade, but they are in a minority.Both sides are ramping up talk of no-deal contingency planning.But they also know that such an outcome would be seen as a political failure and a disaster for business - particularly as the 21-month transition period planned after Brexit day would be scrapped.A summit on 18-19 October of EU leaders was, for a long time, pencilled in as the moment that the two sides would have to look each other in the eye and reach a deal.However, this is not now seen as feasible and the focus is on a special one-off summit that has been arranged for mid-November.An agreement then, the thinking goes, would still allow enough time for the UK and European Parliaments and a supermajority of European states - that's 20 out of 27 - to ratify any deal before the 29 March deadline.So, the clock is ticking but the EU is renowned for finalising deals at the 11th hour and it wouldn't be the first time the talks have seemed on the brink of collapse only for a deal to be pulled out of the fire. If she brings a deal back from Brussels, Theresa May has another big hurdle to negotiate. She must persuade Parliament to back it, in a vote likely before the end of the year or in early 2019.Tory Brexiteers opposed to Chequers have suggested up to 80 MPs would be prepared to vote against it. Although we don't know what the final deal will look like and the size of any rebellion would, in all likelihood, be much smaller, even a dozen Conservatives defying the leadership would risk defeat for the PM, with her non-existent Commons majority.The opposition parties are unlikely to come to the PM's aid, with Labour saying any deal is unlikely to pass its six tests guaranteeing workers' rights and all the ""benefits"" of the single market and customs union.The Labour leadership is hoping to inflict a defeat as a way of triggering a general election.It is written into law that the UK will be leaving at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019, two years to the day after the government notified the EU of its intention to quit, by triggering Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty. But if there is no deal or Parliament rejects the deal, we are in uncharted territory and it is impossible to say with any certainty what will happen next.Mrs May has insisted the 2016 referendum result will not be overturned but if Parliament cannot agree on what kind of Brexit it wants, a fresh public vote might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. There are a growing number of people who believe this is the case, although they are largely confined to people who voted Remain in 2016 and they can't all agree on what question should be asked on the ballot paper.The Liberal Democrats and the cross-party People's Vote campaign, backed by about 30 Labour MPs, five Conservatives, the four Plaid Cymru MPs and Green MP Caroline Lucas, wants the option to stay in the EU to be put before voters.Critics say there won't be enough time for another referendum - and Mrs May has explicitly ruled out extending the two-year Article 50 process, amid reports EU leaders might be open to that.However, and it is a big however, should Mrs May resign in the event of her deal being rejected, her successor would have a new mandate. Some European leaders believe Brexit can be halted but, in the absence of a referendum, the only other way this could conceivably happen is if there were a general election before 29 March next year. A new government with a majority would have the power to delay or reverse the process but whether it would have the desire - given Labour's policy so far has been to respect the Brexit vote - is another matter entirely.If the UK does leave as planned, it is far from the end of the story. It is only then that discussions about future co-operation - including a trade deal - will really begin in earnest. "
2018-09-23,"UKIP aiming to be 'radical, populist' party",https://web.archive.org//web/20180924081729/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45593648,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowUKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", says its leader.Its ""interim manifesto"", unveiled on the eve of its conference, also urges a ""clean exit"" from the EU.Leader Gerard Batten said the policies unveiled aimed to help ""the people who form the backbone of Britain"".He is the fourth person to lead UKIP since Nigel Farage quit in the wake of the 2016 EU Referendum.The party has also suffered a funding crisis and was saved from insolvency by public donations.Under Mr Batten's leadership, membership has increased from a low of around 18,000 to approximately 24,000, according to UKIP, but critics have accused the party of becoming too right-wing.BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said UKIP has allowed controversial online video bloggers, to join the party and is considering whether to allow the former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson to become a member.Sargon of Akkad and Count Dankula, self-styled You Tube activists and free speech campaigners, will be among those addressing Friday's conference in Birmingham.Aside from Mr Batten, other speakers will include Neil Hamilton, who was ousted earlier this year as leader of the UKIP group in the Welsh Assembly. The party's interim manifesto includes sections on free speech, political correctness and Islamic extremism, as well as the NHS, defence, education and policing among others.It urges a ""complete and total withdrawal from the European Union"", and says UKIP will keep fighting to make the UK an ""independent, self-governing, sovereign state"", regardless of any Brexit deal reached. In it, Mr Batten says UKIP will ""promote and defend our national and individual freedoms"" adding: ""We are determined to protect our freedom of speech and the right to speak our minds without fear of the politically correct thought-police knocking on our doors.""The manifesto covers a wide range of policy areas, from the NHS and transport to fisheries and small businesses, with policies including: Mr Batten, who took over as leader in February but has said he intends to resign after a year, said: ""These policies are aimed at helping the people who form the backbone of Britain: ordinary workers and taxpayers, the unemployed who would like to work, and small and medium-sized business owners.""""Its purpose is to make UKIP a populist party in the real meaning of the word - one whose policies are popular with voters.""The UKIP leader has hit back at claims of growing links between the party and far-right groups, telling Sky News he was ""entitled to speak at rallies organised by people who believe in democracy"". Mr Batten said Tommy Robinson would not be admitted to UKIP ""in the near future"" because it would require changes to the party's rules.But Mr Farage, who has returned to the domestic political fray with a campaign to ""save Brexit"", said UKIP risked ""total and utter marginalisation"" unless it changed direction.He told the Press Association he was ""totally opposed"" to allowing Mr Robinson into the party. ""I wrote very explicitly into the rules of the party when I first became leader: we did not want anybody in the party that had taints with organisations we deemed to be on the far right of British politics,"" he said.""It really upsets me to see the fact this debate is even taking place.""UKIP, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, saw its popularity collapse in the 2017 election after securing only 594,068 votes - down from 3,881,099 in 2015.The party leadership has changed hands six times since the 2016 EU referendum, with Mr Farage returning temporarily when his successor Diane James quit after less than a month at the helm. Paul Nuttall succeeded her in November 2016 but quit following the 2017 general election - and Steve Crowther became acting leader. Henry Bolton was elected leader in September 2017 but was ousted following controversy over racist messages sent by his partner. "

Indeed, the Unite leader Len McCluskey had to emphasise just how easy it would be, in order to assuage angry delegates. However, a third of union or local party branches will have to agree to pull the trigger on the starting gun for any contest. It won't be automatic.But what upset many left wing delegates was what they saw as an old fashioned stitch-up worthy of the Blair era.They were given a straight choice between accepting or rejecting the NEC compromise - and no opportunity to vote for open selections.That's why they very nearly threw out the whole conference agenda in protest.Which brings us to the second point: the row tells us that there are now far more delegates on the left of the party than in previous years, even after Jeremy Corbyn became leader.This is underlined by the fact that while the Momentum leadership is now backing the deselection compromise as a step forward, some of their own supporters see this as a sell out. Nonetheless, Momentum will come together again to harry for further change in the years ahead.And in doing so, the friction between the political and industrial wings of this new-look Labour is likely to increase."
2018-09-23,Referendum shift?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180924081729/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45616467,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTwo significant shifts have happened on the eve of Labour conferenceâ¦ and they both involve the party's deputy leader.So far the party's deputy Tom Watson has stuck to the official line that a new referendum shouldn't be ""off the table"" - but that a general election is preferable.While not technically departing from that formulation, he is sounding far warmer to the idea of a new referendum now that a YouGov poll of Labour party members - commissioned by the People's Vote campaign - has suggested that 86% would back one.He told the Observer newspaper that while he would prefer Brexit to be debated in an election soon, the members' views must be respected. ""Jeremy and I were elected in 2015 to give the Labour party back to its members,"" he said. ""So if the people's party decide they want the people to have a final say on the deal, we have to respect the view of our members and we will go out and argue for it. That is what happens when you return the party to the members.""Mr Watson also suggested that if there were an early election then there would be pressure to make a referendum a manifesto commitment. His views are important because - like Jeremy Corbyn - he has a mandate from the membership.But the significance of another development should not be understated.At Saturday night's meeting, Labour's ruling National Executive Committee has decided to recommend the creation of an additional deputy leadership post.Mr Watson supported the idea of being joined in the leadership team by a female deputy, as did many of the trade union members of the NEC. Jeremy Corbyn, as I understand it, wasn't in the meeting when the decision was taken but was at a party rally.But the timing of the election of the new deputy could be highly significant.If the full conference backs the creation of the new post, the NEC will draw up the timetable for the election.And if it is sooner rather than later, that raises the prospect of a candidate standing on a platform of a new EU referendum. If they get that mandate, the pressure on the existing leadership to change position could reach boiling point."

2018-09-23,The view from Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20180924081729/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45591733,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThere's a distinct tone of concern in European newspapers over Prime Minister Theresa May's proposal for future trading ties with the EU.But many papers fear the consequences of a no-deal hard Brexit even more.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte sees Brexit as one of the biggest threats to the economic prosperity of the Netherlands, Algemeen Dagblad says. ""Brexit will have consequences for the Netherlands no matter what"" and ""everything must be done"" to prevent a no-deal Brexit, it quotes him as saying. The Netherlands has a greater interest in a ""decent deal"" than other EU countries, given the Dutch economy's reliance on exports, the daily says. ""Brexit is threatening our exports, our jobs, and our wallets,"" De Telegraaf quotes Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra as saying. Mr Hoekstra lists Brexit as one of the risks to Dutch economic growth, alongside geopolitical instability and trade conflicts, the daily notes. ""The Dutch government is preparing for chaos and problems"" when the UK leaves the EU, broadcaster RTL observes. Belgium's De Standaard quotes Economy Minister Kris Peeters as saying that a no-deal hard Brexit ""remains a very realistic option for now"". The paper notes that much is at stake for Belgium since 10% of its exports go to the UK, accounting for 40,000 dependent jobs.In Slovakia, Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Frantisek Ruzicka says a hard Brexit would have a ""direct impact on Slovak citizens living in the UK, trade, and services"", Teraz.sk website reports. Mr Ruzicka says Slovakia hopes the UK will be able to negotiate a political deal with the EU.  Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said at the EU summit on Brexit in Salzburg that ""we really care about ending the impasse between the UK and Europe"" and he called for stability for Polish citizens and businesses in the UK. Mr Morawiecki acknowledged that the negotiations had been nerve-racking, according to Gazeta Prawna.""In Austria, the 27 should understand that the Irish issue is the only difficulty on the way to making an agreement,"" France's Le Monde states. It notes that Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is pursuing a strategy of ""de-dramatisation"", showing a ""willingness to compromise"" on the backstop proposal for the Irish border. At the same time, European leaders are preparing to limit the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, the daily says. After all, London is pursuing ""intense lobbying to try to divide the Continental front"".Salzburg could be an ""occasion to start off on the right foot again"" after a ""summer of continued crises"" - but ""this will not be the case"", France's Le Figaro believes.  Theresa May is ""one of the few adults"" among the ""big kids of London"", Germany's centre-left Spiegel says. And this is why politicians are inclined to be friendly to her.But Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung notes that Brussels does not want to make any move before the UK Conservative Party conference. ""The fear is too great that any type of constructive proposal at Salzburg will be taken down by the Brexiteers.""  ""The passivity with which above all Angela Merkel is letting Brexit make its way bureaucratically is short-sighted,"" political editor for Die Zeit, Jochen Bittner, argues. It is precisely on the matter of sovereign borders that ""Europe could accommodate Britain with the concession that a little more control would not in any way destroy Europe's union thinking"", Bittner says. ""There are already possibilities"" for a cap on immigration within the EU, ""a kind of emergency brake"", which could be an ""insurance against that fear of overloading that made many Britons vote to leave"", he says.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

2018-09-23,Rule changes,https://web.archive.org//web/20180924081729/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45562446,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour's executive is currently meeting behind closed doors - to discuss ways of making the party more democratic.But some members are unhappy with what they see as a possible power grab by some of the big unions who control 50% of votes at next week's conference.Discussions will focus on what changes are needed to the party's rules in order to implement proposals from the year-long democracy review.The conference will then vote to approve or reject them.There is a left-wing, pro-Corbyn majority on the National Executive Committee (NEC) but some issues have proved divisive even within the left.Momentum - the group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership - has been pushing for 'open' parliamentary selections.This would allow parliamentary hopefuls to compete against any sitting MP between general elections for any Labour nomination.But some unions - also under left-wing control - believe this would diminish their role in the process of choosing MPs.So I am told a compromise is being brokered.Currently for a sitting MP to be challenged, 50% of their local party branches have to agree - and that includes not just branches consisting of individual party members, but branches  of 'affiliated' trade unions, too.In other words, those unions that pay for a link to the Labour Party such as Unite and the GMB.Under the compromise plan, a contest would be triggered if just 30% of union or party branches agree.So the existing system of selections would be reformed rather than swept away.There has, however, been a further wrangle over the compromise. The democracy review was sold as a way of empowering the membership and some on the left are fearful that it will instead further empower trade union leaders.Some local trade union branches have very few members while many of the branches consisting of fully-paid up individual party members are much larger.So a relatively small number of trade unionists could trigger a re-selection contest since it would be much easier to get 30% of trade union branches to give the sitting MP the thumbs down than 30% of the (often much larger) membership branches.There had been talk of a further compromise - giving less weight to smaller union branches.On the latest information I have, it looks like this further proposal may have been dropped.One NEC member suggested privately that the ""compromise"" - rather than either protecting sitting MPs or giving members a much greater say -  would in effect allow Unite chief Len McCluskey ""to pick off whoever he wants"".So even the ""compromise"" hasn't been agreed.Not knowingly undersold, one insider said ""it could be war"".There has also been a change to the initial proposal for selecting Jeremy Corbyn's eventual successor. What was floated at the last meeting of the NEC was a new system which would allow a candidate to get nominated with the backing of just 5% of MPs (the current threshold is 10%) so long as either 10% of local constituency parties, or 10% of unions, also nominated them.Today the NEC will discuss a new proposal - a future leader would require not only the support of 10% of MPs and local parties but would now also require the support of two trade unions that account for 5% of 'affiliated' members.Complicated as that is (and believe it or not, I have simplified the options) the upshot is that a leadership candidate wouldn't get on the ballot without the backing of some big unions.And some Momentum activists are complaining that this would skew power away from rank and file party members and are pledging to oppose it.Momentum has been pressing its members to deluge the NEC with emails calling for the leadership threshold to be reduced to 5% of MPs and for any compromise on parliamentary selections to be ditched.""Their phones are imploding under the weight of emails,"" one source said.The NEC is likely to be expanded to include, specifically, party members with disabilities and those from an ethnic minority  background. But the proposal today is that these new places will be elected equally by unions and rank-and-file members, not just by the party membership alone.After the last NEC meeting, a Corbyn-sceptic told me he had ""kicked into the long grass"" a proposal that the leaders of local authority Labour groups would be elected by the wider membership and not just by councils.Well, someone has got the political lawnmower out, because it's back on the agenda now.And local government manifestos might be drawn up not by councillors but wider local government committees which include trade union nominees.Under the current system when an NEC place chosen by the members (the unions, councillors, shadow cabinet and MPs/MEPs have their own dedicated places) becomes vacant, the runner up in the annual elections is automatically promoted onto the NEC.I understand an NEC member is considering standing down and that would mean comedian Eddie Izzard (who wasn't supported by the left) would be elevated. But under proposals to be discussed today a by-election, seen as unnecessarily expensive by opponents, would be held in future - increasing the chance of a left-wing replacementA proposal to have existing NEC members choose amongst themselves who joins them has been dropped.Clearly there are plenty of issues still to be agreed, but whatever backroom deals are done, or compromises concluded, it's likely by the end of Labour conference that it will be easier to replace sitting MPs and that it's even more likely that someone on the left (not necessarily the so-called 'hard left') will replace Jeremy Corbyn when the time comes.And that the tension between a vision of a ""members-led"" party which Momentum has been advocating, and one where the big trade unions retain power, will continue."
2018-09-23,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180924081729/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK but talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan, which was the UK's official view of a proposed Brexit deal.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May held an awayday for the cabinet at her country residence - Chequers - in July. At this gathering a favoured UK position for Brexit talks was agreed. It included proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals and says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland.

The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-23,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180924081729/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said: ""Ending freedom of movement as it stands has become a rhetorical non-negotiable for Theresa May.""But Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons Brexit select committee, said the move was a mistake.""It would have been sensible to give preference to EU citizens given the close relationship we want to have,"" he told a fringe meeting at the party's conference in Liverpool. The cabinet agreement came after a presentation from the MAC chairman, Prof Alan Manning, at a lengthy meeting on Monday.According to one source, the principle was agreed that the UK would not show bias towards immigrants from any one part of the world over another when granting access to work.However, one cabinet source told the BBC the agreement did not constitute a firm decision and a government source said there could be ""light touch migration"" rules for EU nationals as part of any wider Brexit trade deal.The government does not call this ""preferential"" treatment because a similar arrangement  could be struck with, for example, the US as part of a UK-US trade deal.The EU's principle of freedom of movement currently allows people from the European Economic Area - all EU countries, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - plus Switzerland, to travel and work within the area without visas, regardless of skills.Anyone wanting to move to the UK from outside the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, to work or study needs to apply for one of a number of visas.These range from Tier 1, preserved for investors and ""exceptional talent"", to Tier 5 visas for short-term voluntary and educational programmes.The two most common are the Tier 2 skilled worker visas and Tier 4 student visas. Currently, no Tier 3 - unskilled labour - visas are being given out.Some of these visas allow people to apply to bring dependants such as children and partners.Visas work on a points-based system and the criteria have got tougher in recent years.For example, for a Tier 2 ""experienced skilled worker"" visa, people now need to be paid at least Â£30,000 to apply, up almost Â£10,000 from 2011. People get more points for higher salaries or if their job is on the list of shortage occupations.Most visas come with other conditions, including knowledge of English, the need for a sponsor and agreeing not to claim benefits for a period of time.The UK is due to withdraw from the European Union on 29 March next year, although an ""implementation period"" lasting until 31 December 2020 has been agreed as part of the proposed Brexit deal being negotiated between the UK and the EU.In that transition period, EU citizens arriving in the UK would enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive beforehand. The same would apply to UK expats on the continent.It remains unclear what would happen in the event of a ""no-deal"" Brexit, as the transition period would not then happen and the new migration system would, government sources say, have to be ""tapered in"" because it would not be ready by March.Please upgrade your browserLast week, the Migration Advisory Committee, an independent public body which advises ministers on migration issues, called for the annual limit on the number of high-skilled workers from outside the EU granted permission to work to be scrapped.Currently set at 20,700 a year, the cap - imposed by Mrs May when at the Home Office - has resulted in thousands of IT specialists and NHS candidates being denied visas.A change in the rules for NHS workers was announced in June after pressure from health bosses.Lobby groups such as the Campaign for Science and Engineering have argued that job offers in other areas, such as science and engineering, should also be exempt from the rules.Home Secretary Sajid Javid has previously said he was taking a ""fresh look"" at the Tier 2 cap.Some business groups, particularly in industries such as agriculture and hospitality, have warned that any future arrangement barring low-skilled migrants could cause disruption.It is understood that at Monday's cabinet meeting Business Secretary Greg Clark raised the concerns of businesses at a sudden change, arguing that there could be pressure for a gradual, rather than immediate shake up after Brexit. The Chancellor Philip Hammond agreed that was likely but sources say there was a unanimous decision to move to a new system based on the principle of equal access, albeit with the acceptance that some sectors would need low skilled migrants from the EU.

""That includes campaigning for a public vote,"" he said.""It is right for Parliament to have the first say but if we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option.""Please upgrade your browserMonday saw confusion over whether the leadership thought any fresh referendum should include staying in the EU as an option.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he thought any vote should be on the terms of a Brexit deal - rather than on remaining in the EU.But he later said ""all options"" were on the table - a point reinforced by Sir Keir.Labour - which wants the UK to remain in a customs union but not the single market - has not ruled out voting for any deal Mrs May brings back from Brussels, ahead of the UK's 29 March departure date. But Sir Keir said the six tests his party has set - including guarantees on workers' rights and retaining the economic benefits of existing market arrangements - were unlikely to be met.""Some have said Labour could vote for any deal the Tories reach. Some have said we may abstain. Some have said we may vote for a vague deal,"" he said.""So, let me be very clear - right here, right now: if Theresa May brings back a deal that does not meet our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts. ""And if the prime minister thinks we'll wave through a vague deal asking us to leap blindfolded into the unknown, she can think again.""But Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said any vote on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations could not be a re-run of the 2016 in-out referendum.""Despite what Keir said earlier, it's a public vote on the terms of our departure,"" he said. ""We desperately need a better, fairer society - we need to heal the wounds of Brexit, not reopen them, and only our movement, united with a proud socialist government, is capable of doing that.""The Labour Leave campaign group, which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum, said Sir Keir was ""playing with fire"" and talk of a referendum made Labour look like ""the party of Remain"". ""We're damaging the Labour brand and alienating our supporters,"" said its general secretary Brendan Chilton.""We have already had a vote on the UK's membership of the EU; it's been done and dusted. The Labour Party and its members must accept this and move on.""The prime minister's Chequers plan, which would see the UK staying closely aligned to the EU in some areas, such as the trade in goods, has been criticised by EU leaders and many of her own MPs.The Conservatives accused Labour of ""playing political games"".""Labour seem determined to take us all back to square one by rejecting a deal out of hand then trying to delay Brexit and re-run the referendum,"" said Brexit minister Robin Walker.

2018-09-24,Flights 'at risk' under no-deal Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925084922/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45626881,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA no-deal Brexit could cause disruption to air travel between the UK and European Union countries, the government warned on Monday.This worst-case scenario is set out in the latest batch of documents outlining what what would happen to key industries if no agreement is reached.Bus and coach services to EU countries could also be suspended in the event of no deal.The government wants the EU and UK to accept each other's aviation standards.However, the EU has not yet done so and will stop recognising UK safety standards if there is a hard Brexit.""If the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 with no agreement in place, UK and EU licensed airlines would lose the automatic right to operate air services between the UK and the EU without seeking advance permission,"" the government said. The UK ""would envisage"" allowing EU airlines to continue flying and ""we would expect EU countries to reciprocate in turn"", according to the document.It added: ""It would not be in the interest of any EU country or the UK to restrict the choice of destinations that could be served, though if such permissions are not granted, there could be disruption to some flights.""The warning does not necessarily mean that flights would be grounded the day after Brexit.According to Airlines UK, which represents 13 UK-registered carriers, the European Commission has said it would put in place a ""bare bones"" aviation agreement with the UK to keep planes flying and to cover safety issues.Tim Alderslade, the trade body's chief executive, said airlines expected the EU and UK to reach a new agreement on aviation. ""Whilst we don't support a no-deal Brexit, we welcome that both the UK and the EU are proposing in this event a minimum agreement that would cover flight and safety requirements for the benefit of both passenger and cargo services,"" he said.ADS Group, which represents the UK's aerospace, defence, security and space sectors, has called for Britain to remain a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).It said talks should be held between the Civil Aviation Authority and the EASA to address the complex issues involved and ensure flights are not disrupted.The no deal notices the government published this afternoon will make uncomfortable reading for many businesses and consumers, but also for the government.In dry, technical language they make clear that many aspects of day-to-day life could be affected significantly if the UK leaves the EU with no deal at all, including air and coach travel (which could in theory come to a temporary halt) food labelling, driving in Europe for business or pleasure, and taking your pet across the Channel.The government argues that these warnings represent contingency planning for a worst case scenario, but until they can guarantee that a deal will be done, preparations will have to be made.And with time running out, people will have to start acting on some of the advice as soon as November. The prospect of a no deal Brexit is beginning to loom large.Flights between the UK and 17 non-EU countries, such as the US, Canada, Switzerland and Iceland, operate due to the UK being an EU member.The guidance states that ""replacement arrangements will be in place before exit day"".The UK has already reached agreements with some of these countries and is ""confident the remaining agreements will be agreed well in advance of the UK leaving the EU"", the government said.A separate government document warned that UK passengers may have to undergo extra security screening when changing flights in the EU after Brexit.Neither passengers nor their luggage are usually rescanned when connecting at other EU airports after flying from the UK.However, new advice states that could change if the EU failed to recognise the UK's aviation security standards after Brexit."

Mr Corbyn, then a backbench MP, addressed the crowds in Hyde Park.""In my view, Jeremy Corbyn stands on the threshold of Downing Street today because he stood on that stage in 2003 and spoke for the millions of all of us who wanted an agenda of peace and justice - not neo-Conservative war - and we are now within touching distance of that agenda coming to fruition,"" said Mr Murray.The trade union official, a former communist, was last week mocked by Labour's deputy leader for suggesting the ""deep state"" was against him.The packed Stop the War fringe meeting was also addressed by shadow cabinet members Richard Burgon and Diane Abbott, as well as leading Corbyn-supporting MP Chris Williamson, among others.Mr Burgon accused some of the party's MPs of being ""unwavering and very vocal advocates of bombing"".Ms Abbott said Mr Corbyn's ""internationalist"" policy agenda was just as important as his domestic one - and ""Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10"" would not just make people richer it would make them ""safer by being a force for peace""."
2018-09-24,Labour: We'll make firms give staff shares,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925084922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45621361,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour would force all large firms to give workers shares worth up to Â£500 a year each, John McDonnell has said.In his main party conference speech, the shadow chancellor set out plans for ""inclusive ownership funds"".He also announced that the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour.Existing bosses would be fired and control handed to workers, local councils and customers, with new executives hired on reduced salaries. He told Labour delegates: ""There will be unprecedented openness and transparency in how the industry will be managed. ""We are ending the profiteering in dividends, vast executive salaries, and excessive interest payments. ""Surpluses will be reinvested in water infrastructure and staff, or used to reduce bills. Real investment will allow the highest environmental standards.""Ownership of the existing water and sewerage companies would be transferred to new Regional Water Authorities, with day-to-day operational management in the hands of professional management and the wider workforce.Existing shareholders would be compensated with bonds and all staff would be transferred to the same jobs, ""except for senior executives and directors, whose posts will be re-advertised on dramatically reduced salaries capped by our 20:1 pay ratio policy"", Labour sources said.The new authorities would be self-financing, along similar lines to Transport for London, which manages the London Underground, rail and bus services.Labour also plans to nationalise the railways, energy and mail industries.Mr McDonnell also announced:Plans to give workers in private industry more of a say - and a financial stake - in industry are a key plank of Labour's industrial strategy. Since its conference opened in Liverpool on Sunday, Labour has already announced plans for worker representation on company boards and to make employers provide up to 10 days' paid leave for victims of domestic violence.Under Labour's ""inclusive ownership fund"" proposal, Mr McDonnell said workers would be given a financial stake in their employers and more say over how companies are run.Firms would have to put 1% of their shares into the fund every year up to a maximum of 10%.The amount of share capital available to workers would be capped at Â£500, with the rest - estimated at Â£2.1bn a year by the end of a five-year Parliamentary term - going into a fund to pay for public services and welfare.The scheme would apply to companies with more than 250 workers, although smaller firms could set up inclusive ownership funds if they wanted to.Labour calculates that 40% of the UK's private sector workforce - some 10.7 million people - would initially be covered by the scheme. Dividend payouts would be made at a flat rate to all employees of the firm.The funds would be held and managed collectively, with a bar on selling or trading their shareholdings. The system would be similar to that operated by employee-owned retailer John Lewis.But payments from the fund would be made to individual, eligible employees, Labour sources said.Workers' fund representatives would have voting rights in companies' decision-making processes in the same way as other shareholders.Labour aides said the creation of the funds would help redress growing inequalities after a decade when average pay has not increased in real terms.But the dividend payments would not be available to state employees - including workers in industries such as water, which Labour hopes to nationalise.Labour sources say the Â£2bn social dividend fund would ensure public sector workers and employees of smaller firms also benefited from what the party calls a ""broadening of ownership in our economy"".By BBC business editor Simon JackMany companies offer incentives and discounts to employees who wish to build a shareholding over time. That is not the same as taking 10% of the company away from its current owners to stick in a fund for the workers and the government's benefit, which seems to be what the shadow chancellor is proposing.For a start, the workers will not be able to buy and sell the shares - so they won't really ""own"" them in a traditional sense. They will be eligible to receive dividends on the shares up to a value of Â£500 per worker per year. The government gets the rest.The Labour Party reckons this will raise about Â£2bn a year. It could end up much more. Let's take just one company - bumper dividend-payer Shell. Ten percent of its Â£12bn annual dividend comes to Â£1.2bn.If each of its 6,500 UK employees got Â£500 each (totalling Â£3.25m) that leaves Â£1.116bn for the government. That's just from one company - every year. Wow.Read more: Can Labour's shares giveaway work?Mr McDonnell told Labour delegates: ""Workers, who create the wealth of a company, should share in its ownership and, yes, in the returns that it makes.""We believe it's right that we all share in the benefits that investment produces.""Ahead of the speech, he dismissed claims of an anti-business agenda, telling the BBC that a future Labour government would support the vast majority of ""entrepreneurial and ethical"" British firms to the hilt.But he said those which engaged in aggressive tax avoidance and whose ""standards did not match up to the rest"" could expect a tough response from the government. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, which represents big business in the UK, said Labour was ""wrong to assert that workers will be helped by these proposals in their current form"".She said: ""Their diktat on employee share ownership will only encourage investors to pack their bags and will harm those who can least afford it. If investment falls, so does productivity and pay.""The Conservatives said Labour's proposal was ""yet another tax rise"" that would make it harder for firms to ""take on staff and pay them a good wage""."
2018-09-24,Starmer insists Labour 'clear' on EU vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925084922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45622161,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour members are to vote on keeping ""all options on the table"" on Brexit, including possibly campaigning for a new referendum, at their conference.The party's leadership wants a general election allowing Labour to take control of negotiations if it won.However some members want the party to pursue a ""people's vote"" on Brexit.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC he thought any such vote should be on the terms of a Brexit deal rather than an option to stay in the EU.He said that Labour would continue to respect the 2016 referendum, in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union.And he said a general election was needed so a Labour government could strike a Brexit deal with the EU which ""brings the country together"".But shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC the party was deliberately not being ""prescriptive"" about the question that could be posed in another referendum, saying it was ""certainly not ruling out"" the option to stay in the EU.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accepted he would be ""bound"" by the outcome of Tuesday's conference motion.Key delegates - including Sir Keir and leading figures from some trade unions - decided the text at a meeting which lasted several hours on Sunday evening.The final draft for the vote says: ""If we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.""A source told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""There was consensus in the room opposing the Tories' chaotic approach to the Brexit negotiations... and that a general election should be called as soon as any deal is voted down by parliament. ""It was then agreed that if we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.""The Labour Party has never formally rejected the option of a so-called people's vote on Brexit, but both Mr Corbyn and his deputy, Tom Watson, have indicated they would prefer it to be resolved by a general election.By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondentAfter what I am told was six re-drafts and five and a half hours of discussion, wording that could bridge the gap between campaigners for a new referendum and a reluctant leadership was agreed.But what was left out of the conference motion is as important as what went in.The leadership had to agree that wording which restricted a future referendum to ""the terms of Brexit"" had to go.This means that the party could, in theory, back a referendum that gave voters the option of remaining in the EU and not just a vote on the final deal.Campaigners for a new vote see this as significant step forward.But allies of Jeremy Corbyn say the wording doesn't commit him to backing a referendum as it is still only ""an option on the table"" if Theresa May refuses calls for a general election.So still a fudge of sorts - but one with a slightly sweeter taste for supporters of a new vote who firmly believe that ""all options"" will become their option.However, even the hint of a new referendum will allow the Conservatives to claim that Labour weren't serious enough about respecting the previous one.Pressed on the issue on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Corbyn, who has said he is not calling for another referendum, said ""our preference"" is for a general election.He said that would then allow a Labour government to negotiate the UK's future relationship with Europe.""Let's see what comes out of conference. Obviously I'm bound by the democracy of our party,"" he added.Mr Corbyn also told the programme the UK ""could be"" close to a general election. Amid speculation that Labour could force a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Theresa May if Parliament rejects any Brexit deal, he said: ""We will be putting our case to Parliament and we will see what happens after that. We are absolutely ready for it.""He said Labour would be prepared to vote down any deal Mrs May came back with, if it did not meet a series of tests Labour has set out.However, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has ruled out a snap election this autumn, saying the idea was ""for the birds"".The UK is due to leave in March 2019 and Theresa May has been negotiating with other EU leaders on the UK's future relationship with the bloc.Talks hit a stumbling block at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday when EU leaders rejected Mrs May's plan for Brexit - known as the Chequers agreement, and she warned them she was ready to walk away rather than accept a ""bad deal"".For the Lib Dems, who want to stop Brexit, Tom Brake said ""Labour leaders are aiding and abetting Theresa May on Brexit"" and accused them of trying to ""trick and stitch up their own conference"" .He said that any referendum had to include the option of remaining in the EU, because ""the only choice a 'deal or no deal' vote gives people is which foot to point the gun at"".By Newsnight political editor Nick WattThe wrangling has led to much soul searching in the new Labour movement taking shape under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. The Momentum group, established to shore up his leadership at the grassroots, has been torn between pro-European instincts and loyalty to Corbyn.He is heir to the Bennite tradition which regards the founding principles of the EU as anathema to Socialism.Momentum was thinking of taking a neutral position had the motion been difficult for Jeremy Corbyn. One Momentum source told me that, while the organisation is strongly pro-European, it would do nothing to jeopardise its main goal; the election of a truly Socialist government.The People's Vote campaign are reasonably content. They know their greatest weakness in Liverpool is they are seen as a bunch of unreconstructed Blairites seeking to thwart the will of the people on the EU and undermine Corbyn in the bargain.The campaign believe they have shown they have far wider support. They hope to have created a space in November for Labour to be able to endorse a referendum on the grounds that warring Conservative MPs agree on one thing - there must be no general election before 2022.Read more from NickIn a statement on Sunday, the prime minister said ""many in Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are trying to thwart Brexit at every step and seeking to exploit this moment for political gain"" by calling for another referendum and extending Article 50 to delay Brexit.Labour's conference in Liverpool began on Sunday with policy announcements on plans for worker representation on company boards and to make employers provide up to 10 days' paid leave for victims of domestic violence.Announcements on Monday will include: Brexit is among eight issues to have been chosen for debate at the conference in Liverpool after a ballot by Labour members and trade unions.The others are Palestine, the economy, housing, schools, government contracts, in-work poverty and justice for the Windrush generation."

The IEA, a free market think-tank, said Mrs May should change tack and pursue an advanced free trade agreement with the EU, with full reciprocal market access, no tariffs in goods including agriculture and maximum recognition of regulatory standards.It said new customs processes had to be put in place that could handle a potential five-fold increase in declarations after Brexit, using enhanced technology and information sharing to separate the movement of goods from the processing of forms for as many traders as possible.What is the so-called Canada option?Concerns over the Irish border could be ""solved"", the IEA argued, by bespoke technical solutions, including trusted trader schemes and streamlined procedures for small businesses. Mr Johnson said the IEA blueprint would allow the UK to ""do a big free trade agreement with the EU but also to do free trade deals around the world"" while Jacob Rees-Mogg said it could win the backing of the EU, Parliament and also ""public opinion"". But former education secretary Nicky Morgan, who favours closer links with the EU after Brexit, said a Canada-style deal would take years to negotiate and might not give the kind of access its supporters hoped for.Mrs Morgan told Conservative Home that the fallback option was for the UK to rejoin the European Free Trade Association, the so-called Norway option which would give the UK preferential market access although it would be required to accept EU rules, including on freedom of movement.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the cabinet had had a ""good, healthy discussion"" and ministers would continue to press the EU on some of the criticisms it had made.""Of course we respect different views across the board but we're not going to suddenly throw up our hands in despair because we've had a bump in the road in these negotiations,"" he said."

The government argues that these warnings represent contingency planning for a worst case scenario, but until they can guarantee that a deal will be done, preparations will have to be made.And with time running out, people will have to start acting on some of the advice as soon as November. The prospect of a no-deal Brexit is beginning to loom large.The government said it was pressing to become a ""listed"" third country when the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, which it says would avoid ""burdensome"" changes to requirements.But if it becomes an ""unlisted"" third country, pet-owners wanting to travel with their animals to EU countries would need to discuss this with a certified ""Official Veterinarian"" at least four months in advance.They would need to prove their pets were free of rabies - which could involve a vaccination followed by at least a 30-day wait before a subsequent blood test, which itself is then followed by a three-month waiting period before travel.The government says it believes reaching a deal with the EU is the most likely outcome but that it is its ""duty as a responsible government"" to prepare for the failure to reach one.The latest batch of 24 no-deal papers also includes warnings that airline passengers could face disruption, coach travel to the EU could be suspended and UK residents may not be able to access online services like Netflix while on European holidays."

Mr Umunna, a leading member of the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, which staged a march in Liverpool on Sunday, wants the option of staying in the EU to be put before voters.He claimed most Labour Party members and members of Mr McCluskey's union wanted the option of staying in the EU.In his conference speech, Mr McCluskey said:  ""If the centre ground is fighting for a better deal for working people and protecting our communities, look no further. It's right here in the Labour Party. ""So Chuka, drop the country club plotting, listen to working people the length and breadth of this country. ""Get behind the party that made you, and join the rest of this movement in fighting to get rid of this rotten government, to give our country the fresh start it needs and make Jeremy Corbyn the people's prime minister.""Mr Umunna has previously denied speculation he and other self-styled moderates are in talks about a new party.But he has also claimed they are being forced out the party by supporters of Mr Corbyn - something denied by Mr Corbyn.Mr Umunna told BBC News: ""I stand by what I have said on bullying and racism in the Labour Party - not least because my own family have been victims of racism - and if Len McCluskey doesn't like that so be it.""Mr McCluskey - a key supporter of Mr Corbyn whose union is Labour's biggest financial backer - also took a swipe at Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge.He did not name her but referred to an incident in which she accused Mr Corbyn of being a racist, at the height of the anti-Semitism row that engulfed the party over the summer.""Anyone screaming 'you are a racist' at Jeremy Corbyn has lost any sense of moral proportion and every shred of decency as well,"" he said to cheers from the Labour faithful.Labour MP Clive Lewis also urged Mr Umunna to get behind the party leadership.""I don't know whether the press reports that Chuka has been in conversations with the Liberal Democrats and others about forming a new centrist party are true,"" he told BBC News.But, he added, he would advise Mr Umunna, to ""get behind the leadership"" and the party's policies ""and help us work towards a Labour government"".

2018-09-24,Labour plans to give tenants more power,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925084922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45621986,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour says it would scrap laws allowing private landlords to evict tenants without giving a reason.The law, in force since 1988, is thought to be the biggest cause of homelessness.Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey announced the policy at the party's conference in Liverpool.Mr Healey also unveiled plans for a Â£20m fund to set up ""renters' unions"" to support tenants in disputes with landlords.So-called ""no-fault"" evictions - when landlords throw people out of their home without saying why - have been growing in recent years.Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research found 80% of private-sector evictions in 2015 fell into this category.Before Section 21 of the 1988 Housing Act came into force it was more difficult for landlords to evict people who paid rent on time.The government has announced plans increase security for tenants in the private rented sector, who now number about 11.5 million people, including minimum tenancies of three years.But Labour says it would go further if it gained power. The party's policies include:In his speech to the Labour faithful in Liverpool, Mr Healey said: ""Tenants who rent from private landlords have been hit hard by the housing crisis.""Labour's commitment is clear: we'll give renters new rights to control rental costs, improve conditions and increase security.""Renters' unions help put power in the hands of tenants.""And the next Labour government will fund set-up costs for these unions across the country to support renters to defend their rights, and make the housing market fairer.""In response, Conservative Housing Secretary James Brokenshire said the costs of a new union for tenants would fall on ""hard-pressed renters""."

But Labour says powers over school admissions and building new schools should be returned to councils.There are about 3,400 secondary schools and 16,700 primary schools in England. Those that are academies are independent, state-funded school and receive their funding directly from central government, rather than through a local authority. Free schools are academies set up by groups of parents, teachers, charities, trusts, religious and voluntary groups. The number of academies and free schools grew dramatically under the coalition government, and has continued under the present Conservative administration.Ministers have argued they help drive up standards through greater innovation and competition in the system.Labour's proposals go further than last year's manifesto which only proposed ending new free schools.Under the party's plans, responsibility for decision-making and budgets could eventually be transferred to a governing body of elected parents, teachers, school staff and community representatives.In her speech, Ms Rayner said the free school and academies schemes ""neither improve standards nor empower staff or parents"".""The Tories have thrown money at an academy and free school programme that is not improving outcomes for pupils, even while individual schools have their budgets cut year after year,"" she said.Labour said it would allow local councils to build new schools and take back control of admissions, adding that it would, during its time in office, ""bring all publically-funded schools back into the public sector with a common rulebook and under local democratic control"".Ms Rayner also said a future Labour government would enforce national pay rules to prevent executives at the chains running free schools paying themselves ""fat cat salaries""."

With the clock counting down to the UK's scheduled exit on 29 March 2019, where does this latest row leave the chances of a deal and what could happen next in the Brexit process?Mrs May has said the two sides remain ""a long way"" apart on the crucial issues of how the UK will trade with the EU after Brexit and the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.She reiterated again her belief that her Chequers blueprint was the only way of properly implementing Brexit and also ensuring a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU in the future. Please upgrade your browserThe PM has also rejected the two options put on the table by the EU - a Norway-style association agreement and a much looser relationship based on Canada's trade deal with the EU. For its part, the EU has said the Chequers plan is unworkable as it fragments the single market. The next few weeks will be crucial if these differences are to be resolved and the two sides are to fulfil their shared aim of an orderly Brexit and an outline agreement on trade, security and other issues. Mrs May has suffered plenty of Brexit setbacks in the past and soldiered but many of her own MPs don't think she is going about the process of leaving the EU the right way.The number of Tories who say they won't vote for the Chequers plan seems to be growing by the day and, remember, any deal she negotiates with the EU has to get through Parliament.There is enormous pressure from the Brexiteer-wing of the party for her to rip up Chequers and throw her weight behind an enhanced version of Canada's 2016 deal with the EU.The so-called Canada Plus Plus option, which removes most customs duties on goods but without paying for access to the single market, is backed by Boris Johnson, David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg, among others, who believe the UK Parliament will vote for it.Many Conservative Remainers, like former minister Justine Greening, have also lost faith in Chequers and think there should be a referendum (more of that later) while some Tories think the UK may well end up in a temporary European Economic Area-style arrangement, sometimes called the Norway option. This would mean accepting the free movement of people and the indirect recognition of European Court of Justice rulings - but would allow businesses access to the EU single market, with some strings attached.Amid speculation about further cabinet resignations if she persists with Chequers, calls for the PM to think again are likely to reach a crescendo at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham.If the PM does not shift on the substance of her Chequers plan, expect much frenzied talk of leadership challenges.Salzburg may have caused a dust-up but it hasn't changed the underlying reality that both sides want as amicable a divorce as possible.Some Tory MPs favour a clean break with the EU, which would see the UK fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization, the global body governing international trade, but they are in a minority.Both sides are ramping up talk of no-deal contingency planning.But they also know that such an outcome would be seen as a political failure and a disaster for business - particularly as the 21-month transition period planned after Brexit day would be scrapped.A summit on 18-19 October of EU leaders was, for a long time, pencilled in as the moment that the two sides would have to look each other in the eye and reach a deal.However, this is not now seen as feasible and the focus is on a special one-off summit that has been arranged for mid-November.An agreement then, the thinking goes, would still allow enough time for the UK and European Parliaments and a supermajority of European states - that's 20 out of 27 - to ratify any deal before the 29 March deadline.So, the clock is ticking but the EU is renowned for finalising deals at the 11th hour and it wouldn't be the first time the talks have seemed on the brink of collapse only for a deal to be pulled out of the fire. If she brings a deal back from Brussels, Theresa May has another big hurdle to negotiate. She must persuade Parliament to back it, in a vote likely before the end of the year or in early 2019.Tory Brexiteers opposed to Chequers have suggested up to 80 MPs would be prepared to vote against it. Although we don't know what the final deal will look like and the size of any rebellion would, in all likelihood, be much smaller, even a dozen Conservatives defying the leadership would risk defeat for the PM, with her non-existent Commons majority.The opposition parties are unlikely to come to the PM's aid, with Labour saying any deal is unlikely to pass its six tests guaranteeing workers' rights and all the ""benefits"" of the single market and customs union.The Labour leadership is hoping to inflict a defeat as a way of triggering a general election.It is written into law that the UK will be leaving at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019, two years to the day after the government notified the EU of its intention to quit, by triggering Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty. But if there is no deal or Parliament rejects the deal, we are in uncharted territory and it is impossible to say with any certainty what will happen next.Mrs May has insisted the 2016 referendum result will not be overturned but if Parliament cannot agree on what kind of Brexit it wants, a fresh public vote might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. But how could this happen?Should Mrs May lose a vote on her deal, she could conceivably resign and her successor may use his or her new mandate to seek Commons approval for a vote on another referendum.Alternatively, MPs who back a so-called People's Vote - which include the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, Plaid Cymru as well as a growing number of Labour MPs - could seek to table a backbench amendment to the legislation that has been promised to implement the UK's withdrawal.With most Tories, so far, publicly opposed to a referendum, any vote is likely to be extremely tight. Either way, Parliament would then need to pass enabling legislation, similar to the 2015 European Referendum Act, setting out the date of the poll, the question and the franchise, as well as other details.  As it stands, if no deal has been agreed by 21 January 2019, ministers will be required to make a statement to Parliament about the next steps. This could trigger the mother of parliamentary battles over Brexit.Some European leaders believe Brexit can be halted but unless Mrs May or her successor and the other 27 nations agree to extend the two-year Article 50 process beyond 29 March, this cannot legally happen. Critics say there won't be enough time while there is also another stumbling block in that those who back a vote do not all agree on what question should be asked on the ballot paper.While the People's Vote campaign wants the option to remain, the Labour leadership has said it should be on the terms of the deal - in other words between leaving with Mrs May's deal or no deal.What Labour really wants is a general election so it can take over the negotiations. It is only after 29 March that discussions about future co-operation - including a trade deal - will really begin in earnest. "
2018-09-24,De-selection row,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925084922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45621357,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSo what was Sunday's row over MP deselections at the Labour Party conference really all about?First, it speaks to the increasing tensions within the party's left wing on how best to solidify the changes Jeremy Corbyn has introduced.The left wing group Momentum wanted to see ""open selections"" where sitting MPs - many of whom didn't vote for Mr Corbyn as their leader - could be challenged between elections.Until now, this could only happen if 50% of local party branches agree.But although most unions are under left wing leadership they wanted to ensure they had a say in the process.So behind closed doors at Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) last night, a compromise was agreed.It will be easier to deselect MPs. Indeed, the Unite leader Len McCluskey had to emphasise just how easy it would be, in order to assuage angry delegates. However, a third of union or local party branches will have to agree to pull the trigger on the starting gun for any contest. It won't be automatic.But what upset many left wing delegates was what they saw as an old fashioned stitch-up worthy of the Blair era.They were given a straight choice between accepting or rejecting the NEC compromise - and no opportunity to vote for open selections.That's why they very nearly threw out the whole conference agenda in protest.Which brings us to the second point: the row tells us that there are now far more delegates on the left of the party than in previous years, even after Jeremy Corbyn became leader.This is underlined by the fact that while the Momentum leadership is now backing the deselection compromise as a step forward, some of their own supporters see this as a sell out. Nonetheless, Momentum will come together again to harry for further change in the years ahead.And in doing so, the friction between the political and industrial wings of this new-look Labour is likely to increase."
2018-09-24,Labour and Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925084922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45625716,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA butterfly flaps its wings with hardly a care in the world and innocently triggers a tornado, goes the theory.The diehard Remain supporters advocating a further EU referendum are hardly retiring butterflies and their campaign is no political tornado.But their call for voters to be given another say on the EU is now, at the very least, a gentle breeze whistling through British politics. It will be felt by all sides in the final phase of the Brexit negotiations.A compromise motion, thrashed out during late night negotiations at the Labour conference in Liverpool, now specifically ties a reluctant Labour leadership to another referendum. The party would back such a move if the leadership's preferred option of a general election failed.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, dashed the hopes of pro-Europeans in the party by suggesting on the Today programme that the option to Remain in the EU should not be on the ballot paper. The choice should instead be about the proposed Brexit deal.But the loose wording of the Labour party does not rule out a Remain option on the ballot paper and McDonnell conceded that it would be up to Parliament to decide the wording.The wrangling has led to much soul searching in the new Labour movement taking shape under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. The Momentum group, established to shore up his leadership at the grassroots, has been torn between pro-European instincts and loyalty to Corbyn. He is heir to the Bennite tradition which regards the founding principles of the EU as anathema to Socialism.Momentum was thinking of taking a neutral position had the motion been difficult for Jeremy Corbyn. One Momentum source told me that, while the organisation is strongly pro-European, it would do nothing to jeopardise its main goal; the election of a truly Socialist government.The People's Vote campaign are reasonably content. They know their greatest weakness in Liverpool is they are seen as a bunch of unreconstructed Blairites seeking to thwart the will of the people on the EU and undermine Corbyn in the bargain.The campaign believe they have shown they have far wider support. They hope to have created a space in November for Labour to be able to endorse a referendum on the grounds that warring Conservative MPs agree on one thing - there must be no general election before 2022.And they believe that the motion leaves open the possibility of an option to Remain in the EU on the ballot paper. One source in the People's Vote campaign told me: ""The door is now wide open.""The numbers in parliament suggest that if Labour endorses a further referendum it would be difficult to pass the legislation without a sizeable contingent of Tory MPs defying Theresa May. But the events in Liverpool now set the stage for the issue of a further referendum to become everyone's favourite weapon in the final phase of the Brexit negotiations.To pro-Europeans it is an escape hatch if Theresa May fails to negotiate a deal with the EU or she negotiates a deal that is rejected by Parliament.To Brexiteers the People's Vote campaign does their work for them. Leavers have consistently said that the pro-European side represents an out of touch elite afraid to accept the judgment of the people. And along comes a well funded campaign seeking to overturn the results of a referendum they won by more than a million votes.Theresa May is using the threat of another referendum to warn Brexiteers opposed to her plan to be careful what they wish for. Brexiteers invited to dinner in Downing Street recently were reportedly told if the prime minister's plans collapse then the commons speaker John Bercow will help create the conditions to vote through a further referendum.The EU is, of course, watching events very closely. Some EU leaders said at last week's summit that they would be happy to extend the article 50 negotiations to allow a further referendum to take place. Innocently or not that sort of talks infuriates Theresa May who says the mere talk of a vote allows the EU to hold back in the hope the UK changes its mind.An innocent butterfly going about its business may never unleash a tornado over British politics. But it is certainly changing the weather.You can watch Newsnight on BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or on Iplayer. Subscribe to the programme on YouTube or follow them on Twitter."

First, the idea that the UK wants to ""have its cake and eat it"".

They found that while Twitter is useful for communicating with journalists, not so many other people people use it regularly.  However, Tusk did post this bombastic video on his Twitter account, showing his Autumn priorities in the style of an action film trailer.Coming up this autumn: #EUCO, #UNGA, #ASEM12, #G20, internal and external security, migration, rules-based multilateral cooperation, economy, trade, and of course #Brexit.Bring it on! pic.twitter.com/gBFkfvvo7HEnd of Twitter post  by @eucopresidentInstagram, on the other hand, is very popular with a range of groups, especially younger people.

""Brexit will have consequences for the Netherlands no matter what"" and ""everything must be done"" to prevent a no-deal Brexit, it quotes him as saying. The Netherlands has a greater interest in a ""decent deal"" than other EU countries, given the Dutch economy's reliance on exports, the daily says. ""Brexit is threatening our exports, our jobs, and our wallets,"" De Telegraaf quotes Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra as saying. Mr Hoekstra lists Brexit as one of the risks to Dutch economic growth, alongside geopolitical instability and trade conflicts, the daily notes. ""The Dutch government is preparing for chaos and problems"" when the UK leaves the EU, broadcaster RTL observes. Belgium's De Standaard quotes Economy Minister Kris Peeters as saying that a no-deal hard Brexit ""remains a very realistic option for now"". The paper notes that much is at stake for Belgium since 10% of its exports go to the UK, accounting for 40,000 dependent jobs.In Slovakia, Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Frantisek Ruzicka says a hard Brexit would have a ""direct impact on Slovak citizens living in the UK, trade, and services"", Teraz.sk website reports. Mr Ruzicka says Slovakia hopes the UK will be able to negotiate a political deal with the EU.  Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said at the EU summit on Brexit in Salzburg that ""we really care about ending the impasse between the UK and Europe"" and he called for stability for Polish citizens and businesses in the UK. Mr Morawiecki acknowledged that the negotiations had been nerve-racking, according to Gazeta Prawna.""In Austria, the 27 should understand that the Irish issue is the only difficulty on the way to making an agreement,"" France's Le Monde states. It notes that Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is pursuing a strategy of ""de-dramatisation"", showing a ""willingness to compromise"" on the backstop proposal for the Irish border. At the same time, European leaders are preparing to limit the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, the daily says. After all, London is pursuing ""intense lobbying to try to divide the Continental front"".Salzburg could be an ""occasion to start off on the right foot again"" after a ""summer of continued crises"" - but ""this will not be the case"", France's Le Figaro believes.  Theresa May is ""one of the few adults"" among the ""big kids of London"", Germany's centre-left Spiegel says. And this is why politicians are inclined to be friendly to her.But Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung notes that Brussels does not want to make any move before the UK Conservative Party conference. ""The fear is too great that any type of constructive proposal at Salzburg will be taken down by the Brexiteers.""  ""The passivity with which above all Angela Merkel is letting Brexit make its way bureaucratically is short-sighted,"" political editor for Die Zeit, Jochen Bittner, argues. It is precisely on the matter of sovereign borders that ""Europe could accommodate Britain with the concession that a little more control would not in any way destroy Europe's union thinking"", Bittner says. ""There are already possibilities"" for a cap on immigration within the EU, ""a kind of emergency brake"", which could be an ""insurance against that fear of overloading that made many Britons vote to leave"", he says.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK but talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan, which was the UK's official view of a proposed Brexit deal.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May held an awayday for the cabinet at her country residence - Chequers - in July. At this gathering a favoured UK position for Brexit talks was agreed. It included proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals and says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland.

The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-24,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925084922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

""What we've said is all options must be considered if and when this government collapses or its negotiations collapse - the options are still there."""

But Sir Keir said the six tests his party has set - including guarantees on workers' rights and retaining the economic benefits of existing market arrangements - were unlikely to be met.""Some have said Labour could vote for any deal the Tories reach. Some have said we may abstain. Some have said we may vote for a vague deal,"" he said.""So, let me be very clear - right here, right now: if Theresa May brings back a deal that does not meet our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts. ""And if the prime minister thinks we'll wave through a vague deal asking us to leap blindfolded into the unknown, she can think again.""But Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said any vote on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations could not be a re-run of the 2016 in-out referendum.""Despite what Keir said earlier, it's a public vote on the terms of our departure,"" he said. ""We desperately need a better, fairer society - we need to heal the wounds of Brexit, not reopen them, and only our movement, united with a proud socialist government, is capable of doing that.""The Labour Leave campaign group, which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum, said Sir Keir was ""playing with fire"" and talk of a referendum made Labour look like ""the party of Remain"". ""We're damaging the Labour brand and alienating our supporters,"" said its general secretary Brendan Chilton.""We have already had a vote on the UK's membership of the EU; it's been done and dusted. The Labour Party and its members must accept this and move on.""The prime minister's Chequers plan, which would see the UK staying closely aligned to the EU in some areas, such as the trade in goods, has been criticised by EU leaders and many of her own MPs.The Conservatives accused Labour of ""playing political games"".""Labour seem determined to take us all back to square one by rejecting a deal out of hand then trying to delay Brexit and re-run the referendum,"" said Brexit minister Robin Walker.

2018-09-25,Corbyn pledges more free childcare,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925213615/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45642660,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJeremy Corbyn is expected to use his conference speech in Liverpool to pledge an expansion of free childcare.Labour has previously said it would offer 30 hours of ""genuinely free"" childcare to all parents of two, three and four-year-olds in England.Mr Corbyn will say Labour will also offer extra, means-tested subsidised hours on top of this allowance.These will be free for the poorest households and cost no more than Â£4 per hour for higher incomes, Labour says.Currently most working parents in England and Wales are entitled to 30 free childcare hours for three and four-year-old children during term time.Campaigners say this has left some childcare providers struggling to remain open because of increased running costs and a lack of government funding.Mr Corbyn will say the current offer is ""free in name only"", describing Labour's ""universal"" offer as a ""vital and long overdue change"".He will also promise to improve the pay and skill levels of childcare staff.""Opportunity matters most in the earliest years of life,"" he will say.""It is a crucial time to open up children's life chances. Driving up standards of childcare will make that vital difference for millions of our children.""Households where a parent earns more than Â£100,000 are also not currently eligible for free child care.Labour say the plans will cost Â£4.5bn.It would be paid for, a spokesman said, by ""taxes on the top 5% of earners and big companies"".CBI deputy director general Josh Hardie said: ""Business has long called for support to parents to make childcare more affordable. ""The challenge will be to find ways to fund affordable childcare sustainably and sensibly. The prize will be significant for working families across the UK and can play a serious role in reducing the gender pay gap.""Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi, responding for the Conservatives, said it was another ""unfunded promise"" from Mr Corbyn."
2018-09-25,Immigration cut 'shouldn't hurt economy',https://web.archive.org//web/20180925213615/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45642896,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNew immigration rules introduced after Brexit must continue to bring numbers down but in a way that does not damage the UK economy, Theresa May has said.Speaking on a trip to the US, the prime minister said ending the free movement of people from the EU was ""non-negotiable"" in the Brexit talks.Public concerns over immigration levels had to be recognised, she said. On Monday, the cabinet agreed that EU citizens should face the same migration rules as those from elsewhere.Theresa May's ministers unanimously supported a system based on skills rather than nationality, following a lengthy meeting in Downing Street.The prime minister has repeatedly vowed to end unlimited immigration from Europe after Brexit but some fear that any ban on low-skilled EU migrants may damage business.Speaking en route to New York for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, Mrs May said the interests of businesses and the concerns of the public had to be balanced.""People voted to bring an end to free movement and we will do that,"" she said.""As we look at the future proposals for our immigration rules what we want to do is to ensure that we are recognising the concerns that people have about immigration; that we are working to continue to bring net migration down but obviously that we do that in a way that is good for the British economy.""Monday's cabinet agreement came after a presentation from the MAC chairman, Prof Alan Manning, at a lengthy meeting.According to one source, the principle was agreed that the UK would not show bias towards immigrants from any one part of the world over another when granting access to work.However, one cabinet source told the BBC the agreement did not constitute a firm decision and a government source said there could be ""light touch migration"" rules for EU nationals as part of any wider Brexit trade deal.The government does not call this ""preferential"" treatment because a similar arrangement could be struck with, for example, the US as part of a UK-US trade deal.The EU's principle of freedom of movement currently allows people from the European Economic Area - all EU countries, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - plus Switzerland, to travel and work within the area without visas, regardless of skills.Anyone wanting to move to the UK from outside the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, to work or study needs to apply for one of a number of visas.These range from Tier 1, preserved for investors and ""exceptional talent"", to Tier 5 visas for short-term voluntary and educational programmes.The two most common are the Tier 2 skilled worker visas and Tier 4 student visas. Currently, no Tier 3 - unskilled labour - visas are being given out.Some of these visas allow people to apply to bring dependants such as children and partners.Visas work on a points-based system and the criteria have got tougher in recent years.For example, for a Tier 2 ""experienced skilled worker"" visa, people now need to be paid at least Â£30,000 to apply, up almost Â£10,000 from 2011. People get more points for higher salaries or if their job is on the list of shortage occupations.Most visas come with other conditions, including knowledge of English, the need for a sponsor and agreeing not to claim benefits for a period of time.Last week, the Migration Advisory Committee, an independent public body which advises ministers on migration issues, called for the annual limit on the number of high-skilled workers from outside the EU granted permission to work to be scrapped.Currently set at 20,700 a year, the cap - imposed by Mrs May when at the Home Office - has resulted in thousands of IT specialists and NHS candidates being denied visas.Please upgrade your browserThe UK is due to withdraw from the European Union on 29 March next year, although an ""implementation period"" lasting until 31 December 2020 has been agreed as part of the proposed Brexit deal being negotiated between the UK and the EU.In that transition period, EU citizens arriving in the UK would enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive beforehand. The same would apply to UK expats on the continent.It remains unclear what would happen in the event of a ""no-deal"" Brexit, as the transition period would not then happen and the new migration system would, government sources say, have to be ""tapered in"" because it would not be ready by March."

Mr Monehen's motion was then seconded by Zahid Ali, whose speech calling for an end to the blockade of Gaza and arms sales to Israel, was greeted with chants of: ""Free! Free! Palestine,"" as leader Jeremy Corbyn looked on from a seat on the platform.Next on stage was shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who gave a fiery speech hailing Labour's history of fighting against fascism and racism and vowing the party would never again get involved in ""illegal, aggressive wars of intervention"". But she also addressed the anti-Semitism row that engulfed Labour over the summer, telling delegates: ""If we want to root out fascism and racism and hatred from our world, and from our country, then we must start, we must start, with rooting it out of our own party.""There are sickening individuals on the fringes of our movement who use our legitimate support for Palestine as a cloak and a cover for their despicable hatred of Jewish people and their desire to see Israel destroyed. ""Those people stand for everything that we have always stood against and they must be kicked out of our party."" She also called on Labour members to end ""the pointless conflicts which divide our movement, which poison our online debate, and which distract us from fighting the Tories"".Ms Thornberry's speech was given an enthusiastic standing ovation as she was hugged by Mr Corbyn.Before the Palestinian debate could resume, Rhea Woolfson, chairing the conference, issued a warning to members.""Please think carefully about the language you use and how you express yourself,"" she said.""Please make sure nobody is booed or heckled for having a view you disagree with.""Ms Woolfson warned one delegate to be careful with her language while criticising anti-Semitism allegations against the party.After recommending an al-Jazeera documentary called The Lobby, Hillary Wise was told by Ms Woolfson: ""I would ask you to be very careful with your language right now because you're staying into territory thatâ¦""Ms Wise, from Ealing and Acton Central, singled out the media for criticism, saying: ""The message really is shame on you for picking up and amplifying these allegations.""I'm afraid to tell you this is going to get worse as the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn-led government gets ever closer.""Later in the debate, a Jewish delegate criticised the Labour leadership for their response to anti-Semitism, while speaking against the Israeli government.""Why has it taken so long to recognise these fears for the Jewish community?"" asked Steve Lapsley.""The motion - which I support - gives a one-sided narrative, which triggers emotional responses rather than wise ones. ""This isn't helped - I'm afraid - by some members of our party, and some members of our PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party] who are actively supporting suspended anti-Semites right now on platforms."""

""So they want to escape what they have created.""But it's for governments, representing the people, to say we are not going to allow our societies to be suborned into that kind of dystopian world view.""Facebook's business model - free content in exchange for personal data - had never been debated and had just been presented as a ""fait accompli"", argued Ms Eagle.""It's beginning to look a bit sinister,"" she told the meeting.Social media was a powerful tool which could be harnessed for good but it was increasingly being used by extreme groups ""winding each other up"" to commit acts of violence in the real world.""We are polarising and fragmenting our society and getting rid of empathy for the other person,"" said Ms Eagle, who briefly challenged for the Labour leadership two years ago.""Some of that is why our politics is so divisive and nasty and hostile at the moment.""She called for an end to user anonymity on the internet and government action to ""preserve democracy, the rule of law and our belief in the truth and our capacity to have access to the facts"".Tech giants could be forced by law to change their business model so that data was held for the common good, she suggested. ""Mark Zuckerberg doesn't get to choose. We have to choose,"" added the Wallasey MP.Birgitte Anderson, chief executive of the Big Innovation Centre, a London-based tech investment hub, also responded to the nationalisation question.""I think that would be impossible because the internet is a global thing,"" she said.

2018-09-25,MP warns May not to put Chequers to vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925213615/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45642894,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA group of Conservative MPs will vote as a block against any Brexit deal based on Theresa May's Chequers plan, ministers have been warned.Mark Francois told the BBC that he and other members of the European Research Group could not support the PM's plans as they ""do not represent Brexit"".Asked how many MPs could rebel, he said it was ""well north of 50"". Mr Francois said the PM would ""lose"" any vote and should embrace an alternative Canada-style trade plan.Earlier on Tuesday, Labour said it was likely to oppose any deal negotiated by Theresa May as it did not meet its six tests, lessening the chances of it getting through Parliament. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry told the party's conference the PM was proposing a ""false choice"" between a deal based on her Chequers blueprint for future co-operation - which would see the UK align closely with EU rules on trade in goods - and no deal at all.The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Parliament will vote on any withdrawal deal, if it is agreed, before the end of the year or early next year.Mr Francois suggested any deal based on Chequers had no chance of winning parliamentary approval and a looser Canada-style accord, which would not require the UK to sign up to EU rules, was what was needed.""If it is based on Chequers then myself and my colleagues in the ERG cannot vote for Chequers because we believe it doesn't represent Brexit,"" the former defence minister told BBC Radio 4's World at One.""If push really comes to shove and they try to put Chequers through the House of Commons then I and my colleagues will vote against it. ""In those circumstances the prime minister would then want to renegotiate along the lines of a free trade agreement, but far better that she pivots to that free trade agreement now before trying to take Chequers to the House of Commons and losing.""Although it is not clear how many MPs are currently affiliated to the ERG, 62 MPs signed a letter by the group in February urging the PM to revert to what they say was the vision of Brexit championed in her Lancaster House speech.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has indicated he will vote against the plans, said recently the ERG had about 30 to 40 members, with a core group of about a dozen.No 10 insisted that ministers were united behind the PM's plan at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said there were no guarantees that any withdrawal agreement would be signed off by the UK and EU Parliaments.""While we may assume that because something is agreed at European Council with the UK that it will go through both parliaments, we shouldn't actually assume it,"" he told the Irish Parliament.""We're just going to have to manage that and see how it develops."""

They were believed to be concerned that an election for the new post raised the prospect of a candidate standing on a platform of a new EU referendum, ramping up pressure on the leadership over the issue, BBC Political Correspondent Iain Watson said.One left-wing group, the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, labelled the motion as ""ill-thought through tokenism"" and recommended that delegates vote against. But the motion was withdrawn before a vote could take place.Angela Marincowitz-Skillen, from Wirral West Labour Party, spoke in support of the principle but withdrew the plan, asking the NEC to find a way to hold elections for both deputies at the same time.She said: ""There have been disturbing reports that this rule change has widespread support because those who want to divide our party and deny Jeremy Corbyn want to use this as a way to do it, making an election about a new deputy leader about Brexit, a new centre party or whatever project they think up to sow disunity.""I want to say to those people the membership are sick of this sectarian game.""Reacting to the decision, Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips tweeted: ""It's not a factional game for God's sake"".The female deputy leader proposal was championed by Unite leader Len McCluskey, and had initially been seen as an attempt to undermine Mr Watson, who has faced criticism from Mr Corbyn's supporters.But he got behind the idea and told BBC News it was a ""shame"" it had been dropped.He said: ""I am very disappointed by that because I think it has put the cause of gender representation back in the Labour party.""But the debate will continue. I think we need greater women's representation at all levels in the Labour Party and I am going to continue to campaign for that.""Ofcourse I think we should never find ourselves in situation where there is no women in the leadership team of our party and possibly our country. Ofcourse that needs changing through structure, it's not a game it's our lives. As usual if we don't benefit the men we don't matterEnd of Twitter post  by @jessphillipsFormer NEC member Luke Akehurst tweeted: ""Disgusting that Wirral West remitting has killed the chance of a woman second deputy Leader - because the Hard Left were scared a moderate would win, scared of party democracy.""Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott were all being spoken of as contenders for the deputy leadership.By the BBC's Katy Dillon It was Tom Watson who urged Labour's NEC to recommend a new deputy.But the Labour leadership became suspicious of Watson's motives, and the BBC has seen the document they produced suggesting that the ruling body recommend voting against the motion.  But instead - due to the potentially difficult optics of the Labour Party not wanting a woman in leadership position - a ""vote for"" recommendation was granted.The leadership were still said to be concerned. The fear stemmed from any such election turning into either a referendum on Jeremy Corbyn's leadership or, with a pro-second EU referendum candidate, a poll on Labour's position on the issue. It's been said that the leadership did some canvassing on behalf of their preferred candidate - Dawn Butler - and the unfavourable response added to their concern that another less pliable candidate could win the title and cause further headaches.It seems work was being done behind the scenes which resulted in the motion being withdrawn.Although this may please the leadership in the short term, in the long term it could convince critics that Labour has a problem with women in leadership positions.

2018-09-25,'Nuclear button' pushed on scheme - Foster,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925213615/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45637786,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe DUP leader has said it is a ""great regret"" that she did not sack Jonathan Bell as enterprise minister when she became first minister in 2016.Arlene Foster is giving evidence to the Renewable Heat Incentive inquiry.She was in charge of energy matters for NI when the green energy scheme was set up in 2012, to encourage uptake of eco-friendly heating systems.Overgenerous fuel subsidies meant costs spiralled out of control, leaving NI taxpayers with a Â£490m bill.Mrs Foster served as enterprise minister before becoming finance minister in 2015, and then DUP leader and Northern Ireland's first minister in January 2016, when her predecessor Peter Robinson stood down.Mr Bell replaced her as enterprise minister in May 2015: the RHI inquiry has heard evidence from a number of witnesses that he was unsuitable for the job.Mr Bell is a key figure in the RHI scandal - he brought problems with the scheme to public attention in December 2016, claiming he had been pressured by others in the DUP to extend RHI when he tried to close it.Asked why she had not replaced him when she took over the party reins, Mrs Foster said an assembly election campaign was looming and that removing him at that time could have raised political questions over his suitability as a candidate for the party.Mrs Foster said there was a general view in the party that Mr Bell should not remain in post, but she said other party officials asked: ""How much harm can he do in three months?""She also claimed there was a concern he could ""go in inverted commas 'rogue' if he was replaced as a minister"" when Mrs Foster replaced Peter Robinson. Mrs Foster said Mr Bell never accepted her leadership, nor did he take his responsibilities seriously and she claimed he acted as if he was ""to be served, rather than serve"".She said he ""hero-worshipped"" Mr Robinson and when he retired, it showed in Mr Bell's behaviour.""I take full responsibility for my actions as first minister and the decision to keep him in post until the election was over,"" she added.Earlier on Tuesday, Mrs Foster was challenged to explain why she forgot about a meeting in which she was told of problems with the RHI scheme.The meeting happened in early June 2015 after Mrs Foster became finance minister.She told the public inquiry - which was set up to investigate the scheme's failings in January 2017 - the warning was the first time she had been made aware of possible problems.Northern Ireland's former first minister headed up the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Deti) when the RHI scheme was designed in 2012.Crucial controls to limit the scheme's cost were not introduced, something she has since said is her ""deepest political regret"".But Mrs Foster - who spent six months as finance minister from June 2015 before being elevated to party leader and first minister - fiercely contested claims by Jonathan Bell, her party colleague and successor as enterprise minister, that she ordered him to keep the scheme open.In the wake of his allegations, she faced calls to step aside to allow a judge-led public inquiry into the scheme.Her time as first minister was brought to an abrupt end when the late Martin McGuinness of Sinn FÃ©in resigned as deputy first minister, forcing an election last March.She remains DUP leader, but there has been no return to Stormont for almost 600 days, due to the ongoing impasse between her party and Sinn FÃ©in.Mrs Foster said she was told about the issues by former DUP special adviser (Spad) Timothy Cairns, who was then working in the enterprise department.He told Mrs Foster that officials in enterprise had ""dropped the ball"" and failed to ensure the proper approvals were in place for spending on RHI.Mrs Foster said she had ""no clear recollection"" of the meeting, although she did not dispute that it happened.She said she had conflated the meeting in early June, with another later that month where Mr Cairns had asked for help from Mrs Foster's ministerial adviser Andrew Crawford, who had just spent seven years in enterprise.Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin asked why she had no recollection of the early June meeting.She said she did not believe it had been presented to her as a ""big issue"".Sir Patrick said: ""If someone comes along and tells you that a scheme which had developed under your bailiwick is in difficulties to the extent that the department has dropped the ball, one might have thought, you would have thought that was quite important.""Mrs Foster said she could not explain why she had forgotten about the meeting, but added she had many matters to deal with in her role as finance minister.Later, Mrs Foster conceded there was ""room for improvement"" in how unelected special advisers (Spads) are appointed by political parties at Stormont.The inquiry has already heard claims that the DUP had its own practice of appointing advisers to ministers, which directly went against the ministerial code that states ministers are supposed to choose who they want to advise them. Mr Bell had claimed he would not have chosen Timothy Cairns as his Spad, but he signed a pre-written letter drafted by the party confirming he was choosing Mr Cairns.Mrs Foster told the inquiry she acknowledged the need for improvement, but said it had to come ""across the board"" from all political parties at Stormont.Sir Patrick said it seemed to him that there had been a common approach by the parties that there was ""an act and a mandatory code, but no-one pays a great deal of attention to it"". Mrs Foster said she could understand the panel's ""frustration"" about the code, but said there had been legislative changes throughout the past 10 years to how advisers were appointed.""Should there be more, yes I think there probably should, in terms of transparency,"" she added.In addition to Mrs Foster, three senior DUP officials will also be giving evidence to the inquiry this week: On Tuesday, the DUP leader also said she understood why the conduct of her former closest adviser - Andrew Crawford - was a matter of huge concern for the RHI inquiry.He was her most senior adviser in the finance department in summer 2015, as the scheme's costs were rocketing.At that time, he was engaged in conversations with the poultry industry, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the scheme.She said she knew Mr Crawford was having discussions with others in the party about energy issues but not specifically about RHI cost controls.But her evidence is that she never asked him for details and he did not provide it.The inquiry has heard how Mr Crawford had a series of engagements with fellow DUP adviser Timothy Cairns about potential cuts in subsidies for businesses on the scheme - many of them poultry farms.Mr Crawford predicted a huge spike in applications - something which later occurred putting the scheme hugely over-budget.He also offered anecdotal evidence that empty poultry sheds were being heated to maximise subsidy returns, and suggested a scheme change that would have ensured poultry farmers maintained their potential income from the scheme even after it was amended.Inquiry panellist Keith MacLean said not only had Mr Crawford been giving ""bad advice"", but was suggesting something that worked against efforts to control the scheme spend.  Mrs Foster said he never raised allegations of scheme abuse, or the potential of an applications spike with her.She told the inquiry she now believed both of those issues should have been raised with her as finance minister, both because of the alleged abuse and the potential impact of spending commitments on public finances.Dr MacLean said it was not hard to see why the inquiry was concerned about the calibre of people being appointed as Spads.He said: ""It gives us a big question as to what on earth was your Spad doing in this involvement without your knowledge?""""I accept that,"" Mrs Foster said.The inquiry has also heard evidence Mr Crawford sent confidential government documents to family members who were RHI claimants.The documents warned them about the plans to introduce cost controls to remove the lucrative subsidies.Inquiry counsel David Scoffield asked Mrs Foster that if the panel finds Mr Crawford breached standards, to what degree she holds some responsibility for his actions as his former minister.Mrs Foster said she was accountable for Mr Crawford's behaviour, as she was for all her departmental officials.But she said she failed to see how she could ""be responsible for that breach"", if a special adviser acted outside the rules.""If he had committed a criminal offence as a Spad, I don't see how the panel would be asking me to be responsible for that,"" she said.""I'm accountable but I'm not responsible."""

Mr Corbyn, then a backbench MP, addressed the crowds in Hyde Park.""In my view, Jeremy Corbyn stands on the threshold of Downing Street today because he stood on that stage in 2003 and spoke for the millions of all of us who wanted an agenda of peace and justice - not neo-Conservative war - and we are now within touching distance of that agenda coming to fruition,"" said Mr Murray.The trade union official, a former communist, was last week mocked by Labour's deputy leader for suggesting the ""deep state"" was against him.The packed Stop the War fringe meeting was also addressed by shadow cabinet members Richard Burgon and Diane Abbott, as well as leading Corbyn-supporting MP Chris Williamson, among others.Mr Burgon accused some of the party's MPs of being ""unwavering and very vocal advocates of bombing"".Ms Abbott said Mr Corbyn's ""internationalist"" policy agenda was just as important as his domestic one - and ""Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10"" would not just make people richer it would make them ""safer by being a force for peace""."
2018-09-25,UK life expectancy progress 'has stopped',https://web.archive.org//web/20180925213615/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-45638646,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLife expectancy in the UK has stopped improving for the first time since 1982, when figures began. Women's life expectancy from birth remains 82.9 years and for men it is 79.2, the figures from the Office for National Statistics, for 2015-17, show. In some parts of the UK, life expectancy has even decreased.For men and women in Scotland and Wales, it declined by more than a month. Men in Northern Ireland have seen a similar fall.For women in Northern Ireland, and for men and women in England, life expectancy at birth is unchanged.The ONS said the stalling of life expectancy was linked to a particularly high number of deaths from 2015 to 2017, which coincided with a bad flu season and excess winter deaths.It said there was ""much ongoing debate"" about the reasons behind this and what direction the trend may take in the future.It is not clear what is driving the trend, but some academics have argued that government austerity policies, such as cuts to social care budgets in England, must have played a part. Ministers have said that no such causation can be proved, although Public Health England has been asked to carry out a review of life expectancy trends.Dr Kingsley Purdam, senior lecturer in social research methods and statistics at the University of Manchester, said the figures were ""shocking"". ""Poverty, austerity and cuts to public services are impacting on how long people are living in the UK,"" he said. ""We all need to look after our health but many of us, including the most vulnerable populations, need help at a time when evidence suggests that services are being cut.""The lost years of life have an impact not just on the individual but on those people who are ultimately left behind including partners, children and grandchildren.""  But Prof Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said there were other factors that might explain the stall in progress.""We still do not know how much this is a result of direct health effects such as flu epidemics, how much is a result of social and economic factors, and how much is a failure to go on improving smoking cessation or other preventive measures,"" he said.The data also shows that the UK lags behind other leading countries for life expectancy, including Switzerland, Japan, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy.Of the countries the ONS compared the UK with, Switzerland was the nation with the longest life expectancy for men. For women, it is Japan.Men in Switzerland are expected to live to 81.5 years. Women in Japan are predicted to live to 87. Throughout the 20th Century, the UK experienced steady improvements in life expectancy at birth, resulting in a larger and older population.This has been attributed to healthier lifestyles among the population as it ages, such as reduced smoking rates, and improvements in treating infectious illnesses and conditions such as heart disease. But in recent years, the progress has slowed. And in the latest data it has ground to a halt. The population of people who are 90 or over is still increasing but this is due to previous improvements in life expectancy going back many decades. The number of centenarians decreased slightly between 2016 and 2017, reflecting low numbers of births during World War One. But the ONS said it was expected to continue to increase again from 2019.By Robert Cuffe, BBC News head of statistics Since the 1980s, life expectancy has been going up by roughly two months a year every year, as we saw fewer deaths due to smoking or heart problems. But after 2011, that rate of improvement has been slowing. It could be because it's hard to keep on improving every year. It could be because of hard winters or difficult flu seasons. But we're not sure about exactly what has caused this trend. So this data is really telling us about death rates in the UK for the past three years. And we can be sure that picture in death rates is real. How sure can we be that you'll live as long as the ONS predicts?Not very - the ONS is not making precise predictions about what will happen in the future to determine how long you live. Medical breakthroughs, pandemics and the wars of the next 80 years are impossible to predict. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""Recent trends in life expectancy and mortality in the UK can also be seen in a number of countries across Europe, North America and Australia. ""As part of our long-term plan for the health service, we are taking action to help people live longer and healthier lives - cancer survival is at a record high while smoking rates are at an all-time low - backed by our additional funding of an extra Â£20.5bn a year by 2023-24, which will transform care for cancer and other chronic diseases."""

What is Labour's Brexit policy, and what does it think should happen next?First of all, Labour says the government's Brexit proposals are failing to meet the six tests that Labour set out last year.Labour says these are the tests against which it will judge any final Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May's government, as part of the Article 50 negotiations on leaving the EU. They are: Labour has now published a report, which says all six of the tests are ""on course to be failed"".""Let me be very clear - right here, right now,"" Sir Keir told the BBC. ""If Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts.""But there are buts. When you look at the tests it is hardly surprising that they are on course to be failed, because of the way Labour set them out in the first place, as a way to judge the final Brexit deal. What is being negotiated between the UK and the EU now is the withdrawal agreement - the terms of divorce, rather than the precise detail of the future relationship. So it's not the final deal, and that makes some of the tests rather hard to assess fully at this stage. Take test number one: does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the EU? No-one can ensure that at the moment, and we probably won't know for sure until long after we've left. If a deal on a withdrawal agreement is done, it will be accompanied by a non-binding political declaration, which will presumably gush enthusiastically about a strong partnership in the future. Please upgrade your browserBoth sides want a strong partnership; they will remain neighbours. But the details will have to be negotiated later. A political declaration would set the tone and give some detail, but it could still lead to a blind Brexit: in other words, leaving without knowing our final destination.Take test number two: does a deal give the UK the ""exact same benefits"" as membership of the single market and the customs union? Well there's only really one way to achieve the ""exact same benefits"" and that's staying in the single market and the customs union, which is not official Labour policy. Labour says it wants to stay in ""a"" customs union, and stay as close to the single market as possible. That is not the same as membership, so you can argue that even current Labour policy would fail its own test. Labour is keen to emphasise that the six tests are based on promises and commitments the government made about what it would achieve in Brexit negotiations. So this process was certainly a way of holding the government to account. But the tests were also broad enough to cope with divisions within the Labour party about the best way forward. Now, though, the six tests have led to a decisive moment - barring unexpected developments, Labour will vote against a Brexit deal, increasing the chances that it will get rejected. Sir Keir says that's because the government has ""no credible plan"" for Brexit. But does the Labour party have one?Sir Keir confirmed that Labour wanted a general election if the government is defeated in a ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit. The trouble with that strategy is that an election is not in Labour's gift. If Prime Minister Theresa May decided to call for an election, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act two-thirds of MPs would have to vote in favour (or go through a no-confidence procedure). And even if a snap election were to take place, it's not clear what would be in a Labour manifesto. Would it include explicit support for another referendum? Would it openly support staying in the single market, even on an interim basis?What we do know is that under the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act, the government would have 21 days to tell Parliament what it intended to do next if MPs rejected a Brexit deal in a ""meaningful vote"". Debates would have to take place in the House of Commons and the House of Lords within seven days. But what would be debated?These are obviously uncharted waters, and it may be up to the Speaker to decide whether any motions to be considered in parliament at that time could be amended, to allow, for example, for MPs to call for another referendum.The government's thinking on the Speaker's role is set out in this Written Ministerial Statement.Pushing for another referendum may well become Labour's main strategy, if it is unable to force an election. In his speech to conference, Sir Keir said the party had to be able to put forward alternatives to leaving the EU with no deal, including - crucially - campaigning for a public vote.   When the shadow Brexit secretary emphasised that nobody was ruling out Remain as an option in such a vote (a remark that was not in the text of the speech distributed to journalists) he received a standing ovation. But not everyone in the party was cheering.Groups like Labour Leave hold a very different view, arguing that ""throwing around the possibility of a second referendum is devastating to the party's brand"". Brexit involves big decisions about the way the country is run, bigger than this generation of politicians has faced before. So it is not surprising that the arguments within both Labour and the Conservatives go well beyond traditional party loyalties. But time is running very short for those decisions to be made.

2018-09-25,Warehouse edition,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925213615/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45627152,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWhere will all the stuff go?Because it is hard to see how Brexit doesn't (at some point) involve British businesses wanting or needing to keep more stuff closer to home. By stuff, I mean parts, raw materials or inventories of finished products. There is a short term and, to a lesser extent, a longer term question here. Given uncertainty about what happens next March when we leave the EU, many businesses may want to have extra supplies on hand in case a disorderly exit leads to disruption at our borders. One estimate put this stockpiling of imports at about Â£40 billion.But longer-term, more bureaucracy, paperwork, checks or delays on imports could also induce companies to keep more (and potentially manufacture more) in the UK.  This would be a much smaller figure - but could vary depending on what exactly the new arrangements are and how confident companies feel that they will to work. And the trouble is, the UK doesn't have much space - specifically warehousing space. We are, according to property company Savills, an ""under-warehoused country"". Our warehousing stock works out to about 7.6 square foot of space per head compared to the US at 39 square foot per head. It is also a market that has been squeezed both on the supply and the demand side. Speculative development - or building a warehouse without a tenant already signed up to take it - fell sharply after the financial crisis started in 2007. Readily-available funding to speculatively build large warehouses and logistics facilities has never really recovered.Meanwhile, the rapacious growth of e-commerce has gobbled up space in recent years. Amazon dominated the market in terms of demand between about 2014 and 2016, according to one expert, and retailing still accounts for about two-thirds of take-up of space. The result is this: a sharp fall in the vacancy rate for warehouses of over 100,000 square feet. The national vacancy rate is about 6%, and is as low as 3% in some areas of London and the South East.  One industry rule of thumb holds that a vacancy rate of under 10% is a catalyst for rising rents.(So this is one example of a sector that is probably benefitting from uncertainty around Brexit. Indeed, there are signs that speculative development is starting to pick up as some scent an opportunity.)Still, some car manufacturers have told Newsnight that there isn't enough warehousing space near their factories to be fully ready for a no-deal Brexit. And perhaps that isn't surprising, given the scale involved. Honda has estimated that holding the required nine days of supply would require a warehouse the size of 42 football pitches, according to the FT. Other sectors may also find themselves tight. Specialist types of space - like cold storage for frozen foods - tend to be in shorter supply. NewCold, a company focused on frozen supply chain logistics, says it has started to receive Brexit-related demands for space, including from food companies wanting to increase stocks of food in the first half of next year. It has left a 'Brexit buffer' in its recently-expanded Wakefield facility and is planning to build another site further south once an anchor tenant is secured. Greater trade friction, delays at ports and airports, a rethink of international supply chains. Many of the potential knock-on effects from Brexit have something in common: they require space. And the UK may find itself wanting more of it in a hurry. "
2018-09-25,Immigration debate,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925213615/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45638048,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBy BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg and BBC Political Correspondent Iain WatsonFor swathes of voters, immigration was the biggest question in the referendum campaign. But details of what to do about it after Brexit have been slow in coming. But ministers took a big step towards how the future system will look, with the biggest reboot of the immigration system in decades. The Cabinet on Monday agreed in principle that after Brexit EU nationals and people from other parts of the world should face the same immigration rules if they want to come to live or work in the UK. Ministers discussed proposals at length around the cabinet table and heard a presentation from the chair of the Migration Advisory Committee, Professor Alan Manning. Ministers reached what sources described as a ""high-level conclusion"" that after Brexit people wanting to come to live or work in the UK should be subject to the same rules, wherever they are from. There was broad agreement on that principle, and the Home Office will now spend weeks working out further details. But the precise details in a future White Paper might not emerge until after a deal is reached with the EU in November.One insider told the BBC that the system would be based on ""skills not nationality"". Although free movement for EU nationals would end, government sources suggest there could still be ""light touch migration"" from the EU as part of a wider trade deal but they say the EU would not get ""something for nothing"" and there would have to be the same access for British citizens in Europe.They said that would not be ""preferential treatment"" because other future trade partners, for example the United States, could be offered the same kind of thing. In the Chequers agreement there is provision for a so-called ""mobility partnerships"" with the EU.It is understood that the Business Secretary Greg Clark raised the prospect of concerns from business at a sudden change, arguing that there could be pressure for a gradual, rather than an immediate, shake-up after Brexit.The Chancellor Philip Hammond agreed that was likely. But sources are adamant that the chancellor did not push for a delay and that there was a unanimous decision to move to a new system based on the principle of equal access. But the cabinet did accept that some sectors would need low-skilled migrants from the EU. If there is no deal, insiders have admitted that the new migration system won't be ready and would have to be ""tapered in"".EU citizens coming to the UK would have to apply for a work visa after they had arrived. Another cabinet source suggested however that no final decisions had been made. It's been suggested that the prime minister hopes to make an announcement about new immigration rules at the Tory conference next week. "
2018-09-25,Brexit: What happens next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925213615/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45601502,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has warned that the Brexit negotiations are at an impasse and there will be no progress until the EU treats her proposals seriously.She has accused EU leaders of showing the UK a lack of respect after they rebuffed her Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit without, she said, any alternative or explanation. With the clock counting down to the UK's scheduled exit on 29 March 2019, where does this latest row leave the chances of a deal and what could happen next in the Brexit process?Mrs May has said the two sides remain ""a long way"" apart on the crucial issues of how the UK will trade with the EU after Brexit and the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.She reiterated again her belief that her Chequers blueprint was the only way of properly implementing Brexit and also ensuring a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU in the future. Please upgrade your browserThe PM has also rejected the two options put on the table by the EU - a Norway-style association agreement and a much looser relationship based on Canada's trade deal with the EU. For its part, the EU has said the Chequers plan is unworkable as it fragments the single market. The next few weeks will be crucial if these differences are to be resolved and the two sides are to fulfil their shared aim of an orderly Brexit and an outline agreement on trade, security and other issues. Mrs May has suffered plenty of Brexit setbacks in the past and soldiered but many of her own MPs don't think she is going about the process of leaving the EU the right way.The number of Tories who say they won't vote for the Chequers plan seems to be growing by the day and, remember, any deal she negotiates with the EU has to get through Parliament.There is enormous pressure from the Brexiteer-wing of the party for her to rip up Chequers and throw her weight behind an enhanced version of Canada's 2016 deal with the EU.The so-called Canada Plus Plus option, which removes most customs duties on goods but without paying for access to the single market, is backed by Boris Johnson, David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg, among others, who believe the UK Parliament will vote for it.Many Conservative Remainers, like former minister Justine Greening, have also lost faith in Chequers and think there should be a referendum (more of that later) while some Tories think the UK may well end up in a temporary European Economic Area-style arrangement, sometimes called the Norway option. This would mean accepting the free movement of people and the indirect recognition of European Court of Justice rulings - but would allow businesses access to the EU single market, with some strings attached.Amid speculation about further cabinet resignations if she persists with Chequers, calls for the PM to think again are likely to reach a crescendo at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham.If the PM does not shift on the substance of her Chequers plan, expect much frenzied talk of leadership challenges.Salzburg may have caused a dust-up but it hasn't changed the underlying reality that both sides want as amicable a divorce as possible.Some Tory MPs favour a clean break with the EU, which would see the UK fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization, the global body governing international trade, but they are in a minority.Both sides are ramping up talk of no-deal contingency planning.But they also know that such an outcome would be seen as a political failure and a disaster for business - particularly as the 21-month transition period planned after Brexit day would be scrapped.A summit on 18-19 October of EU leaders was, for a long time, pencilled in as the moment that the two sides would have to look each other in the eye and reach a deal.However, this is not now seen as feasible and the focus is on a special one-off summit that has been arranged for mid-November.An agreement then, the thinking goes, would still allow enough time for the UK and European Parliaments and a supermajority of European states - that's 20 out of 27 - to ratify any deal before the 29 March deadline.So, the clock is ticking but the EU is renowned for finalising deals at the 11th hour and it wouldn't be the first time the talks have seemed on the brink of collapse only for a deal to be pulled out of the fire. If she brings a deal back from Brussels, Theresa May has another big hurdle to negotiate. She must persuade Parliament to back it, in a vote likely before the end of the year or in early 2019.Tory Brexiteers opposed to Chequers have suggested up to 80 MPs would be prepared to vote against it. Although we don't know what the final deal will look like and the size of any rebellion would, in all likelihood, be much smaller, even a dozen Conservatives defying the leadership would risk defeat for the PM, with her non-existent Commons majority.The opposition parties are unlikely to come to the PM's aid, with Labour saying any deal is unlikely to pass its six tests guaranteeing workers' rights and all the ""benefits"" of the single market and customs union.The Labour leadership is hoping to inflict a defeat as a way of triggering a general election.It is written into law that the UK will be leaving at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019, two years to the day after the government notified the EU of its intention to quit, by triggering Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty. But if there is no deal or Parliament rejects the deal, we are in uncharted territory and it is impossible to say with any certainty what will happen next.Mrs May has insisted the 2016 referendum result will not be overturned but if Parliament cannot agree on what kind of Brexit it wants, a fresh public vote might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. But how could this happen?Should Mrs May lose a vote on her deal, she could conceivably resign and her successor may use his or her new mandate to seek Commons approval for a vote on another referendum.Alternatively, MPs who back a so-called People's Vote - which include the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, Plaid Cymru as well as a growing number of Labour MPs - could seek to table a backbench amendment to the legislation that has been promised to implement the UK's withdrawal.With most Tories, so far, publicly opposed to a referendum, any vote is likely to be extremely tight. Either way, Parliament would then need to pass enabling legislation, similar to the 2015 European Referendum Act, setting out the date of the poll, the question and the franchise, as well as other details.  As it stands, if no deal has been agreed by 21 January 2019, ministers will be required to make a statement to Parliament about the next steps. This could trigger the mother of parliamentary battles over Brexit.Some European leaders believe Brexit can be halted but unless Mrs May or her successor and the other 27 nations agree to extend the two-year Article 50 process beyond 29 March, this cannot legally happen. Critics say there won't be enough time while there is also another stumbling block in that those who back a vote do not all agree on what question should be asked on the ballot paper.While the People's Vote campaign wants the option to remain, the Labour leadership has said it should be on the terms of the deal - in other words between leaving with Mrs May's deal or no deal.What Labour really wants is a general election so it can take over the negotiations. It is only after 29 March that discussions about future co-operation - including a trade deal - will really begin in earnest. "
2018-09-25,De-selection row,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925213615/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45621357,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSo what was Sunday's row over MP deselections at the Labour Party conference really all about?First, it speaks to the increasing tensions within the party's left wing on how best to solidify the changes Jeremy Corbyn has introduced.The left wing group Momentum wanted to see ""open selections"" where sitting MPs - many of whom didn't vote for Mr Corbyn as their leader - could be challenged between elections.Until now, this could only happen if 50% of local party branches agree.But although most unions are under left wing leadership they wanted to ensure they had a say in the process.So behind closed doors at Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) last night, a compromise was agreed.It will be easier to deselect MPs. Indeed, the Unite leader Len McCluskey had to emphasise just how easy it would be, in order to assuage angry delegates. However, a third of union or local party branches will have to agree to pull the trigger on the starting gun for any contest. It won't be automatic.But what upset many left wing delegates was what they saw as an old fashioned stitch-up worthy of the Blair era.They were given a straight choice between accepting or rejecting the NEC compromise - and no opportunity to vote for open selections.That's why they very nearly threw out the whole conference agenda in protest.Which brings us to the second point: the row tells us that there are now far more delegates on the left of the party than in previous years, even after Jeremy Corbyn became leader.This is underlined by the fact that while the Momentum leadership is now backing the deselection compromise as a step forward, some of their own supporters see this as a sell out. Nonetheless, Momentum will come together again to harry for further change in the years ahead.And in doing so, the friction between the political and industrial wings of this new-look Labour is likely to increase."

2018-09-25,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925213615/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK but talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan, which was the UK's official view of a proposed Brexit deal.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May held an awayday for the cabinet at her country residence - Chequers - in July. At this gathering a favoured UK position for Brexit talks was agreed. It included proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals and says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland.

The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-25,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180925213615/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-09-26,Labour is 'ready' to govern - Corbyn,https://web.archive.org//web/20180926144545/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45646690,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour is ""ready"" to start work on a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"", Jeremy Corbyn has told his party conference.The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture that has dominated politics and ""kickstart a green jobs revolution"".""We represent the new common sense of our time,"" Mr Corbyn told the Labour faithful in Liverpool.Labour is hoping to force a general election within months.Mr Corbyn spoke for more than an hour, setting out his vision for a ""fairer society under Labour"" to enthusiastic support in the hall. ""When we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government. Investing in Britain after years of austerity and neglect and bringing our country together after a decade of division,"" he told delegates, to cheers.He told them ""the old way of running things isn't working anymore"" and Labour's better-than-expected election result last year showed voters were ready for something new.""Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.""But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.""People in this country know - they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn't working any more."" Labour members voted on Tuesday to keep all options on the table - including a fresh referendum - if there is no Brexit deal with Brussels.Mr Corbyn said in his speech he would support Theresa May on Brexit - if she got a ""sensible"" deal that included a customs union that prevented the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland and protected workers' rights.He said Labour would vote against the PM's Chequers plan ""or whatever is left of it"" and oppose leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would be a ""national disaster"".But he told Mrs May: ""If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people's rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. ""A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.""But if you can't negotiate that deal then you need to make way for a party that can and will.""This call, delivered with venom by Mr Corbyn, went down well in the hall. Delegates gave their leader a standing ovation and there was an outbreak of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"".Mrs May has consistently ruled out a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader also used his speech to announce plans to create 400,000 skilled jobs with new investment in fresh wind farms and insulation for homes.He pointed to Labour's commitment to reduce the UK's net carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 - and to zero by 2050.Labour's energy plans would ""make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations"", said Mr Corbyn.And they would bring ""skills and security to communities held back for too long"", in all parts of the UK.Turning to the row over anti-Semitism in Labour, Mr Corbyn said it had caused ""immense hurt and anxiety"" and there was a standing ovation as he told Jewish people: ""We are your ally.""Being anti-racist was ""integral to our very being"", he went on, adding that he would not accept being accused of anti-Semitism by ""Tory hypocrites"", criticising the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and MEPs' ""support"" for the Hungarian government of Viktor Orban.On foreign policy, Mr Corbyn said evidence ""now points clearly to the Russian state"" as being responsible for the Salisbury poisoning and promised ""no more reckless wars of intervention"" like those in Iraq and Libya.And he condemned the actions of Israeli forces in Gaza, calling for a ""secure Israel and a viable and secure Palestinian state"".Labour would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it takes office, he said, ""in order to help make that two-state settlement a reality"".Earlier in his speech, to applause in the arena, he attacked parts of the British press, saying billionaire newspapers owners did not like Labour ""one little bit"".He called on supporters to challenge their ""propaganda of privilege"", using ""the mass media of the 21st century"" - social media.Freedom of the press must be protected, he said: ""But here, a free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful.""Mr Corbyn said Labour would put ""fairness and humanity"" back into public services, pointing to pledges to increase the number of police officers and expand free childcare.Labour has used its week in Liverpool to announce a string of new policies, building on those contained in its 2017 general election manifesto.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell unveiled plans to force large companies to give staff 1% of their shares a year, netting them up to Â£500 a year each.He also set out plans to ""democratise"" the economy by renationalising the water industry, which he said would hand power to workers, consumers and local councils. Further nationalisations - of the rail, mail and energy industries - would follow under a Labour government.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the speech showed Mr Corbyn ""was unfit to govern"" and would ""open the door to re-running the referendum"".The CBI business group's director general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was ""much common ground between business and Labour"" but warned that ""continual public barbs and backward-facing policy are deterring entrepreneurs and investors, at a time when we need them most"".Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""That speech was inspiring. We heard a Labour leader draw a very clear line under the failed policies of the past, policies that have caused despair and division in our communities, and then set out a distinctive, different, positive Labour programme for the country.""The British Chambers of Commerce said there were some ""bright spots"" but ""Jeremy Corbyn missed a golden opportunity to extend an olive branch to British business""."

A general election,"" she said.""Comrades, we must topple this cruel and callous Tory government as soon as we can. And if we can't get a general election, we should organise with our brothers and sisters in the trade unions to bring an end to this government with a general strike.""After the crowd rose to their feet in applause, she added: ""That went better than I thought it would've gone.""Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Watson said: ""Well, it's not particularly helpful, but she is a new MP and she was at a big fringe event - nothing to do with the party organisation - and I'm sure she got a little bit carried away.""Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said: ""Laura is an absolutely amazing MP, she's one of the North West MPs with myself, she's so full of energy and enthusiasm, but we're certainly not advocating general strikes as Labour Party policy.""She added: ""Just to make it perfectly clear a general strike is not Labour Party policy."""

""I again pressed for Nazanin's swift release - she deserves to be back at home with her family,"" Mr Hunt said in a statement.He said it was ""not acceptable to detain innocent people arbitrarily at the cost of enormous human anguish"".Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016 after visiting her family on holiday.

""She's calmer than she was before,"" he told the Today programme.He described ""the shock of being let out but then being brought back in, which was really tough for a week or so"". But he added: ""Things have really calmed, and (we are) just hoping beyond hope that the government can unlock something.""Labour MP Tulip Siddiq welcomed the prime minister's intervention, saying her constituent had ""been through hell and back"".3 weeks ago I publicly asked the PM to raise the case of my constituent Nazanin with President Rouhani at the UN general assembly.

2018-09-26,What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180926144545/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45633592,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFree trade comes in many forms.It ranges from single markets to customs unions, to association agreements, to free trade agreements (FTAs) and beyond.The EU has negotiated 35 trade agreements for its member states, with another 22 pending.But it says ""the most ambitious trade agreement that the EU has ever concluded"" is with Canada.It's called the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA).Signed in October 2016, it provisionally came into force last September. The only remaining step is for all the countries to ratify it, which could take several years.But exporters and importers have been working under its rules for a year, and many now believe the CETA model could be a template for the UK's trading relationship with the EU after Brexit.Some 98% of all tariffs on goods traded between Canada and the EU have become duty free. Most tariffs were removed when the agreement came into force a year ago. All will be removed within seven years.It means Canadian importers will not have to pay â¬590m (Â£529m) in taxes on the goods they receive from the EU, and European importers will see tariffs reduced to zero on some 9,000 Canadian products. The EU and Canada will open up public contracts at local, regional and federal levels to each other's contractors - that means Canadian companies, say, pitching to build French railways or British builders bidding to construct an Ontario school.It protects EU ""geographical indications"", meaning you can only make prosciutto di Parma ham in Italy and camembert cheese in France, and Canada can't import something that calls itself camembert from any other country inside or outside the EU.These are the kinds of changes CETA brought in:It offers more protection for intellectual property rights. So for instance a European artist can obtain royalties from a Vancouver cafe or department store that plays music to attract new customers.The EU and Canada will co-operate on standards, so that a piece of equipment made in an EU country can go through all its safety and quality checks there without needing to have them repeated in Canada - and vice versa.CETA will also allow professional qualifications to be recognised both in Canada and the EU, making it easier, for example, for architects or accountants to work in both places.It is not a customs union or single market so the two parties are free to do trade deals with any other country.It does not remove border controls, but it encourages the use of advanced electronic checking to speed customs clearance.CETA does little for trade in financial services that is not covered by World Trade Organization rules that both sides are already signed up to.Canadian financial companies will not get ""passporting"", which would allow them to sell their products across the 28 nations of the EU. The same limitations apply for EU banks in Canada.Tariffs will remain on poultry, meat and eggs. Several other agri-products will be given quotas. For instance, the EU will allow Canadians to export increasing amounts of duty-free meat to the EU - up to 80,000 tonnes of pork, 50,000 tonnes of beef - as well as 100,000 tonnes of wheat.But the EU insists those products meet its quality standards - so that's no hormone-treated beef, and tightly controlled GM cereals. Politicians like it, some businesses are taking advantage of it but a lot of civil liberties and environmental groups are less happy.Critics argue it will erode labour laws, not enforce environmental standards and allow multinational companies to dictate public policy. CETA does change the way trade disputes are settled, using a new type of tribunal, the Investment Court System (ICS). But not everyone is convinced. Protesters took to the streets in Brussels as the deal was about to be signed. The French-speaking Walloon region of Belgium brought the whole process to a virtual halt by objecting to the way dispute settlement procedures were to be conducted. Even now Italy has threatened not to ratify it because it claims it does not sufficiently protect some of its ""geographical indications"". The threat could theoretically scupper the deal but the European Commission has said as a last resort it may settle the matter in court. Meanwhile the EU (including Italy) and Canada have been trading under the terms of CETA for over a year.There are big differences between the EU-Canada and the EU-UK trading relationship.Firstly, there is a difference in the value of goods and services traded.Only 10% of Canada's external trade goes to the EU. Total trade between the two is worth about C$85bn (Â£50bn).About 43% of UK external trade is with the EU. It is the UK's biggest trading partner. Total trade between the two is worth about Â£318bn.In addition, the nature of the trade is very different.Canada's main trade with the EU is in precious stones and metals, machinery, mineral ores, mineral fuels and oils, aircraft, aircraft parts and pharmaceuticals. Agri-food trade between the two amounts to about Â£5bn.Canada's services exports amounted to Â£11bn and were largely in management, research and development (R&D,) financial and IT services. In contrast, the UK exports Â£27bn in financial services alone to the EU, and a total of Â£90bn in all services. Agri-food trade between the UK and the EU amounts to about Â£30bn.The UK exports goods worth Â£236bn to the EU across a wider range of industries than Canada. Motor vehicles and parts worth Â£18bn are the largest single sector followed by chemicals and chemical products worth Â£15bn.It is early days but most observers say it's good for business.Exports to the EU during the six months to July rose about 6% on the same period a year earlier, to C$19.7bn (Â£11.6bn), according to Statistics Canada.Jim Carr, Canada's Minister of International Trade Diversification said: ""At the Port of Montreal alone, we have seen 20% more traffic in goods headed across the Atlantic.""This enormous step in growth for Canada and the EU has been the reason why new shipping lanes have been added to accommodate container traffic.""The European Commission is equally ebullient about the deal, pointing out the successes of small companies such as Belgium's Smet Chocolaterie which is opening shops across Canada, or Italy's San Daniele ham producers who have increased sales to Canada by 35%.It estimates exports to Canada are up by over 7% year-on-year."

""That includes campaigning for a public vote,"" he said.""It is right for Parliament to have the first say but if we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option.""Please upgrade your browserMonday saw confusion over whether the leadership thought any fresh referendum should include staying in the EU as an option.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he thought any vote should be on the terms of a Brexit deal - rather than on remaining in the EU.But he later said ""all options"" were on the table - a point reinforced by Sir Keir.Labour - which wants the UK to remain in a customs union but not the single market - has not ruled out voting for any deal Mrs May brings back from Brussels, ahead of the UK's 29 March departure date. But Sir Keir said the six tests his party has set - including guarantees on workers' rights and retaining the economic benefits of existing market arrangements - were unlikely to be met.""Some have said Labour could vote for any deal the Tories reach. Some have said we may abstain. Some have said we may vote for a vague deal,"" he said.""So, let me be very clear - right here, right now: if Theresa May brings back a deal that does not meet our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts. ""And if the prime minister thinks we'll wave through a vague deal asking us to leap blindfolded into the unknown, she can think again.""But Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said any vote on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations could not be a re-run of the 2016 in-out referendum.""Despite what Keir said earlier, it's a public vote on the terms of our departure,"" he said. ""We desperately need a better, fairer society - we need to heal the wounds of Brexit, not reopen them, and only our movement, united with a proud socialist government, is capable of doing that.""The Labour Leave campaign group, which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum, said Sir Keir was ""playing with fire"" and talk of a referendum made Labour look like ""the party of Remain"". ""We're damaging the Labour brand and alienating our supporters,"" said its general secretary Brendan Chilton.""We have already had a vote on the UK's membership of the EU; it's been done and dusted. The Labour Party and its members must accept this and move on.""The prime minister's Chequers plan, which would see the UK staying closely aligned to the EU in some areas, such as the trade in goods, has been criticised by EU leaders and many of her own MPs.The Conservatives accused Labour of ""playing political games"".""Labour seem determined to take us all back to square one by rejecting a deal out of hand then trying to delay Brexit and re-run the referendum,"" said Brexit minister Robin Walker.

2018-09-26,Ex-minister 'told lies' over green scheme,https://web.archive.org//web/20180926144545/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45637799,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe DUP's director of communications has accused a former ministerial colleague of telling lies about the handling of Northern Ireland's flawed green energy scheme.John Robinson made the claim about ex-DUP Enterprise Minister Jonathan Bell.He was speaking at the inquiry into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme.It was set up in 2012 to encourage uptake of eco-friendly heat systems, but overgenerous fuel subsidies left NI taxpayers with a Â£490m bill.The scheme's failings led to the establishment of a public inquiry in January 2017.It was during that time that Mr Bell named Mr Robinson in the NI Assembly as one of two DUP advisers who wanted to delay cost controls to the scheme because their families had ""extensive interests in the poultry sector"".Poultry farmers made up the majority of RHI claimants.Mr Robinson told the inquiry that Mr Bell's claim was completely untrue.He said none of his immediate family had boilers and that when he was named by Mr Bell, he was ""as shocked as anyone"".He told the panel the claim was ""hurtful"" and that it catapulted his family into a media spotlight they did not deserve.""Jonathan told lies, he knows he told lies and I'll just leave it at that,"" he said.Although none of his immediate family are on the RHI scheme, Mr Robinson's father-in-law is a claimant, having applied in August 2015.Mr Robinson said he did not discuss the RHI scheme with his father-in-law and that neither he nor his wife had any role or benefit in his in-laws' farming business.In his witness statement, published on Tuesday, Mr Robinson said he ""regretted"" not seeking an opportunity to make his party aware of his relatives' connection to the scheme earlier.""I accept that some may have perceived this as a conflict of interest with my work as a special adviser,"" he added.He was asked about that perceived conflict of interest at the inquiry on Wednesday.By the time Mr Robinson came to work in the economy department as a special adviser in May 2016, the scheme had been closed - but officials were still working to address the huge budgetary overspend.Mr Robinson said he regretted not signing a written declaration of interest when he first told then Economy Minister Simon Hamilton about his father-in-law's link to the scheme in July 2016.Mr Robinson said he and Mr Hamilton decided that as he was not a decision-maker, it was not necessary to take any further steps such as informing the civil service.He said that was a mistake, and had he taken further steps he would have been in a ""a much more defensible position"" when the media asked him questions about his links to the scheme.The inquiry also heard there was no mechanism for an adviser to make a declaration of interest until the form was created in December 2016.Inquiry counsel Donal Lunny asked Mr Robinson if he could see the potential for a perceived conflict of interest.Mr Robinson said he could, but added that he had no knowledge of RHI.After his family connection to the scheme became public knowledge, Mr Robinson stepped aside from advising Simon Hamilton on RHI issues. Mr Lunny put it to Mr Robinson that he only stood aside on RHI matters when the story broke to attempt to address building ""political pressure"", rather than the perceived conflict of interest.Mr Robinson said he could see why people might think that, but insisted he stepped aside in order to allow the focus to remain on fixing the scheme.When the assembly dissolved for the upcoming election in March 2017, sparked by the RHI scandal, he lost his adviser job.But Mr Robinson returned to his previous role as the DUP's director of press communications.On Wednesday afternoon, another former DUP special adviser appeared at the RHI inquiry for the first time.It has already emerged that Stephen Brimstone is a claimant on the scheme, as is his brother, Aaron.Mr Brimstone, who replaced a boiler in a shed at his home in order to get on the non-domestic RHI scheme, told the inquiry he wishes he had ""never come across"" the scheme.He had a biomass boiler in his shed for a number of years, but said he began looking to replace it in late 2014 after experiencing maintenance problems.He found out about the RHI scheme, which by that point had been operating for about two years.Mr Brimstone submitted an application in August 2015, when he was adviser to a DUP junior minister.The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) - the scheme's administrator - has confirmed that his application was valid under RHI rules.The inquiry was told Mr Brimstone's usage fell within the scheme's rules and that he was not running the boiler to heat his home and shed 24 hours a day.He also said he had never heard of anyone attempting to manipulate the scheme for profit - although the inquiry has heard evidence that experts warned government officials about that possibility.Mr Brimstone's application was approved in April 2016, when he was advising then First Minister Arlene Foster, but he received payments backdated to when he applied.He told the inquiry he would have gone back to using an oil heating system for his property had the biomass RHI scheme, which brought with it an attractive financial incentive, not been available. ""I wish I had done now,"" he said.""I'm sure you do, but you didn't,"" said inquiry counsel Joseph Aiken.The inquiry heard at the time Mr Brimstone was replacing his system, the cost of wood pellets had risen and there was more maintenance with a biomass boiler.The former adviser said he wished he had ""never come across"" the lucrative RHI scheme, and admitted had it not been on offer, he would have ditched renewable heat.Later, Mr Brimstone told the inquiry he ""thoroughly regrets"" not withdrawing himself from a conversation with two DUP advisers about plans to introduce cost controls to the scheme in summer 2015.He said he should have stepped back from the conversation and made his colleagues aware that there could have been a ""perceived conflict of interest"".""That's what you should have done and you didn't do,"" Mr Aiken said.""Absolutely,"" replied Mr Brimstone.In his witness statement to the inquiry, he said he told Arlene Foster ""only for information purposes"" in January 2016 that he had applied to the scheme, as he was then advising her in the first minister's office.She has said Mr Brimstone's link to the scheme was not a factor in his decision to quit his job as a special adviser in late 2016.Mr Brimstone has been in the public eye before: he was an aide to former social development minister Nelson McCausland, during which time he became entangled in a housing maintenance scandal.He is due to give evidence to the inquiry again on Thursday.On Friday, the inquiry will hear from another former DUP special adviser, Timothy Johnston, who is now the party's chief executive."

I'm not sure I would fancy popping in for a quick one at the local if I saw her pulling pints at the bar.""Following the commissioner's decision, Ms Watson, the AM for Mid and West Wales, wrote to him saying: ""You do not find it to be 'sexist or misogynistic'. ""I appreciate that you are not the 'arbiter of the level of political debate'. ""However, I maintain that the video falls outside the parameters of robust debate - and that the allusion to 'buxom barmaids' is inherently sexist.

The annual survey of international education published by the OECD showed this year that head teachers in the UK were among the best paid in the world - with only those in Luxembourg earning more.Among the areas where heads are taking part in the protest are: Blackpool, Bolton, Brighton and Hove, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cornwall, Cumbria, Derbyshire, Devon, Dorset, Dudley, East Sussex, Essex, Gloucestershire, Greenwich, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Kent, Kingston-upon-Thames, Lancashire, Liverpool, London, Norfolk, Northampton, Oxfordshire, Peterborough, Poole, Portsmouth, Richmond, Rotherham, Sheffield, Slough, Solihull, Somerset, Southend, Southampton, Staffordshire, Suffolk, Surrey, Thurrock, Walsall, Warrington, West Berkshire, West Sussex, Wigan, Wiltshire, Wokingham, Wolverhampton, Worcestershire."

Driving up standards of childcare will make that vital difference for millions of our children.""Households where a parent earns more than Â£100,000 are also not currently eligible for free child care.Labour say the plans will cost Â£4.5bn.It would be paid for, a spokesman said, by ""taxes on the top 5% of earners and big companies"".CBI deputy director general Josh Hardie said: ""Business has long called for support to parents to make childcare more affordable. ""The challenge will be to find ways to fund affordable childcare sustainably and sensibly. The prize will be significant for working families across the UK and can play a serious role in reducing the gender pay gap.""Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi, responding for the Conservatives, said it was another ""unfunded promise"" from Mr Corbyn."
2018-09-26,Edinburgh tourist tax could be Â£2 a night,https://web.archive.org//web/20180926144545/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-45643915,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEdinburgh City Council plans to launch a consultation on its plans to charge a tourist tax of Â£2 per room, per night.It said the tax would raise an extra Â£11m a year, to be spent on growing tourism and managing its impact.The council has published details of its proposals for a Transient Visitor Levy ahead of the consultation that will last until the end of the year.Opponents have attacked the plans and claim there has been no ""meaningful engagement"" with the tourism industry.The local authority is suggesting a year-round charge of either 2% or Â£2 per room, per night, for all types of accommodation.This would include short-term lets and would be capped at seven nights. Edinburgh is at the forefront of a push from many of Scotland's local authorities to be given power by ministers to introduce the visitor's levy.The Scottish government has said it would not consider it unless the long-term interests of the industry were fully recognised.Respondents to the consultation will also be asked about the size of the charge, what types of accommodation should be covered, whether it should be seasonal or all-year-round and whether it should be capped. The council also wants people to give their views on priorities for how the additional money would be spent.Key principles for the tax are:Council leader Adam McVey said: ""Our work over the summer has focused on key stakeholders, particularly those in the hospitality trade, and we are continuing to engage with them on the details of what an Edinburgh scheme could reasonably look like and options for implementing it. ""Public consultation will allow for a wider and transparent debate over important details with everyone who has a view and we believe this approach is an important component of gaining trust and support for the scheme.""However, tourism sector bosses under the banner of the Scottish Tourism Alliance said the level of engagement had been inadequate.In a statement, they said: ""The Scottish Tourism Alliance is disappointed that Edinburgh City Council has proceeded to launch a consultation on its plans to charge a tourist tax of Â£2 per room, per night, having had no formal or meaningful engagement with Scotland's tourism industry to date.""The Scottish government has been consistent in its position that it has no plans for a tax on tourists and that the interests of the hospitality and tourism industry must be fully taken into account through consultation.""The STA said it was pushing for a formal consultation at a national level, initiated by the Scottish government, on the idea of a tourist tax.Research, commissioned by Marketing Edinburgh, which saw 519 interviews with Edinburgh residents and 561 interviews with paying overnight visitors - 10% from Scotland, 35% from elsewhere in the UK and 56% overseas - found broad support for the move.The research found that a small nightly charge would not deter visitors from going to Edinburgh and that residents were supportive of the idea.All of Scotland's 31 other local authorities have backed calls for the powers necessary to implement a TVL.

On Monday, the cabinet agreed that EU citizens should face the same migration rules as those from elsewhere.Theresa May's ministers unanimously supported a system based on skills rather than nationality, following a lengthy meeting in Downing Street.The prime minister has repeatedly vowed to end unlimited immigration from Europe after Brexit but some fear that any ban on low-skilled EU migrants may damage business.Speaking en route to New York for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, Mrs May said the interests of businesses and the concerns of the public had to be balanced.""People voted to bring an end to free movement and we will do that,"" she said.""As we look at the future proposals for our immigration rules what we want to do is to ensure that we are recognising the concerns that people have about immigration; that we are working to continue to bring net migration down but obviously that we do that in a way that is good for the British economy.""Monday's cabinet agreement came after a presentation from the MAC chairman, Prof Alan Manning, at a lengthy meeting.According to one source, the principle was agreed that the UK would not show bias towards immigrants from any one part of the world over another when granting access to work.However, one cabinet source told the BBC the agreement did not constitute a firm decision and a government source said there could be ""light touch migration"" rules for EU nationals as part of any wider Brexit trade deal.The government does not call this ""preferential"" treatment because a similar arrangement could be struck with, for example, the US as part of a UK-US trade deal.The EU's principle of freedom of movement currently allows people from the European Economic Area - all EU countries, as well as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - plus Switzerland, to travel and work within the area without visas, regardless of skills.Anyone wanting to move to the UK from outside the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, to work or study needs to apply for one of a number of visas.These range from Tier 1, preserved for investors and ""exceptional talent"", to Tier 5 visas for short-term voluntary and educational programmes.The two most common are the Tier 2 skilled worker visas and Tier 4 student visas. Currently, no Tier 3 - unskilled labour - visas are being given out.Some of these visas allow people to apply to bring dependants such as children and partners.Visas work on a points-based system and the criteria have got tougher in recent years.For example, for a Tier 2 ""experienced skilled worker"" visa, people now need to be paid at least Â£30,000 to apply, up almost Â£10,000 from 2011. People get more points for higher salaries or if their job is on the list of shortage occupations.Most visas come with other conditions, including knowledge of English, the need for a sponsor and agreeing not to claim benefits for a period of time.Last week, the Migration Advisory Committee, an independent public body which advises ministers on migration issues, called for the annual limit on the number of high-skilled workers from outside the EU granted permission to work to be scrapped.Currently set at 20,700 a year, the cap - imposed by Mrs May when at the Home Office - has resulted in thousands of IT specialists and NHS candidates being denied visas.Please upgrade your browserThe UK is due to withdraw from the European Union on 29 March next year, although an ""implementation period"" lasting until 31 December 2020 has been agreed as part of the proposed Brexit deal being negotiated between the UK and the EU.In that transition period, EU citizens arriving in the UK would enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive beforehand. The same would apply to UK expats on the continent.It remains unclear what would happen in the event of a ""no-deal"" Brexit, as the transition period would not then happen and the new migration system would, government sources say, have to be ""tapered in"" because it would not be ready by March."

The Labour leader has left the platform after his fourth keynote conference speech. And it was classic comfort zone Corbyn, cheered by party members, explaining his core belief that Britain is not fair, and that a bigger state with Labour at the helm is the way to fix it. We heard some of his greatest hits for party members - criticisms of the Tories' links to billionaires, huge cheers for his staunch defence of Palestinian rights, long passages about how the economy, in his view, is dramatically skewed towards the wealthy, that promise to expand childcare, green energy, and to build more social housing. There was also an important request to the conference floor for more tolerance of each other, a plea to ""shout less and listen more"", with an admission of the hurt the row over anti-Semitism has caused Jews, although there was no apology for what's gone wrong. And in his final flourish, he reiterated the demand he has made previously in Westminster, that if Theresa May can't get a decent deal from the EU, she ought to ""get out of the way"", and give Labour a shot at power. There is no change in the party's policy, but Mr Corbyn does not want to be seen as if he is trying to block Brexit, so he made clear that if the prime minister can meet Labour's conditions, they will vote for her deal. Except, remember, few right now believe that will happen. And only yesterday the message that went far and wide from the conference was that the party is preparing to vote down the deal. Insiders suggest he is trying to throw the gauntlet down to the prime minister ahead of what will almost inevitably be a torrid week at her party conference. The Labour conference is more at ease with itself this year, and this speech was designed to show the rest of the country that that party has solid, credible, worked-out answers for the questions of the day. Scepticism about his programme still runs far and wide in the parliamentary party at Westminster.But this Liverpool gathering has more or less, despite tensions over the EU, shown that Labour has moved on from the turmoil when Mr Corbyn first took over. Party conferences are always a shop window for leaders to show their wares to the rest of the country. Labour's top team is convinced, completely, that the country has moved to the left since the crash, that sentiment is shifting towards a desire for a bigger state, for a new settlement.   Today, Mr Corbyn tried to portray himself as the definer of what he described as ""new common sense"".  Ultimately of course, it's voters that get to decide. "
2018-09-26,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180926144545/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45640548,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowShadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed the Labour Party is preparing to vote against whatever deal Theresa May brings back from negotiations with the European Union. What is Labour's Brexit policy, and what does it think should happen next?First of all, Labour says the government's Brexit proposals are failing to meet the six tests that Labour set out last year.Labour says these are the tests against which it will judge any final Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May's government, as part of the Article 50 negotiations on leaving the EU. They are: Labour has now published a report, which says all six of the tests are ""on course to be failed"".""Let me be very clear - right here, right now,"" Sir Keir told the BBC. ""If Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts.""But there are buts. When you look at the tests it is hardly surprising that they are on course to be failed, because of the way Labour set them out in the first place, as a way to judge the final Brexit deal. What is being negotiated between the UK and the EU now is the withdrawal agreement - the terms of divorce, rather than the precise detail of the future relationship. So it's not the final deal, and that makes some of the tests rather hard to assess fully at this stage. Take test number one: does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the EU? No-one can ensure that at the moment, and we probably won't know for sure until long after we've left. If a deal on a withdrawal agreement is done, it will be accompanied by a non-binding political declaration, which will presumably gush enthusiastically about a strong partnership in the future. Please upgrade your browserBoth sides want a strong partnership; they will remain neighbours. But the details will have to be negotiated later. A political declaration would set the tone and give some detail, but it could still lead to a blind Brexit: in other words, leaving without knowing our final destination.Take test number two: does a deal give the UK the ""exact same benefits"" as membership of the single market and the customs union? Well there's only really one way to achieve the ""exact same benefits"" and that's staying in the single market and the customs union, which is not official Labour policy. Labour says it wants to stay in ""a"" customs union, and stay as close to the single market as possible. That is not the same as membership, so you can argue that even current Labour policy would fail its own test. Labour is keen to emphasise that the six tests are based on promises and commitments the government made about what it would achieve in Brexit negotiations. So this process was certainly a way of holding the government to account. But the tests were also broad enough to cope with divisions within the Labour party about the best way forward. Now, though, the six tests have led to a decisive moment - barring unexpected developments, Labour will vote against a Brexit deal, increasing the chances that it will get rejected. Sir Keir says that's because the government has ""no credible plan"" for Brexit. But does the Labour party have one?Sir Keir confirmed that Labour wanted a general election if the government was defeated in a ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit, although Jeremy Corbyn later said he would also try to send the government back to Brussels to negotiate again.In other words, very little in Labour's Brexit strategy appears to be set in stone. The trouble with the idea of calling for another election is that it's not in Labour's gift. If Prime Minister Theresa May decided to call for an election, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act two-thirds of MPs would have to vote in favour (or go through a no-confidence procedure). And even if a snap election were to take place, it's not clear what would be in a Labour manifesto. Would it include explicit support for another referendum? Would it openly support staying in the single market, even on an interim basis?What we do know is that under the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act, the government would have 21 days to tell Parliament what it intended to do next if MPs rejected a Brexit deal in a ""meaningful vote"". Debates would have to take place in the House of Commons and the House of Lords within seven days. But what would be debated?These are obviously uncharted waters, and it may be up to the Speaker to decide whether any motions to be considered in parliament at that time could be amended, to allow, for example, for MPs to call for another referendum.The government's thinking on the Speaker's role is set out in this Written Ministerial Statement.Pushing for another referendum may well become Labour's main strategy, if it is unable to force an election. In his speech to conference, Sir Keir said the party had to be able to put forward alternatives to leaving the EU with no deal, including - crucially - campaigning for a public vote.   When the shadow Brexit secretary emphasised that nobody was ruling out Remain as an option in such a vote (a remark that was not in the text of the speech distributed to journalists) he received a standing ovation. But not everyone in the party was cheering.Groups like Labour Leave hold a very different view, arguing that ""throwing around the possibility of a second referendum is devastating to the party's brand"". And even within the shadow cabinet there are differences of opinion about the best Brexit strategy to pursue. Leaving the European Union involves big decisions about the way the country is run, bigger than this generation of politicians has faced before. So it is not surprising that the arguments within both Labour and the Conservatives go well beyond traditional party loyalties. But time is running very short for those decisions to be made.

By stuff, I mean parts, raw materials or inventories of finished products. There is a short term and, to a lesser extent, a longer term question here. Given uncertainty about what happens next March when we leave the EU, many businesses may want to have extra supplies on hand in case a disorderly exit leads to disruption at our borders. One estimate put this stockpiling of imports at about Â£40 billion.But longer-term, more bureaucracy, paperwork, checks or delays on imports could also induce companies to keep more (and potentially manufacture more) in the UK.  This would be a much smaller figure - but could vary depending on what exactly the new arrangements are and how confident companies feel that they will to work. And the trouble is, the UK doesn't have much space - specifically warehousing space. We are, according to property company Savills, an ""under-warehoused country"". Our warehousing stock works out to about 7.6 square foot of space per head compared to the US at 39 square foot per head. It is also a market that has been squeezed both on the supply and the demand side. Speculative development - or building a warehouse without a tenant already signed up to take it - fell sharply after the financial crisis started in 2007. Readily-available funding to speculatively build large warehouses and logistics facilities has never really recovered.Meanwhile, the rapacious growth of e-commerce has gobbled up space in recent years. Amazon dominated the market in terms of demand between about 2014 and 2016, according to one expert, and retailing still accounts for about two-thirds of take-up of space. The result is this: a sharp fall in the vacancy rate for warehouses of over 100,000 square feet. The national vacancy rate is about 6%, and is as low as 3% in some areas of London and the South East.  One industry rule of thumb holds that a vacancy rate of under 10% is a catalyst for rising rents.(So this is one example of a sector that is probably benefitting from uncertainty around Brexit. Indeed, there are signs that speculative development is starting to pick up as some scent an opportunity.)Still, some car manufacturers have told Newsnight that there isn't enough warehousing space near their factories to be fully ready for a no-deal Brexit. And perhaps that isn't surprising, given the scale involved. Honda has estimated that holding the required nine days of supply would require a warehouse the size of 42 football pitches, according to the FT. Other sectors may also find themselves tight. Specialist types of space - like cold storage for frozen foods - tend to be in shorter supply. NewCold, a company focused on frozen supply chain logistics, says it has started to receive Brexit-related demands for space, including from food companies wanting to increase stocks of food in the first half of next year. It has left a 'Brexit buffer' in its recently-expanded Wakefield facility and is planning to build another site further south once an anchor tenant is secured. Greater trade friction, delays at ports and airports, a rethink of international supply chains. Many of the potential knock-on effects from Brexit have something in common: they require space. And the UK may find itself wanting more of it in a hurry. "

But details of what to do about it after Brexit have been slow in coming. But ministers took a big step towards how the future system will look, with the biggest reboot of the immigration system in decades. The Cabinet on Monday agreed in principle that after Brexit EU nationals and people from other parts of the world should face the same immigration rules if they want to come to live or work in the UK. Ministers discussed proposals at length around the cabinet table and heard a presentation from the chair of the Migration Advisory Committee, Professor Alan Manning. Ministers reached what sources described as a ""high-level conclusion"" that after Brexit people wanting to come to live or work in the UK should be subject to the same rules, wherever they are from. There was broad agreement on that principle, and the Home Office will now spend weeks working out further details. But the precise details in a future White Paper might not emerge until after a deal is reached with the EU in November.One insider told the BBC that the system would be based on ""skills not nationality"". Although free movement for EU nationals would end, government sources suggest there could still be ""light touch migration"" from the EU as part of a wider trade deal but they say the EU would not get ""something for nothing"" and there would have to be the same access for British citizens in Europe.They said that would not be ""preferential treatment"" because other future trade partners, for example the United States, could be offered the same kind of thing. In the Chequers agreement there is provision for a so-called ""mobility partnerships"" with the EU.It is understood that the Business Secretary Greg Clark raised the prospect of concerns from business at a sudden change, arguing that there could be pressure for a gradual, rather than an immediate, shake-up after Brexit.The Chancellor Philip Hammond agreed that was likely. But sources are adamant that the chancellor did not push for a delay and that there was a unanimous decision to move to a new system based on the principle of equal access. But the cabinet did accept that some sectors would need low-skilled migrants from the EU. If there is no deal, insiders have admitted that the new migration system won't be ready and would have to be ""tapered in"".EU citizens coming to the UK would have to apply for a work visa after they had arrived. Another cabinet source suggested however that no final decisions had been made. It's been suggested that the prime minister hopes to make an announcement about new immigration rules at the Tory conference next week. "

With the clock counting down to the UK's scheduled exit on 29 March 2019, where does this latest row leave the chances of a deal and what could happen next in the Brexit process?Mrs May has said the two sides remain ""a long way"" apart on the crucial issues of how the UK will trade with the EU after Brexit and the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.She reiterated again her belief that her Chequers blueprint was the only way of properly implementing Brexit and also ensuring a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU in the future. Please upgrade your browserThe PM has also rejected the two options put on the table by the EU - a Norway-style association agreement and a much looser relationship based on Canada's trade deal with the EU. For its part, the EU has said the Chequers plan is unworkable as it fragments the single market. The next few weeks will be crucial if these differences are to be resolved and the two sides are to fulfil their shared aim of an orderly Brexit and an outline agreement on trade, security and other issues. Mrs May has suffered plenty of Brexit setbacks in the past and soldiered but many of her own MPs don't think she is going about the process of leaving the EU the right way.The number of Tories who say they won't vote for the Chequers plan seems to be growing by the day and, remember, any deal she negotiates with the EU has to get through Parliament.There is enormous pressure from the Brexiteer-wing of the party for her to rip up Chequers and throw her weight behind an enhanced version of Canada's 2016 deal with the EU.The so-called Canada Plus Plus option, which removes most customs duties on goods but without paying for access to the single market, is backed by Boris Johnson, David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg, among others, who believe the UK Parliament will vote for it.Many Conservative Remainers, like former minister Justine Greening, have also lost faith in Chequers and think there should be a referendum (more of that later) while some Tories think the UK may well end up in a temporary European Economic Area-style arrangement, sometimes called the Norway option. This would mean accepting the free movement of people and the indirect recognition of European Court of Justice rulings - but would allow businesses access to the EU single market, with some strings attached.Amid speculation about further cabinet resignations if she persists with Chequers, calls for the PM to think again are likely to reach a crescendo at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham.If the PM does not shift on the substance of her Chequers plan, expect much frenzied talk of leadership challenges.Salzburg may have caused a dust-up but it hasn't changed the underlying reality that both sides want as amicable a divorce as possible.Some Tory MPs favour a clean break with the EU, which would see the UK fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization, the global body governing international trade, but they are in a minority.Both sides are ramping up talk of no-deal contingency planning.But they also know that such an outcome would be seen as a political failure and a disaster for business - particularly as the 21-month transition period planned after Brexit day would be scrapped.A summit on 18-19 October of EU leaders was, for a long time, pencilled in as the moment that the two sides would have to look each other in the eye and reach a deal.However, this is not now seen as feasible and the focus is on a special one-off summit that has been arranged for mid-November.An agreement then, the thinking goes, would still allow enough time for the UK and European Parliaments and a supermajority of European states - that's 20 out of 27 - to ratify any deal before the 29 March deadline.So, the clock is ticking but the EU is renowned for finalising deals at the 11th hour and it wouldn't be the first time the talks have seemed on the brink of collapse only for a deal to be pulled out of the fire. If she brings a deal back from Brussels, Theresa May has another big hurdle to negotiate. She must persuade Parliament to back it, in a vote likely before the end of the year or in early 2019.Tory Brexiteers opposed to Chequers have suggested up to 80 MPs would be prepared to vote against it. Although we don't know what the final deal will look like and the size of any rebellion would, in all likelihood, be much smaller, even a dozen Conservatives defying the leadership would risk defeat for the PM, with her non-existent Commons majority.The opposition parties are unlikely to come to the PM's aid, with Labour saying any deal is unlikely to pass its six tests guaranteeing workers' rights and all the ""benefits"" of the single market and customs union.The Labour leadership is hoping to inflict a defeat as a way of triggering a general election.It is written into law that the UK will be leaving at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019, two years to the day after the government notified the EU of its intention to quit, by triggering Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty. But if there is no deal or Parliament rejects the deal, we are in uncharted territory and it is impossible to say with any certainty what will happen next.Mrs May has insisted the 2016 referendum result will not be overturned but if Parliament cannot agree on what kind of Brexit it wants, a fresh public vote might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. But how could this happen?Should Mrs May lose a vote on her deal, she could conceivably resign and her successor may use his or her new mandate to seek Commons approval for a vote on another referendum.Alternatively, MPs who back a so-called People's Vote - which include the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, Plaid Cymru as well as a growing number of Labour MPs - could seek to table a backbench amendment to the legislation that has been promised to implement the UK's withdrawal.With most Tories, so far, publicly opposed to a referendum, any vote is likely to be extremely tight. Either way, Parliament would then need to pass enabling legislation, similar to the 2015 European Referendum Act, setting out the date of the poll, the question and the franchise, as well as other details.  As it stands, if no deal has been agreed by 21 January 2019, ministers will be required to make a statement to Parliament about the next steps. This could trigger the mother of parliamentary battles over Brexit.Some European leaders believe Brexit can be halted but unless Mrs May or her successor and the other 27 nations agree to extend the two-year Article 50 process beyond 29 March, this cannot legally happen. Critics say there won't be enough time while there is also another stumbling block in that those who back a vote do not all agree on what question should be asked on the ballot paper.While the People's Vote campaign wants the option to remain, the Labour leadership has said it should be on the terms of the deal - in other words between leaving with Mrs May's deal or no deal.What Labour really wants is a general election so it can take over the negotiations. It is only after 29 March that discussions about future co-operation - including a trade deal - will really begin in earnest. "
2018-09-26,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180926144545/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK but talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan, which was the UK's official view of a proposed Brexit deal.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May held an awayday for the cabinet at her country residence - Chequers - in July. At this gathering a favoured UK position for Brexit talks was agreed. It included proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals and says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland.

The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-26,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180926144545/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to Â£840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Parliament will vote on any withdrawal deal, if it is agreed, before the end of the year or early next year.In an article for the Telegraph titled ""a better plan for Brexit"", Mr Johnson wrote there had been a ""collective failure of government, and a collapse of will by the British establishment, to deliver on the mandate of the people"".He said the Chequers proposals - which would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in trade in goods - represented ""the intellectual error of believing we can be half-in, half-out"" of the EU.UK firms would be exposed to EU regulations that could disadvantage them, and free trade deals would be made more difficult.This, he said, was a ""democratic disaster"" and would ""cheat the electorate"" if implemented. He proposed a looser free trade agreement, ""at least as deep as the one the EU has recently concluded with Canada"".This would involve:Mr Johnson also argued that it should be ""relatively straightforward"" to negotiate membership of the EU's aviation area, with a process for recognising each other's rules and a dispute mechanism in which neither side's institutions had power over the other. On the issue of Northern Ireland, he said any ""extra procedures"" could be carried out away from the border with Ireland.But Mr Johnson said the UK would have to ""buy some time"" to negotiate such a deal, pointing at the possible need to extend any transition period beyond 2020. Mrs May set out her proposals on the key issue of future trade with the EU after a Chequers summit in July. But it has been fiercely criticised by some Brexiteers, who say her plans for a ""common rulebook"" on goods would compromise the UK's sovereignty. Up to 40 Tory Brexiteers have said they will oppose her plan if it comes to a vote in Parliament.And European leaders warned her last week that key parts of her strategy were not viable.Mrs May has dismissed previous suggestions that checks could be carried out away from the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, insisting that any system of checks was ""still a hard border"".""You don't solve the issue of no hard border by having a hard border 20km inside Ireland,"" she told the BBC last week."

We have set out the views of the Labour Party surrounding Brexit following the conference speeches made by Keir Starmer and myself.""We are obviously not negotiating. We are not in government, we are the opposition.""But he was interested to know what our views are and the six tests we have laid down by which we will hold our government in future.""Asked if Mr Barnier had offered views on Labour's Brexit plan, Mr Corbyn said: ""He made no opinion on this. It's not a negotiation, it's us informing him of what our views are and he telling us what the state of play was on the negotiations.""The Labour leader last met Mr Barnier, who is conducting the negotiations on behalf of the other 27 EU members, in July 2017.EU officials said the timing of Thursday's meeting, coming just days before the start of the Conservative Party conference, was a coincidence and stressed that it was not part of the negotiations.The meeting coincided with Mr Corbyn's trip to the Belgian capital to witness a square being renamed in honour of Jo Cox, the Labour MP who was murdered in June 2016.Speaking ahead of his meeting with Mr Barnier, Mr Corbyn said he would urge EU officials ""to do all they can to avoid a 'no-deal' outcome"": ""Crashing out of Europe with no deal risks being a national disaster."" Mrs May is under pressure to rethink her approach after European leaders warned key parts of her Chequers blueprint, which would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in trade in goods, for future relations with the EU were not viable.Up to 40 Tory Brexiteers have said they will oppose her plan if it comes to a vote in Parliament.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said talk of a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations - which Labour has said must remain an option - was ""deeply unhelpful"" to getting the best deal for Britain.But illustrating divisions within the Conservatives, his predecessor Amber Rudd told ITV's Peston that a new public vote was ""absolutely"" preferable to the UK leaving the EU next March without an agreement.And backbencher Nadine Dorries said Mrs May should step down as she had become ""handcuffed"" to the Chequers deal and was not communicating the benefits of Brexit. In his keynote leader's speech in Liverpool, Mr Corbyn said Labour would oppose a no-deal outcome and would also vote against any deal based on Chequers, as it would be extremely unlikely to meet the party's six tests, which include delivering the ""exact same benefits"" as members of the Single Market and Customs Union.But he said if the PM brought home a deal that ""includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland"", that protects jobs, people's rights at work and environmental and consumer standards, it would get his backing.Mrs May has rejected staying in any form of customs union, saying it will prevent the UK from signing trade deals with other countries and setting its own tariffs. Diplomats from the EU's 27 other members were briefed about the bloc's planning for a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday after a leaked document said the work had to intensify because of uncertainty about whether a final deal can be reached and approved by the UK and EU Parliaments."

We can change the world, thank you.""Latest news and updates from YorkshireMrs Leadbeater said the family was ""honoured that the city of Brussels has chosen to remember Jo in this way"" but voiced concerns that little political progress had been made since her death.""I think a lot of people hoped that the violent assassination of a young mother of two small children on the streets where she grew up would have a profound and long-lasting effect on the political discourse in the UK and beyond.""However, over two years after, and despite many people working extremely hard to show that Jo's murder was not in vain, I'm sadly not at all sure that this was the case.""As well as being a celebration of Jo's life, I feel that today is also an opportune time to reflect on this.""Mrs Cox was included by the city of Brussels on a list of ""illustrious women"" who will have squares, streets and buildings named after them as part of the city's plans for female and male equality."

Theresa May insisted that her close friend and ally has been doing ""an excellent job"".She also said that every effort is being made to restore devolution in Northern Ireland. In an interview on the eve of the Conservative conference for BBC Northern Ireland, Theresa May said ""what matters is the job that Karen has been doing"". ""Of course I am disappointed that we still don't have the Executive up and running and the assembly running as it should be. But every effort is being made to do this,"" said Mrs May.""Karen is also obviously taking on board the need to ensure decisions will be able to be made by the civil service in NI while there is no executive in place.""The Prime Minister's vote of confidence came as Mrs Bradley gave a speech to the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington DC calling on politicians to restore power sharing. She also stated that there is ""huge potential"" for Northern Ireland.Earlier this month, the Secretary of State told the Westminster House Magazine that she hadn't understood some of the"" deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland"", including how rare it is for unionist voters to back nationalist parties and vice versa. On Brexit, Mrs May repeated her promise to put forward new proposals on the so-called Irish backstop - an insurance policy intended to avoid a hard border - ""very shortly"". She again defended her much-criticised Chequers proposal, arguing that it offered the potential to ensure frictionless trade across the border. ""I have said to [the EU] if they have concerns with this issue of the border arrangements and the free trade area let's hear in details what those concerns are and if they have counter proposals let's hear those counter proposals,"" said Mrs May. After BBC Northern Ireland revealed that government officials are warning about the possibility of power cuts should Brexit disrupt the Single Electricity market within Ireland, Mrs May said she recognised the importance of the electricity sector. The Prime Minister argued that this sentiment is shared widely in Ireland and across the EU and work is under way to ensure the present arrangements for electricity supply are able to continue after the UK leaves the EU. Questioned about whether the Conservatives' parliamentary pact with the DUP has constrained their room for manoeuvre in the Brexit talks, Mrs May insisted that she is trying to deliver ""a proposal that works for the whole of the UK""."

During his visit to the UK in July, Mr Trump backtracked on claims he was said to have made in a newspaper interview that Mrs May's Brexit strategy made doing a trade deal harder - reports he described as fake news.Mr Trump has questioned the role of institutions like the UN, saying the ""ideology of globalism"" had run its course, and the US under his leadership was pursuing a ""doctrine of patriotism"". But in her speech to the UN, Mrs May sought to reassure those who fear the UK's departure from the EU next March will see the country turning in on itself and disengaging from pressing international problems. Citing the UK's continued membership of the G7, G20 and Nato among other collective bodies, she said there was ""no single model for balancing the democratic demands of our public with the imperative to co-operate internationally"".""The vote by the people to leave the EU was not a rejection of multilateralism or international co-operation.""It was a clear demand for decisions and accountability to lie closer to home. I believe the role of leadership in these circumstances is clear - it is delivering on the democratic wishes of our people and international co-operation, working with allies and partners in pursuit of our shared values.""The prime minister reiterated her continued support for an international deal on Iran's nuclear programme - which the US is pulling out of - and said other threats to the international order, like nuclear proliferation and state-sponsored terrorism, could only be addressed by countries working together. Earlier, Mrs May's approach to Brexit was questioned at a meeting of global business leaders in New York.The chief executive of the leading investment company, Blackstone, told her that from a risk management perspective, the future was ""daunting"".At a global business forum organised by Bloomberg, Steve Schwarzman asked the prime minister ""how bad things could get"" in the event of an unacceptable deal or the talks breaking down altogether.Mrs May repeated her confidence that a deal could be reached, but she acknowledged there was uncertainty.   She said there were still several weeks of intense negotiation to be done with the EU and argued that Brexit brought a ""sharper focus"" to existing efforts to prepare the UK economy for the future. But the BBC's political correspondent Ben Wright said her encounter with the big beasts of Wall Street did not always look comfortable and revealed again the concern many large companies have about Brexit."

It means people will not have to ask for the information when they apply or go for a job interview.The change has been driven by MP Jo Swinson, who wants all big firms to be transparent on leave policies.She is calling for all companies employing more than 250 people to have to make this information easily available.Matt Turner has two young sons. Knowing that Santander would give him four weeks full paternity pay made him stay with the business. He thinks that it's important to be up-front about these policies.""Jobs are not seen as just a source of income,"" he said. ""People are interested in what benefits are available, too."" Matt said it's not easy to feel confident to ask about parental leave when applying for a job or in an interview - and that information needs to be available to would-be mums and dads. Santander is one of ten UK firms to have signed up to publish policies on pay and leave.Jessica Chu, who heads up inclusion at the bank, wants to see other firms do the same: ""It really lets potential employees choose who they want to work with and see the benefits that are on offer for them."" Accountancy firm PwC has signed up too - and said the move marked another step towards levelling the playing field when it comes to recruitment and progression.""We're working hard to create a culture where parents feel supported and different ways of working are celebrated,"" said Laura Hinton, PwC chief people officer, adding that the firm want dads to feel as comfortable as mums when it comes to requesting information.Ms Swinson, who is deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, thinks there's no excuse for firms not putting this information online.  ""Companies all have to have a parental pay and leave policy, even if it's as simple as statutory, but there are many offering more,"" she said. ""It's an opportunity for businesses to sell themselves."" Ms Swinson is motivated by data that shows over 50,000 women have lost their job when they start a family. ""I think this would lead to more questions being asked in board rooms and in local cafes about who has the better policy and that itself will drive progress."" She believes this information should be published alongside gender pay gap data each year.The idea gets the thumbs up from Helen Bryce, who runs recruitment business Guilty Mothers Club, that supports working parents. She said that parents have told her about companies that view children as an ""inconvenience."" ""You would always have in the back of your mind that this was the reason you did not get a job,"" she said. ""Would I ask about this in an interview? Absolutely not.""Helen said this caused women's careers to stagnate: ""It's easier to get back into the same job and work flexibly than it is to seek out new opportunities"" Workplace discrimination when pregnant is covered by the Equalities Act (2010) but it is tricky to prove discrimination when applying for jobs and considering starting a family.  A recent Equalities and Human Rights Commission survey found it was common for companies to ask about family plans and that this kind of discrimination has increased 'significantly' over the last decade or so.Business group the CBI welcomed firms taking proactive steps. ""Companies that place inclusion at the heart of their business are more engaged, competitive and productive,"" said Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director.""Voluntary action of this kind can only be positive and we'd encourage firms to make this information publically available.""Ten companies to publish parental leave policies:Source: Liberal Democrats"
2018-09-27,Northern Ireland power blackouts warning,https://web.archive.org//web/20180928014846/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45657966,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA no-deal Brexit could result in electricity blackouts across Northern Ireland, government officials have warned. Officials are preparing a 'no deal' notice about the impacts on the all-island Single Electricity Market (SEM).They have suggested there are risks of price increases and supply shortages.Most experts have considered the SEM to be a relatively unproblematic part of Brexit.The reason is that it is a UK-Ireland bilateral arrangement, rather than an EU arrangement.It has been in place since 2007 and allows for a single market to operate across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.However, it is underpinned by the UK and Ireland's membership of the Internal Energy Market (IEM).All EU members participate in the IEM along with Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein.Participation requires alignment with EU rules including industrial emissions regulations and restrictions on state aid.The work carried out by UK officials says the surest way to maintain the SEM is for continued UK participation in the IEM.They suggest that in a no-deal Brexit, the SEM would, at best, continue but be at risk.They raise an alternative possibility that it could split ""leaving an insecure, isolated NI market"".That in turn could see bills in Northern Ireland rise by up to 34%, lead to blackouts and prompt government intervention.Keeping the SEM operating ""in any way possible"" is described as a priority.The officials suggest that even if there is no withdrawal deal, the government could seek a special deal with Ireland and the EU to keep the SEM operating.But they cautioned that such an arrangement would not fully mitigate legal risks to the SEM.It is understood that a formal ""no deal notice"" on the SEM will be published in the next few weeks. A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the EU said the government does not comment on leaks.The blackout warning was met with scepticism by DUP MP Ian Paisley, a Brexit supporter, who dismissed it on Twitter as ""fake news"".Mr Paisely tweeted: ""Don't forget planes falling out of the sky, food shortage, mass unemployment and pestilence!""The DUP have been supporting the Conservative Party in a confidence and supply agreement since summer 2017."

But this loss would be much much bigger if we didn't have in the end an agreement. Therefore I think it is worth fighting for such an agreement and to negotiate very hard.""In the end I have a certain optimism that a common solution will be found.""Reform of farm subsidies within the EU was also needed, he argued - especially in light of the loss of the UK's share of funding for the Common Agricultural Policy.Direct payments to farmers are likely to be cut, with the European Union moving in a similar direction to the approach being advocated in the UK of rewarding farmers for delivering public goods, such as environmental projects.  He also said that Welsh farmers face ""big difficulties"" outside the EU unless the public do more to support them.Trade barriers in the event of a no-deal could hurt the Welsh lamb sector in particular, Mr Fischler predicted, with European buyers turning elsewhere.Currently farmers are heavily reliant on exporting their goods to EU markets, including nearly a third of Welsh lamb, while 13% of Welsh beef is exported outside the UK. Better marketing and investment would be required to promote the products within Wales and the UK, Mr Fischler claimed.Consumers would need to show ""a certain patriotism"" for local food.Whatever the outcome of negotiations, he claimed Welsh farmers were unlikely to be better off, predicting that the budget for farm subsidy payments ""will not be the same as it is now"".""The question is will the British government be ready to replace the funds [to support farming] which are now covered by the EU with national funds?""Mr Fischler spent six years as Austria's farming minister and is now President of the European Forum Alpbach, a non-profit organisation that hosts an annual ideas festival. He said Wales could learn a lot from his country's approach.""Like Wales, Austria is also a disadvantaged area for agriculture, we have many mountain farmers, many small size farms - but they make a living out of their activities only because they are marketing and selling locally.""When asked to comment on Mr Fischler's views, the European commission referred to Michel Barnier's first speech on the negotiations, which he said would have ""important consequences for our economies and for our people on both sides of the channel"".On Thursday the Welsh Government will announce Â£3.2m in EU funding for five projects to prepare the food, farming and fisheries industries for Brexit, including with branding.Rural Affairs secretary Lesley Griffiths said: ""A 'no deal' departure from the EU would have a catastrophic impact on our economy and jobs. The publication of the latest set of technical notes only further highlights the possibility of a world of new burdens, red tape, disruption and uncertainty. ""That is why it is so crucial that our industries put themselves in the best position and prepare for a post-Brexit world."" Gwyn Howells, chief executive of Meat Promotion Wales, said it was ""absolutely true"" that more would need to be done to increase sales of Welsh food and drink locally in the event of a no-deal, and warned it was imperative that politicians ""thrash out a deal"".But rural affairs spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives Andrew RT Davies said Brexit offered ""a great opportunity to tailor-make a solution for Welsh agriculture"".""What we want is a deal that suits both parties and encourages trade across borders."""

The paper clarified that this meant electricity and heating, so not transport.The first thing to say is that the plan to achieve this by 2030 assumes that there will be a Labour government in place early next year.Capacity from solar power would be increased to 35,000MW, onshore wind to 30,000MW and offshore wind to 52,000MW. You can see from the chart above that those would be big increases, but Labour has given itself 12 years to achieve them.Let's start with solar power. The plan is a bit confusing because it says that the UK's solar capacity would be almost tripled to 35,000MW by 2030 ""with a combination of large and small-scale installations, installing solar PV [panels] on all viable UK roofs"".A viable roof is effectively any one that is structurally sound so that it can support the panels and facing any direction other than north, according to the industry.The Solar Trade Association told BBC Reality Check that the 35,000MW capacity from rooftop solar panels by 2030 could be achieved relatively easily, but that it would not require all viable roofs to have panels.You can see from the chart above that the rate at which new generating capacity was being installed, slowed after the government cut subsidies to households installing solar panels at the end of 2015. But the industry says that a big resource available to be exploited is the roofs of commercial and industrial properties.The plan for onshore wind involves having 6,000 more turbines by 2030. There are currently 7,638 onshore turbines either operational or under construction, so the number would be almost doubled.Offshore wind plans would involve adding 7,500 turbines to the existing 2,296 either operational or under construction, so that would more than quadruple the number of offshore turbines.The party plans to meet the demand for all the necessary ""turbine components, high voltage cables and the large supply chain of goods required, from lifting gear to electric control equipment"" through UK manufacturing.The industry body Renewable UK says that currently 48% of spending on planning, building and running UK offshore wind projects goes to firms in the UK.Examples include MHI Vestas Offshore Wind, which makes 80m-long blades on the Isle of Wight, Siemens Gamesa manufacturing blades and assembling offshore turbines in Hull and JDR Cables in Hartlepool, which supplies subsea cabling for offshore wind farms.BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh points out: ""It is unclear whether engineering companies are able to make parts for and construct turbines at the rate Mr Corbyn has promised."" The plans to make homes cheaper to heat and more energy efficient are the only part to which money has been allocated so far. Labour has set aside Â£12.8bn in its National Transformation Fund to cover the insulation programme in its first term, which will pay for the work to be done free for the homes of lower income owner-occupiers and those in social housing as well as zero interest loans to help those who are able to pay for the work.But as Pallab Ghosh points out: ""Successive governments have failed to persuade enough people to insulate their homes, even if it is for free.""What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-09-27,Laura Kuenssberg,https://web.archive.org//web/20180928014846/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45661781,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA few days before this Labour conference, one of Jeremy Corbyn's close allies suggested to me this would be the week that would demonstrate if Mr Corbyn has really transformed the Labour Party.Whether he meant the promises he made to his supporters when vowing to bring in a genuinely ""new kind of politics"".Well, Jeremy Corbyn has changed. His son Ben told us today, after his father's speech, that he was ""smoother"" now, and, excitedly, he claimed: ""There was a new centre emerging."" And yes, Labour has changed. Looking out on to the crowds chanting his name, their leader could be sure that hall, that audience, is behind him. After three years of angst, with some MPs trying to remove him, Mr Corbyn - or his team - have almost total control over his party and its mechanisms. MPs who were part of his early core of loyalists are understandably emboldened. MPs who despair of the leadership are mainly subdued, resigned to ""waiting it out"", as one described it.After the general election last year - and given the profound uncertainty in our politics right now - dissenters are unsure if their warnings that he could never win power were totally, and utterly, wrong. The bitterness between the two sides is still there, but the urgency has disappeared. As one insider described it, ""when you fight all the time, it's just exhausting"". To an extent, those Labour people who battled Corbyn and his enthusiastic supporters are simply too tired of it right now to carry on. But hold on a minute - not everything has gone according to the script. The rule changes that would make it easier for activists to change MPs, easier for members to have a say over policy, easier for members to influence the party's direction, did not sweep through without obstacle. And in setting policy through the National Policy Forum - a formal process - or trying to influence Labour in local government, or changing the selection rules, the changes that were meant to add up to a wholesale transformation of the party have not gone as far as originally intended. That's partly because when you scratch beneath the surface, there's a profound debate happening in all parts of the Labour Party about what comes next. Sure, in the immediate future, they are hopeful that a general election could emerge out of some chaotic post-Brexit vote, that could see them ride into power. But whatever the short term brings, with all its unpredictable scenarios, there is also a conversation about the long term. Some senior figures genuinely believe that the changes that have been wrought so far are just the beginning. The future for Labour, they argue, is in a mass movement where members have the control. In the optimistic version of this, Labour could build an entirely new model for British politics, with Jeremy Corbyn as the symbol for that new style, where members of the public who choose to join the party have their say. The darker scenario that could emerge, some MPs fear, is that rather than spending their time challenging their opponents in Westminster, scrutinising policy and representing all their constituents, they are consumed by a semi-permanent campaign to keep local activists happy - in order to keep their jobs. It's easier to argue for greater accountability and greater democracy, but those cautious about the idea argue it's just plain naÃ¯ve to imagine that those changes would not have a profound and negative impact on the job MPs do in Parliament. And there are frustrations on both sides. Plenty of people, whether in the Parliamentary party or in the unions, or in Momentum, or local party level, are finding individual frustrations. It's worth noting that the unions have been a big part of the block on some of the more sweeping changes that Jeremy Corbyn's supporters wanted.Yes, he has had crucial backing from those big voices in order to keep his job in the last few years - particularly vital still is the voice of Len McCluskey - but the unions have, no doubt, applied the brakes on some of the things that could have happened. Precisely in the same way they tried to do in previous times. As one shadow cabinet minister said: ""The right of the party never managed to completely subdue the unions, the left won't do it either."" They still pay the bills. The bitter fights about changes to this rule or that rule - and union resistance to them - are not about what happens to Jeremy Corbyn, but about what comes next. One senior figure told me: ""I'd rather gamble on the future leadership of the unions than on a huge bunch of activists."" Labour has changed, and changed dramatically, but some things stay the same. There is ""a shudder in the air"" - not about Mr Corbyn's leadership, Labour has made an uneasy peace with that - but about what remains when his days as leader are over. In volatile political times, of course, events, rather than Labour's own dilemmas, are likely to shape what happens. But beyond Liverpool this week, beyond the fringe, beyond the hall, there is a question being asked in Labour circles: is Jeremy Corbyn's leadership the start, or the end?"
2018-09-27,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180928014846/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45640548,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowShadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed the Labour Party is preparing to vote against whatever deal Theresa May brings back from negotiations with the European Union. What is Labour's Brexit policy, and what does it think should happen next?First of all, Labour says the government's Brexit proposals are failing to meet the six tests that Labour set out last year.Labour says these are the tests against which it will judge any final Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May's government, as part of the Article 50 negotiations on leaving the EU. They are: Labour has now published a report, which says all six of the tests are ""on course to be failed"".""Let me be very clear - right here, right now,"" Sir Keir told the BBC. ""If Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts.""But there are buts. When you look at the tests it is hardly surprising that they are on course to be failed, because of the way Labour set them out in the first place, as a way to judge the final Brexit deal. What is being negotiated between the UK and the EU now is the withdrawal agreement - the terms of divorce, rather than the precise detail of the future relationship. So it's not the final deal, and that makes some of the tests rather hard to assess fully at this stage. Take test number one: does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the EU? No-one can ensure that at the moment, and we probably won't know for sure until long after we've left. If a deal on a withdrawal agreement is done, it will be accompanied by a non-binding political declaration, which will presumably gush enthusiastically about a strong partnership in the future. Please upgrade your browserBoth sides want a strong partnership; they will remain neighbours. But the details will have to be negotiated later. A political declaration would set the tone and give some detail, but it could still lead to a blind Brexit: in other words, leaving without knowing our final destination.Take test number two: does a deal give the UK the ""exact same benefits"" as membership of the single market and the customs union? Well there's only really one way to achieve the ""exact same benefits"" and that's staying in the single market and the customs union, which is not official Labour policy. Labour says it wants to stay in ""a"" customs union, and stay as close to the single market as possible. That is not the same as membership, so you can argue that even current Labour policy would fail its own test. Labour is keen to emphasise that the six tests are based on promises and commitments the government made about what it would achieve in Brexit negotiations. So this process was certainly a way of holding the government to account. But the tests were also broad enough to cope with divisions within the Labour party about the best way forward. Now, though, the six tests have led to a decisive moment - barring unexpected developments, Labour will vote against a Brexit deal, increasing the chances that it will get rejected. Sir Keir says that's because the government has ""no credible plan"" for Brexit. But does the Labour party have one?Sir Keir confirmed that Labour wanted a general election if the government was defeated in a ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit, although Jeremy Corbyn later said he would also try to send the government back to Brussels to negotiate again.In other words, very little in Labour's Brexit strategy appears to be set in stone. The trouble with the idea of calling for another election is that it's not in Labour's gift. If Prime Minister Theresa May decided to call for an election, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act two-thirds of MPs would have to vote in favour (or go through a no-confidence procedure). And even if a snap election were to take place, it's not clear what would be in a Labour manifesto. Would it include explicit support for another referendum? Would it openly support staying in the single market, even on an interim basis?What we do know is that under the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act, the government would have 21 days to tell Parliament what it intended to do next if MPs rejected a Brexit deal in a ""meaningful vote"". Debates would have to take place in the House of Commons and the House of Lords within seven days. But what would be debated?These are obviously uncharted waters, and it may be up to the Speaker to decide whether any motions to be considered in parliament at that time could be amended, to allow, for example, for MPs to call for another referendum.The government's thinking on the Speaker's role is set out in this Written Ministerial Statement.Pushing for another referendum may well become Labour's main strategy, if it is unable to force an election. In his speech to conference, Sir Keir said the party had to be able to put forward alternatives to leaving the EU with no deal, including - crucially - campaigning for a public vote.   When the shadow Brexit secretary emphasised that nobody was ruling out Remain as an option in such a vote (a remark that was not in the text of the speech distributed to journalists) he received a standing ovation. But not everyone in the party was cheering.Groups like Labour Leave hold a very different view, arguing that ""throwing around the possibility of a second referendum is devastating to the party's brand"". And even within the shadow cabinet there are differences of opinion about the best Brexit strategy to pursue. Leaving the European Union involves big decisions about the way the country is run, bigger than this generation of politicians has faced before. So it is not surprising that the arguments within both Labour and the Conservatives go well beyond traditional party loyalties. But time is running very short for those decisions to be made.

2018-09-27,Brexit: What happens next?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180928014846/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45601502,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has warned that the Brexit negotiations are at an impasse and there will be no progress until the EU treats her proposals seriously.She has accused EU leaders of showing the UK a lack of respect after they rebuffed her Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit without, she said, any alternative or explanation. With the clock counting down to the UK's scheduled exit on 29 March 2019, where does this latest row leave the chances of a deal and what could happen next in the Brexit process?Mrs May has said the two sides remain ""a long way"" apart on the crucial issues of how the UK will trade with the EU after Brexit and the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.She reiterated again her belief that her Chequers blueprint was the only way of properly implementing Brexit and also ensuring a ""deep and special partnership"" with the EU in the future. Please upgrade your browserThe PM has also rejected the two options put on the table by the EU - a Norway-style association agreement and a much looser relationship based on Canada's trade deal with the EU. For its part, the EU has said the Chequers plan is unworkable as it fragments the single market. The next few weeks will be crucial if these differences are to be resolved and the two sides are to fulfil their shared aim of an orderly Brexit and an outline agreement on trade, security and other issues. Mrs May has suffered plenty of Brexit setbacks in the past and soldiered but many of her own MPs don't think she is going about the process of leaving the EU the right way.The number of Tories who say they won't vote for the Chequers plan seems to be growing by the day and, remember, any deal she negotiates with the EU has to get through Parliament.There is enormous pressure from the Brexiteer-wing of the party for her to rip up Chequers and throw her weight behind an enhanced version of Canada's 2016 deal with the EU.The so-called Canada Plus Plus option, which removes most customs duties on goods but without paying for access to the single market, is backed by Boris Johnson, David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg, among others, who believe the UK Parliament will vote for it.Many Conservative Remainers, like former minister Justine Greening, have also lost faith in Chequers and think there should be a referendum (more of that later) while some Tories think the UK may well end up in a temporary European Economic Area-style arrangement, sometimes called the Norway option. This would mean accepting the free movement of people and the indirect recognition of European Court of Justice rulings - but would allow businesses access to the EU single market, with some strings attached.Amid speculation about further cabinet resignations if she persists with Chequers, calls for the PM to think again are likely to reach a crescendo at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham.If the PM does not shift on the substance of her Chequers plan, expect much frenzied talk of leadership challenges.Salzburg may have caused a dust-up but it hasn't changed the underlying reality that both sides want as amicable a divorce as possible.Some Tory MPs favour a clean break with the EU, which would see the UK fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization, the global body governing international trade, but they are in a minority.Both sides are ramping up talk of no-deal contingency planning.But they also know that such an outcome would be seen as a political failure and a disaster for business - particularly as the 21-month transition period planned after Brexit day would be scrapped.A summit on 18-19 October of EU leaders was, for a long time, pencilled in as the moment that the two sides would have to look each other in the eye and reach a deal.However, this is not now seen as feasible and the focus is on a special one-off summit that has been arranged for mid-November.An agreement then, the thinking goes, would still allow enough time for the UK and European Parliaments and a supermajority of European states - that's 20 out of 27 - to ratify any deal before the 29 March deadline.So, the clock is ticking but the EU is renowned for finalising deals at the 11th hour and it wouldn't be the first time the talks have seemed on the brink of collapse only for a deal to be pulled out of the fire. If she brings a deal back from Brussels, Theresa May has another big hurdle to negotiate. She must persuade Parliament to back it, in a vote likely before the end of the year or in early 2019.Tory Brexiteers opposed to Chequers have suggested up to 80 MPs would be prepared to vote against it. Although we don't know what the final deal will look like and the size of any rebellion would, in all likelihood, be much smaller, even a dozen Conservatives defying the leadership would risk defeat for the PM, with her non-existent Commons majority.The opposition parties are unlikely to come to the PM's aid, with Labour saying any deal is unlikely to pass its six tests guaranteeing workers' rights and all the ""benefits"" of the single market and customs union.The Labour leadership is hoping to inflict a defeat as a way of triggering a general election.It is written into law that the UK will be leaving at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019, two years to the day after the government notified the EU of its intention to quit, by triggering Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty. But if there is no deal or Parliament rejects the deal, we are in uncharted territory and it is impossible to say with any certainty what will happen next.Mrs May has insisted the 2016 referendum result will not be overturned but if Parliament cannot agree on what kind of Brexit it wants, a fresh public vote might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. But how could this happen?Should Mrs May lose a vote on her deal, she could conceivably resign and her successor may use his or her new mandate to seek Commons approval for a vote on another referendum.Alternatively, MPs who back a so-called People's Vote - which include the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, Plaid Cymru as well as a growing number of Labour MPs - could seek to table a backbench amendment to the legislation that has been promised to implement the UK's withdrawal.With most Tories, so far, publicly opposed to a referendum, any vote is likely to be extremely tight. Either way, Parliament would then need to pass enabling legislation, similar to the 2015 European Referendum Act, setting out the date of the poll, the question and the franchise, as well as other details.  As it stands, if no deal has been agreed by 21 January 2019, ministers will be required to make a statement to Parliament about the next steps. This could trigger the mother of parliamentary battles over Brexit.Some European leaders believe Brexit can be halted but unless Mrs May or her successor and the other 27 nations agree to extend the two-year Article 50 process beyond 29 March, this cannot legally happen. Critics say there won't be enough time while there is also another stumbling block in that those who back a vote do not all agree on what question should be asked on the ballot paper.While the People's Vote campaign wants the option to remain, the Labour leadership has said it should be on the terms of the deal - in other words between leaving with Mrs May's deal or no deal.What Labour really wants is a general election so it can take over the negotiations. It is only after 29 March that discussions about future co-operation - including a trade deal - will really begin in earnest. "

2018-09-27,Warehouse edition,https://web.archive.org//web/20180928014846/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45627152,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWhere will all the stuff go?Because it is hard to see how Brexit doesn't (at some point) involve British businesses wanting or needing to keep more stuff closer to home. By stuff, I mean parts, raw materials or inventories of finished products. There is a short term and, to a lesser extent, a longer term question here. Given uncertainty about what happens next March when we leave the EU, many businesses may want to have extra supplies on hand in case a disorderly exit leads to disruption at our borders. One estimate put this stockpiling of imports at about Â£40 billion.But longer-term, more bureaucracy, paperwork, checks or delays on imports could also induce companies to keep more (and potentially manufacture more) in the UK.  This would be a much smaller figure - but could vary depending on what exactly the new arrangements are and how confident companies feel that they will to work. And the trouble is, the UK doesn't have much space - specifically warehousing space. We are, according to property company Savills, an ""under-warehoused country"". Our warehousing stock works out to about 7.6 square foot of space per head compared to the US at 39 square foot per head. It is also a market that has been squeezed both on the supply and the demand side. Speculative development - or building a warehouse without a tenant already signed up to take it - fell sharply after the financial crisis started in 2007. Readily-available funding to speculatively build large warehouses and logistics facilities has never really recovered.Meanwhile, the rapacious growth of e-commerce has gobbled up space in recent years. Amazon dominated the market in terms of demand between about 2014 and 2016, according to one expert, and retailing still accounts for about two-thirds of take-up of space. The result is this: a sharp fall in the vacancy rate for warehouses of over 100,000 square feet. The national vacancy rate is about 6%, and is as low as 3% in some areas of London and the South East.  One industry rule of thumb holds that a vacancy rate of under 10% is a catalyst for rising rents.(So this is one example of a sector that is probably benefitting from uncertainty around Brexit. Indeed, there are signs that speculative development is starting to pick up as some scent an opportunity.)Still, some car manufacturers have told Newsnight that there isn't enough warehousing space near their factories to be fully ready for a no-deal Brexit. And perhaps that isn't surprising, given the scale involved. Honda has estimated that holding the required nine days of supply would require a warehouse the size of 42 football pitches, according to the FT. Other sectors may also find themselves tight. Specialist types of space - like cold storage for frozen foods - tend to be in shorter supply. NewCold, a company focused on frozen supply chain logistics, says it has started to receive Brexit-related demands for space, including from food companies wanting to increase stocks of food in the first half of next year. It has left a 'Brexit buffer' in its recently-expanded Wakefield facility and is planning to build another site further south once an anchor tenant is secured. Greater trade friction, delays at ports and airports, a rethink of international supply chains. Many of the potential knock-on effects from Brexit have something in common: they require space. And the UK may find itself wanting more of it in a hurry. "

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK but talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan, which was the UK's official view of a proposed Brexit deal.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May held an awayday for the cabinet at her country residence - Chequers - in July. At this gathering a favoured UK position for Brexit talks was agreed. It included proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals and says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanFollowing the European Council President Donald Tusk's rejection of the Chequers plan after the EU's September gathering, there has been mounting speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. One of Mrs May's repeated phrases has been that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". A wide-range of documents setting out the probable state of play if the UK leaves the EU without a deal has been recently published by the government. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but a group of Tory MPs have endorsed a plan for a ""clean break"" with the EU.Reality Check: The case for a 'clean-break' BrexitBrexit papers: What no deal could meanPet travel warning in no-deal Brexit planBritain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-09-27,Labour Party conference,https://web.archive.org//web/20180928014846/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45646690,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour is ""ready"" to start work on a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"", Jeremy Corbyn has told his party conference in Liverpool.The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture that has dominated politics and ""kickstart a green jobs revolution"".""We represent the new common sense of our time,"" he told the Labour faithful.Mr Corbyn also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.But he said that Labour would oppose the PM's current plan ""or whatever is left of it"", and vowed to fight any move to leave the EU without a deal.Labour is hoping to force a general election if the final Brexit settlement is rejected by Parliament, and has not ruled out backing another referendum if one is not called.Mr Corbyn spoke for more than an hour, setting out his vision for a ""fairer society under Labour"" to enthusiastic support in the hall. ""When we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government. Investing in Britain after years of austerity and neglect and bringing our country together after a decade of division,"" he told delegates, to cheers.He told them ""the old way of running things isn't working anymore"" and Labour's better-than-expected election result last year showed voters were ready for something new.""Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.""But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.""People in this country know - they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn't working any more."" AnalysisThe Labour conference is more at ease with itself this year, and this speech was designed to show the rest of the country that that party has solid, credible, worked-out answers for the questions of the day.Scepticism about his programme still runs far and wide in the parliamentary party at Westminster.But this Liverpool gathering has more or less, despite tensions over the EU, shown that Labour has moved on from the turmoil when Mr Corbyn first took over.Party conferences are always a shop window for leaders to show their wares to the rest of the country.Read more from LauraLabour members voted on Tuesday to keep all options on the table - including a fresh referendum - if there is no Brexit deal with Brussels.Mr Corbyn said in his speech he would support Theresa May on Brexit - if she got a ""sensible"" deal that included a customs union that prevented the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland and protected workers' rights.He said Labour would vote against the PM's Chequers plan ""or whatever is left of it"" and oppose leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would be a ""national disaster"".But he told Mrs May: ""If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people's rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. ""A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.""But if you can't negotiate that deal then you need to make way for a party that can and will.""This call, delivered with venom by Mr Corbyn, went down well in the hall. Delegates gave their leader a standing ovation and there was an outbreak of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"".Mrs May has consistently ruled out a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader also used his speech to announce plans to create 400,000 skilled jobs with new investment in fresh wind farms and insulation for homes.He pointed to Labour's commitment to reduce the UK's net carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 - and to zero by 2050.Labour's energy plans would ""make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations"", said Mr Corbyn.And they would bring ""skills and security to communities held back for too long"", in all parts of the UK.Turning to the row over anti-Semitism in Labour, Mr Corbyn said it had caused ""immense hurt and anxiety"" and there was a standing ovation as he told Jewish people: ""We are your ally.""Being anti-racist was ""integral to our very being"", he went on, adding that he would not accept being accused of anti-Semitism by ""Tory hypocrites"", criticising the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and MEPs' ""support"" for the Hungarian government of Viktor Orban.On foreign policy, Mr Corbyn said evidence ""now points clearly to the Russian state"" as being responsible for the Salisbury poisoning and promised ""no more reckless wars of intervention"" like those in Iraq and Libya.And he condemned the actions of Israeli forces in Gaza, calling for a ""secure Israel and a viable and secure Palestinian state"".Labour would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it takes office, he said, ""in order to help make that two-state settlement a reality"".Earlier in his speech, to applause in the arena, he attacked parts of the British press, saying billionaire newspapers owners did not like Labour ""one little bit"".He called on supporters to challenge their ""propaganda of privilege"", using ""the mass media of the 21st century"" - social media.Freedom of the press must be protected, he said: ""But here, a free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful.""Mr Corbyn said Labour would put ""fairness and humanity"" back into public services, pointing to pledges to increase the number of police officers and expand free childcare.Labour has used its week in Liverpool to announce a string of new policies, building on those contained in its 2017 general election manifesto.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell unveiled plans to force large companies to give staff 1% of their shares a year, netting them up to Â£500 a year each.He also set out plans to ""democratise"" the economy by renationalising the water industry, which he said would hand power to workers, consumers and local councils. Further nationalisations - of the rail, mail and energy industries - would follow under a Labour government.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the speech showed Mr Corbyn ""was unfit to govern"" and would ""open the door to re-running the referendum"".The SNP said the Scottish government was already delivering on issues mentioned in the speech such as tough climate change targets, a publicly-owned bid to run Scotland's railways and free sanitary products in schools.And Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn must listen to his party members and support the campaign to stop Brexit. The CBI business group's director general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was ""much common ground between business and Labour"" but warned that ""continual public barbs and backward-facing policy are deterring entrepreneurs and investors, at a time when we need them most"".Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""That speech was inspiring. We heard a Labour leader draw a very clear line under the failed policies of the past, policies that have caused despair and division in our communities, and then set out a distinctive, different, positive Labour programme for the country.""The British Chambers of Commerce said there were some ""bright spots"" but ""Jeremy Corbyn missed a golden opportunity to extend an olive branch to British business""."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

A government source said Mr Johnson was ""regurgitating ideas"", not coming up with any new answers.Mr Johnson quit the cabinet in July in protest at Mrs May's plan for future economic co-operation with the EU, which he says will curb the UK's sovereignty and betray the 2016 referendum vote. His latest attack on Mrs May's policy, which would see the UK sign up to a common rule book for trade in goods, comes two days before the start of the Conservative Party conference.In an article for the Daily Telegraph on Friday, Mr Johnson claimed the Chequers plan was ""a moral and intellectual humiliation"" for the UK and it was not too late for Mrs May to back a ""super Canada"" deal, which is favoured by many Tory Brexiteers. Speaking to the BBC's political editor, in his first interview since quitting the cabinet, he rejected suggestions he was simply trying to make life difficult for the prime minister, describing Theresa May as a ""remarkable person"". ""As she said to us herself and she said to the country...she will go for as long as she feels it necessary.""He urged Mrs May to ""get back"" to the principles he said she had initially set out in Brexit negotiations before, in his words, being ""blown off course"" by the 2017 general election. Asked to rule out a leadership challenge if this did not happen, he replied: ""My job is to speak up for what I believe in and the vision that I've set out today and I believe in it very very sincerely.""I'm going to keep going for as long as it takes.""He added: ""The most important thing for me is to avert what I think would be a political and economic disaster for this country. To come out of the EU but still to be run by the EU - what is the point of that?"" By BBC Political Editor Laura KuenssbergIt is no secret that he still wants and believes he has a shot at Number 10.And having turned down interviews for several months after his departure from government, speaking out today on the eve of the Conservative conference outwardly appears designed to stir as much trouble as possible.Mr Johnson is adamant, of course, that what he is really involved in is trying to change Number 10's policy, rather than trying to shove Theresa May out.Read Laura's blogThe Chequers plan was ""unacceptable"" to the British public, he said, and it was ""pie in the sky"" to suggest, as some have done, that it could be modified after the UK's exit from the EU on 29 March, 2019. ""It will do lasting damage to the credibility of this country around the world. People will say the UK is a greater power, a great economy. Why are they so passive and so supine as to remain in the orbit of Brussels.""Asked whether he was prepared to actually vote down a deal based on Chequers if it came to it in Parliament, and potentially see the UK leaving without a deal, he said: ""You will have to see.""But he added: ""At the moment, I cannot see how I can support Chequers, I have to be honest.""In response, a government source said: ""Boris was a member of the Cabinet that agreed the December Joint Report and praised the PM for doing so.""The truth is that reneging on those things would simply guarantee no deal.""And Tory MP Sir Alan Duncan - a junior minister in Mr Johnson's old department - said his former boss was addicted to media attention.""Publicity is his cocaine. He needs a regular fix,"" the foreign office minister told The Spectator. But, he added, Mr Johnson's power as an ""electoral asset"" was ""now waning"".The UK and EU are seeking to negotiate the terms of exit, as well as an outline agreement on future cooperation by the middle of November at the latest. But the European Parliament's representative in Brexit talks warned the UK it will not approve a relationship with the UK where EU nationals were discriminated against by nationality or type of job.Referring to the cabinet's recent decision that EU nationals would not be privileged in the UK's new immigration regime, Guy Verhoftsadt said the system for EU citizens coming to the UK after Brexit would likely be reciprocated for British citizens moving in the other direction. Meanwhile, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has ruled out standing as a candidate to become the next head of the European Commission, saying he was committed to seeing the talks through ""right to the end"".

He told me today that couldn't be further from the truth. But he will know the task ahead will be a tough one. Like his fellow Conservative contenders, he is in favour of Brexit and hopes to lead a city that was the only region in England to vote to remain. Labour has also done well in London in recent years and has more councils, councillors and MPs than the Conservatives. It also has a much larger membership in the capital, foot soldiers who can cover the hard yards needed in a campaign. Bailey was picked in a contest in which just over 7,000 Conservatives voted - about half of their London membership. Much will be expected of them as they, and Londoners, get to know their new candidate.  Mr Bailey said: ""It is a great honour to be selected as the Conservative Party's candidate for the 2020 London mayoral election. ""For someone who grew up in a council house in one of the poorest parts of London, securing this nomination is proof that our city truly is the place where anything is possible.""London has given me so much. ""It's why I've spent my entire adult life trying to repay its generosity, either through my twenty plus years of youth work helping to steer children away from a life of crime and towards work opportunities, or my current involvement on the London Assembly, where I have done my best to hold the current mayor to account.""He has vowed to cut City Hall bureaucracy to free up more money for policing and to release more land for homes.Labour criticised Mr Bailey's support for Brexit in the EU referendum and said he was part of the Cameron government that implemented cuts to the Metropolitan Police.""London deserves so much better than this,"" Battersea MP Marsha de Cordova said."
2018-09-28,Adam Price replaces Wood as Plaid leader,https://web.archive.org//web/20180929005906/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-45656718,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAdam Price has won the Plaid Cymru leadership contest, taking nearly 50 per cent of the vote.The assembly member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr defeated Rhun ap Iorwerth and former leader Leanne Wood in a ballot of party members.Despite leading the party for six years, Ms Wood came last. In his victory address at the Novotel in Cardiff, Mr Price said: ""This election shows we are ready to lead again. Our time has come.""He told party members: ""Our message must be simple. Yes, Wales can.""The AM is the first openly gay assembly party leader in the history of the institution and leads the third largest group in the Senedd, behind Labour and the Tories.  Mr Price, who has vowed to put independence at the core of his party's message, said: ""There will be no second class travellers on our journey to a prosperous, self-confident and independent Wales.""""We must become the hope of those without hope.""Mr Price paid tribute to former leader Leanne Wood.""She has inspired thousands with her drive, her resilience and her unending commitment to the causes that she and we hold dear,"" he said.The leadership election began in the summer after Ynys Mon AM Mr ap Iorwerth and Mr Price challenged Ms Wood for her job.The Rhondda AM, who became leader in 2012, left the count in Cardiff declining to give interviews. She later tweeted her congratulations to Mr Price.Following the result Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Now it's about coming together under the new leadership of Adam Price to take forward that joint vision that we have of a new Wales, a new more confident Wales, out to the public and build towards the next assembly election.""Adam Price took 49.7% of first preference votes (2,863), while Rhun ap Iorwerth took 28% (1,613) and Leanne Wood 22.3% (1,286).After no candidate reached 50%, Ms Wood was knocked out and a second count began with the second preference votes of her supporters redistributed.This gave Mr Price 618 more votes and Mr ap Iorwerth 348.In the final totals, Mr Price beat Mr ap Iorwerth by 3,481 votes to 1,961.By Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editorIt's a bit of a shock to be honest.Not because of who won - Adam Price was widely expected to take this - but because of the way the incumbent Leanne Wood lost.It's a strange one, because she always polls as one of the most popular politicians in Wales.  She has UK recognition factor after taking part in general election TV debates, and yet somehow she has struggled to convert that popularity into widespread electoral success for Plaid Cymru.Adam Price, a former MP, is perhaps best known for his attempt to impeach Tony Blair over the Iraq war in 2004.Now in the assembly, he's a charismatic speaker, a big campaigner and a man of big ideas.The pressure on him now will be to deliver on them. Leader of the Conservative group in the assembly, Paul Davies, was one of the first to congratulate Mr Price on his victory, and said he looked forward to working with him in Cardiff Bay.""I hope that Adam realises that Plaid members have now signalled a new direction. This is a clear instruction to end Welsh Labour rule and that they should no longer prop them up,"" Mr Davies said.During the campaign candidates were questioned over whether they would work with the Conservatives in government.Leanne Wood said Mr Price and Rhun ap Iorwerth would ""quite possibly"" strike a deal with the Conservatives, but Mr Price rejected the idea of a coalition with the party.Adam Price told BBC Radio Cymru he did not want to enter a coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour.""No to both unionist parties. Both have let the people of Wales down,"" he said.Following the result Plaid Cymru's official Twitter account posted a video montage of Mr Price with dramatic music.It was deleted after the video was widely mocked on the social media network."

The gathering had more of an air of a collegiate conference than a demonstration.""We're all a long way out of our comfort zone,"" one head teacher said.""We asked each other on the bus if anyone had ever been to a protest before and nobody had,"" another added a little sheepishly.The participants may have felt cheerful, and maybe little awkward, but the mood was nonetheless serious.One head teacher from Suffolk told how she had been bitten by a pupil this week.""It wasn't his fault. It was because of a situation outside of school, and his emotional support had been cut two weeks earlier because of the cuts.""She could not give her name in case the pupil was identified, but she added: ""We have children who are distressed and angry and we can't help them.""Another Suffolk head teacher, Kelly Head from Springfield Infants School, said: ""It's head teachers here protesting because there's no one left.""We are using people left, right and centre to cover all sorts of jobs in schools. There's no one left.""The organisers of this grassroots protest highlight Institute of Fiscal Studies' claim that per pupil funding has fallen 8% in real terms since 2010.Their budgets have been squeezed by unfunded pay rises, national insurance payments, other cost pressures and rising pupil numbers.Others point to problems with England's new funding formula, which had been introduced to even out the amount which different local authorities receive per pupil.Tony Markham, head teacher of Herne Junior School in Petersfield, Hampshire, told how his budget will be Â£250,000 in deficit by 2020-21.The county has one of the lowest per pupil funding rates in the country, despite the new formula.Ella Palmer, head of a school in Alton, Hampshire, said her school had been using money from its capital budget to fund laptops.But these were now 14 years old, and the capital funding had been cut from Â£25,000 to Â£5,000 a year.Another Hampshire head, Joe Ayres, said: ""There just isn't enough money to do what we need to do.""Ms Head added: ""It's heart-breaking because the decisions we are beginning to have to make are about reducing social care and mental health support.""The government insists school funds will rise to a record Â£43.5bn by 2020 and that a new funding formula is bringing bring more cash to schools.National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) leader Paul Whiteman said head teachers were not really ""the marching type"" and if they were protesting, something must be ""seriously wrong"".This is the latest push in a campaign by school leaders to highlight the dangers of budget shortfalls and the different funding levels between schools.Education Secretary Damian Hinds has recognised that funding is one of the biggest concerns in his brief.A Department for Education spokesman said: ""There is more money going into schools than ever before, rising to a record Â£43.5bn by 2020 - 50% more in real terms per pupil than in 2000. ""Every school attracts more funding per pupil through the National Funding Formula, high needs funding has risen to over Â£6bn this year, and the 3.5% pay rise we announced for classroom teachers on the main pay range is backed by Â£508m government funding. ""We know that we are asking schools to do more, which is why we are helping them to reduce the Â£10bn spent each year on non-staffing costs, providing government-backed deals for things like printers and energy suppliers that are helping to save millions of pounds.""  But Stockport head teacher, Jim Nicholson, said he was fed up with hearing this government line.""We have seen how our colleagues are having to lay off staff and our vulnerable pupils are not getting support.""We'd all rather be back in school teaching. But we've had enough,"" he added.The head teachers taking part in the protest are from areas including:Blackpool â¢ Bolton â¢ Brighton and Hove â¢ Buckinghamshire â¢ Cambridgeshire â¢ Cheshire â¢ Cornwall â¢ Cumbria â¢ Derbyshire â¢ Devon â¢ Dorset â¢ Dudley, West Midlands â¢ East Sussex â¢ Essex â¢ Gloucestershire â¢ Greenwich â¢ Hampshire â¢ Hertfordshire â¢ Kent â¢ Kingston-upon-Thames â¢ Lancashire â¢ Liverpool â¢ London â¢ Norfolk â¢ Northampton â¢ Oxfordshire â¢ Peterborough â¢ Poole â¢ Portsmouth â¢ Richmond â¢ Rotherham â¢ Sheffield â¢ Slough â¢ Solihull, West Midlands â¢ Somerset â¢ Southend â¢ Southampton â¢ Staffordshire â¢ Suffolk â¢ Surrey â¢ Thurrock â¢ Walsall â¢ Warrington â¢ West Berkshire â¢ West Sussex â¢ Wigan â¢ Wiltshire â¢ Wokingham, Berkshire â¢ Wolverhampton â¢ Worcestershire"

Continuing to listen to all views on #Brexit and to explain EU positions, which aim for the UKâs orderly withdrawal and to build an ambitious future partnership together.End of Twitter post  by @MichelBarnierMr Corbyn was joined by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer for the talks, which come after Mr Corbyn told his party conference that he would back Theresa May if she proposed a ""sensible"" deal that kept the UK in a customs union with the EU.The PM has repeatedly ruled this out.Speaking after the meeting with Mr Barnier, Mr Corbyn said: ""We've had an interesting, useful discussion with Mr Barnier. We have set out the views of the Labour Party surrounding Brexit following the conference speeches made by Keir Starmer and myself.""We are obviously not negotiating. We are not in government, we are the opposition.""But he was interested to know what our views are and the six tests we have laid down by which we will hold our government in future.""Asked if Mr Barnier had offered views on Labour's Brexit plan, Mr Corbyn said: ""He made no opinion on this. It's not a negotiation, it's us informing him of what our views are and he telling us what the state of play was on the negotiations.""The Labour leader last met Mr Barnier, who is conducting the negotiations on behalf of the other 27 EU members, in July 2017.EU officials said the timing of Thursday's meeting, coming just days before the start of the Conservative Party conference, was a coincidence and stressed that it was not part of the negotiations.The meeting coincided with Mr Corbyn's trip to the Belgian capital to witness a square being renamed in honour of Jo Cox, the Labour MP who was murdered in June 2016.Speaking ahead of his meeting with Mr Barnier, Mr Corbyn said he would urge EU officials ""to do all they can to avoid a 'no-deal' outcome"": ""Crashing out of Europe with no deal risks being a national disaster."" Mrs May is under pressure to rethink her approach after European leaders warned key parts of her Chequers blueprint, which would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in trade in goods, for future relations with the EU were not viable.Up to 40 Tory Brexiteers have said they will oppose her plan if it comes to a vote in Parliament.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said talk of a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations - which Labour has said must remain an option - was ""deeply unhelpful"" to getting the best deal for Britain.But illustrating divisions within the Conservatives, his predecessor Amber Rudd told ITV's Peston that a new public vote was ""absolutely"" preferable to the UK leaving the EU next March without an agreement.And backbencher Nadine Dorries said Mrs May should step down as she had become ""handcuffed"" to the Chequers deal and was not communicating the benefits of Brexit. In his keynote leader's speech in Liverpool, Mr Corbyn said Labour would oppose a no-deal outcome and would also vote against any deal based on Chequers, as it would be extremely unlikely to meet the party's six tests, which include delivering the ""exact same benefits"" as members of the Single Market and Customs Union.But he said if the PM brought home a deal that ""includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland"", that protects jobs, people's rights at work and environmental and consumer standards, it would get his backing.Mrs May has rejected staying in any form of customs union, saying it will prevent the UK from signing trade deals with other countries and setting its own tariffs. Diplomats from the EU's 27 other members were briefed about the bloc's planning for a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday after a leaked document said the work had to intensify because of uncertainty about whether a final deal can be reached and approved by the UK and EU Parliaments."
2018-09-28,Derek Hatton applies to rejoin Labour,https://web.archive.org//web/20180929005906/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-45676556,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDerek Hatton has applied to rejoin the Labour Party, 33 years after being expelled by then-leader Neil Kinnock. The 70-year-old former deputy leader of Liverpool City Council, was booted out for belonging to Militant Tendency.During a bitter war with both Margaret Thatcher's government and the Labour leadership, he set an illegal budget and sent redundancy notices out by taxi to thousands of council workers.The Labour Party looks likely to accept the application.A source said any objection by the local party must be based on the rules and not on the basis of ""we don't like him"".Mr Hatton said he had no plans to run for public office and was inspired by Jeremy Corbyn's leadership to reapply for membership.He told the BBC it was too early to say how he might take part in the party but added: ""I will attend meetings.""Announcing his return in the Liverpool Echo, he said he spent much of the last 33 years at odds with the Labour leadership, particular at Tony Blair's decision to invade Iraq.However, he said he had remained committed to the party throughout the period and that the recent Labour conference had prompted him to rejoin.He wrote: ""In all my time I have never witnessed such passion, such energy and such powerful socialist leadership. And strangely that power is despite a kinder, gentler form of politics.""Many people, myself included, probably never thought we would witness an unswerving socialist like Jeremy Corbyn at the helm,"" he said.But his return to the party fold has received a mixed reaction from Liverpool Labour councillors.Clare McIntyre, who represents Wavertree ward, described the period when Mr Hatton in power as ""awful"".But Joann Kushner, who represents Croxteth said he was ""welcome"" and part of the city's ""phenomenal political history"".Mr Hatton hinted two years ago in a BBC interview that Mr Corbyn's leadership might tempt him back.Over the years the former firefighter has been a property developer, broadcaster and after-dinner speaker.The party had rejected his application to join in 2015.The Militant Tendency, which emerged from a Trotskyite group called the Revolutionary Socialist League, held key positions in the Liverpool Labour Party as it battled the Conservative Thatcher government in the 1980s.Its slogan ""It's better to break the law than break the poor"" led to the council setting a budget in 1985 which exceeded its income by Â£30m and led to political turmoil in the city.The slogan was cited by Labour frontbencher Dawn Butler this week on the eve of the party conference in Liverpool."

We can change the world, thank you.""Latest news and updates from YorkshireMrs Leadbeater said the family was ""honoured that the city of Brussels has chosen to remember Jo in this way"" but voiced concerns that little political progress had been made since her death.""I think a lot of people hoped that the violent assassination of a young mother of two small children on the streets where she grew up would have a profound and long-lasting effect on the political discourse in the UK and beyond.""However, over two years after, and despite many people working extremely hard to show that Jo's murder was not in vain, I'm sadly not at all sure that this was the case.""As well as being a celebration of Jo's life, I feel that today is also an opportune time to reflect on this.""Mrs Cox was included by the city of Brussels on a list of ""illustrious women"" who will have squares, streets and buildings named after them as part of the city's plans for female and male equality."

Theresa May insisted that her close friend and ally has been doing ""an excellent job"".She also said that every effort is being made to restore devolution in Northern Ireland. In an interview on the eve of the Conservative conference for BBC Northern Ireland, Theresa May said ""what matters is the job that Karen has been doing"". ""Of course I am disappointed that we still don't have the Executive up and running and the assembly running as it should be. But every effort is being made to do this,"" said Mrs May.""Karen is also obviously taking on board the need to ensure decisions will be able to be made by the civil service in NI while there is no executive in place.""The Prime Minister's vote of confidence came as Mrs Bradley gave a speech to the Northern Ireland Bureau in Washington DC calling on politicians to restore power sharing. She also stated that there is ""huge potential"" for Northern Ireland.Earlier this month, the Secretary of State told the Westminster House Magazine that she hadn't understood some of the"" deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland"", including how rare it is for unionist voters to back nationalist parties and vice versa. On Brexit, Mrs May repeated her promise to put forward new proposals on the so-called Irish backstop - an insurance policy intended to avoid a hard border - ""very shortly"". She again defended her much-criticised Chequers proposal, arguing that it offered the potential to ensure frictionless trade across the border. ""I have said to [the EU] if they have concerns with this issue of the border arrangements and the free trade area let's hear in details what those concerns are and if they have counter proposals let's hear those counter proposals,"" said Mrs May. After BBC Northern Ireland revealed that government officials are warning about the possibility of power cuts should Brexit disrupt the Single Electricity market within Ireland, Mrs May said she recognised the importance of the electricity sector. The Prime Minister argued that this sentiment is shared widely in Ireland and across the EU and work is under way to ensure the present arrangements for electricity supply are able to continue after the UK leaves the EU. Questioned about whether the Conservatives' parliamentary pact with the DUP has constrained their room for manoeuvre in the Brexit talks, Mrs May insisted that she is trying to deliver ""a proposal that works for the whole of the UK""."

During his visit to the UK in July, Mr Trump backtracked on claims he was said to have made in a newspaper interview that Mrs May's Brexit strategy made doing a trade deal harder - reports he described as fake news.Mr Trump has questioned the role of institutions like the UN, saying the ""ideology of globalism"" had run its course, and the US under his leadership was pursuing a ""doctrine of patriotism"". But in her speech to the UN, Mrs May sought to reassure those who fear the UK's departure from the EU next March will see the country turning in on itself and disengaging from pressing international problems. Citing the UK's continued membership of the G7, G20 and Nato among other collective bodies, she said there was ""no single model for balancing the democratic demands of our public with the imperative to co-operate internationally"".""The vote by the people to leave the EU was not a rejection of multilateralism or international co-operation.""It was a clear demand for decisions and accountability to lie closer to home. I believe the role of leadership in these circumstances is clear - it is delivering on the democratic wishes of our people and international co-operation, working with allies and partners in pursuit of our shared values.""The prime minister reiterated her continued support for an international deal on Iran's nuclear programme - which the US is pulling out of - and said other threats to the international order, like nuclear proliferation and state-sponsored terrorism, could only be addressed by countries working together. Earlier, Mrs May's approach to Brexit was questioned at a meeting of global business leaders in New York.The chief executive of the leading investment company, Blackstone, told her that from a risk management perspective, the future was ""daunting"".At a global business forum organised by Bloomberg, Steve Schwarzman asked the prime minister ""how bad things could get"" in the event of an unacceptable deal or the talks breaking down altogether.Mrs May repeated her confidence that a deal could be reached, but she acknowledged there was uncertainty.   She said there were still several weeks of intense negotiation to be done with the EU and argued that Brexit brought a ""sharper focus"" to existing efforts to prepare the UK economy for the future. But the BBC's political correspondent Ben Wright said her encounter with the big beasts of Wall Street did not always look comfortable and revealed again the concern many large companies have about Brexit."

At this week's party conference, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told delegates he wanted the party and the Jewish community to ""work together and draw a line"" under the anti-Semitism row.Indeed, relations have been strained for some time, with an inquiry into anti-Semitism in the party launched in 2016. Last month Labour adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism, although critics said the addition of a ""caveat"" undermined the international definition. Now, a study of results at the 2017 general election suggests some damage may already have been done before the row intensified this summer. It appears Labour may have underperformed in the constituencies with the most Jewish people.Across the UK, there are five constituencies where, according to the 2011 Census (the most recent), more than 10% of the population identify as Jewish.Four of them are in or just outside north London - Finchley and Golders Green, Hendon, Hertsmere, and Hackney North and Stoke Newington, where the local MP is shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. The fifth is Bury South, just outside Manchester.In these seats, Labour's share of the vote at the 2017 general election increased by seven points when compared with the 2015 election.However, this was nearly three points below the 9.8 point overall increase the party saw across the country. This underperformance appears to be greater still if we look at how constituencies voted in the 2016 EU referendum. In most cases, the higher the Remain vote was, the better Labour did in the election that followed.Once we take this into account, Labour's share of the vote in the constituencies with the most Jewish voters appears to be about 4.5 points below what might have been expected.In two constituencies, Finchley and Golders Green, and Hendon, this is greater than the margin by which it was beaten.Of course, we cannot be certain that the party's apparent difficulties in these seats was the result of its failure to win the support of Jewish voters. Labour might have had difficulties winning over the many other voters in these areas. Rival candidates may have fought a particularly good campaign.But it would be quite a coincidence if it had these problems in every seat with a large Jewish population.It is a problem that continued at local elections earlier this year, when the party failed to win Barnet (which incorporates Finchley and Golders Green), despite performing strongly elsewhere in the capital. Its failure prompted a senior Labour politician to say he ""suspects"" the anti-Semitism row was to blame.Despite these problems, Labour has found greater success with a different group of voters.Jeremy Corbyn has long campaigned against Islamophobia and his staunch opposition to the Iraq War is well documented. So, we might ask whether the Labour leader's record on such issues has enhanced support among Muslim voters.Certainly, the relationship was strained under Tony Blair, following his decision to join the US-led invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. The party lost ground heavily in 2005 in constituencies with large Muslim communities. Although much of that ground had been recovered by the 2015 general election, Labour did especially well in areas with large Muslim populations in 2017.There are 78 constituencies where more than 10% of people identify as Muslim, according to the 2011 Census.In these seats, Labour's vote increased by an average of 11.8 points - a couple of points better than its performance across the country as a whole.However, these were also seats where support for Remain was higher than in the UK overall - by about five points on average. But even when we take this into account, Labour's vote increased in these areas by just under a point more than we would otherwise have expected.More like thisThe difference this will have made to Labour's election performance is limited by the reality that most constituencies with a relatively large Muslim population are already safe Labour seats. Such a small advantage will have simply bolstered the party's already strong position locally. At most, there are a couple of seats, Keighley and Kensington, where Labour won only very narrowly and where any additional support from Muslims in these areas could conceivably have been decisive.However, in neither case can we say that this is what happened.About this pieceThis analysis piece is based on an extract of The British General Election of 2017 by Philip Cowley and Dennis Kavanagh.

The paper clarified that this meant electricity and heating, so not transport.The first thing to say is that the plan to achieve this by 2030 assumes that there will be a Labour government in place early next year.Capacity from solar power would be increased to 35,000MW, onshore wind to 30,000MW and offshore wind to 52,000MW. You can see from the chart above that those would be big increases, but Labour has given itself 12 years to achieve them.Let's start with solar power. The plan is a bit confusing because it says that the UK's solar capacity would be almost tripled to 35,000MW by 2030 ""with a combination of large and small-scale installations, installing solar PV [panels] on all viable UK roofs"".A viable roof is effectively any one that is structurally sound so that it can support the panels and facing any direction other than north, according to the industry.The Solar Trade Association told BBC Reality Check that the 35,000MW capacity from rooftop solar panels by 2030 could be achieved relatively easily, but that it would not require all viable roofs to have panels.You can see from the chart above that the rate at which new generating capacity was being installed, slowed after the government cut subsidies to households installing solar panels at the end of 2015. But the industry says that a big resource available to be exploited is the roofs of commercial and industrial properties.The plan for onshore wind involves having 6,000 more turbines by 2030. There are currently 7,638 onshore turbines either operational or under construction, so the number would be almost doubled.Offshore wind plans would involve adding 7,500 turbines to the existing 2,296 either operational or under construction, so that would more than quadruple the number of offshore turbines.The party plans to meet the demand for all the necessary ""turbine components, high voltage cables and the large supply chain of goods required, from lifting gear to electric control equipment"" through UK manufacturing.The industry body Renewable UK says that currently 48% of spending on planning, building and running UK offshore wind projects goes to firms in the UK.Examples include MHI Vestas Offshore Wind, which makes 80m-long blades on the Isle of Wight, Siemens Gamesa manufacturing blades and assembling offshore turbines in Hull and JDR Cables in Hartlepool, which supplies subsea cabling for offshore wind farms.BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh points out: ""It is unclear whether engineering companies are able to make parts for and construct turbines at the rate Mr Corbyn has promised."" The plans to make homes cheaper to heat and more energy efficient are the only part to which money has been allocated so far. Labour has set aside Â£12.8bn in its National Transformation Fund to cover the insulation programme in its first term, which will pay for the work to be done free for the homes of lower income owner-occupiers and those in social housing as well as zero interest loans to help those who are able to pay for the work.But as Pallab Ghosh points out: ""Successive governments have failed to persuade enough people to insulate their homes, even if it is for free.""What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-09-28,Laura Kuenssberg,https://web.archive.org//web/20180929005906/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45661781,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA few days before this Labour conference, one of Jeremy Corbyn's close allies suggested to me this would be the week that would demonstrate if Mr Corbyn has really transformed the Labour Party.Whether he meant the promises he made to his supporters when vowing to bring in a genuinely ""new kind of politics"".Well, Jeremy Corbyn has changed. His son Ben told us today, after his father's speech, that he was ""smoother"" now, and, excitedly, he claimed: ""There was a new centre emerging."" And yes, Labour has changed. Looking out on to the crowds chanting his name, their leader could be sure that hall, that audience, is behind him. After three years of angst, with some MPs trying to remove him, Mr Corbyn - or his team - have almost total control over his party and its mechanisms. MPs who were part of his early core of loyalists are understandably emboldened. MPs who despair of the leadership are mainly subdued, resigned to ""waiting it out"", as one described it.After the general election last year - and given the profound uncertainty in our politics right now - dissenters are unsure if their warnings that he could never win power were totally, and utterly, wrong. The bitterness between the two sides is still there, but the urgency has disappeared. As one insider described it, ""when you fight all the time, it's just exhausting"". To an extent, those Labour people who battled Corbyn and his enthusiastic supporters are simply too tired of it right now to carry on. But hold on a minute - not everything has gone according to the script. The rule changes that would make it easier for activists to change MPs, easier for members to have a say over policy, easier for members to influence the party's direction, did not sweep through without obstacle. And in setting policy through the National Policy Forum - a formal process - or trying to influence Labour in local government, or changing the selection rules, the changes that were meant to add up to a wholesale transformation of the party have not gone as far as originally intended. That's partly because when you scratch beneath the surface, there's a profound debate happening in all parts of the Labour Party about what comes next. Sure, in the immediate future, they are hopeful that a general election could emerge out of some chaotic post-Brexit vote, that could see them ride into power. But whatever the short term brings, with all its unpredictable scenarios, there is also a conversation about the long term. Some senior figures genuinely believe that the changes that have been wrought so far are just the beginning. The future for Labour, they argue, is in a mass movement where members have the control. In the optimistic version of this, Labour could build an entirely new model for British politics, with Jeremy Corbyn as the symbol for that new style, where members of the public who choose to join the party have their say. The darker scenario that could emerge, some MPs fear, is that rather than spending their time challenging their opponents in Westminster, scrutinising policy and representing all their constituents, they are consumed by a semi-permanent campaign to keep local activists happy - in order to keep their jobs. It's easier to argue for greater accountability and greater democracy, but those cautious about the idea argue it's just plain naÃ¯ve to imagine that those changes would not have a profound and negative impact on the job MPs do in Parliament. And there are frustrations on both sides. Plenty of people, whether in the Parliamentary party or in the unions, or in Momentum, or local party level, are finding individual frustrations. It's worth noting that the unions have been a big part of the block on some of the more sweeping changes that Jeremy Corbyn's supporters wanted.Yes, he has had crucial backing from those big voices in order to keep his job in the last few years - particularly vital still is the voice of Len McCluskey - but the unions have, no doubt, applied the brakes on some of the things that could have happened. Precisely in the same way they tried to do in previous times. As one shadow cabinet minister said: ""The right of the party never managed to completely subdue the unions, the left won't do it either."" They still pay the bills. The bitter fights about changes to this rule or that rule - and union resistance to them - are not about what happens to Jeremy Corbyn, but about what comes next. One senior figure told me: ""I'd rather gamble on the future leadership of the unions than on a huge bunch of activists."" Labour has changed, and changed dramatically, but some things stay the same. There is ""a shudder in the air"" - not about Mr Corbyn's leadership, Labour has made an uneasy peace with that - but about what remains when his days as leader are over. In volatile political times, of course, events, rather than Labour's own dilemmas, are likely to shape what happens. But beyond Liverpool this week, beyond the fringe, beyond the hall, there is a question being asked in Labour circles: is Jeremy Corbyn's leadership the start, or the end?"
2018-09-28,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180929005906/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45640548,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowShadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed the Labour Party is preparing to vote against whatever deal Theresa May brings back from negotiations with the European Union. What is Labour's Brexit policy, and what does it think should happen next?First of all, Labour says the government's Brexit proposals are failing to meet the six tests that Labour set out last year.Labour says these are the tests against which it will judge any final Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May's government, as part of the Article 50 negotiations on leaving the EU. They are: Labour has now published a report, which says all six of the tests are ""on course to be failed"".""Let me be very clear - right here, right now,"" Sir Keir told the BBC. ""If Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts.""But there are buts. When you look at the tests it is hardly surprising that they are on course to be failed, because of the way Labour set them out in the first place, as a way to judge the final Brexit deal. What is being negotiated between the UK and the EU now is the withdrawal agreement - the terms of divorce, rather than the precise detail of the future relationship. So it's not the final deal, and that makes some of the tests rather hard to assess fully at this stage. Take test number one: does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the EU? No-one can ensure that at the moment, and we probably won't know for sure until long after we've left. If a deal on a withdrawal agreement is done, it will be accompanied by a non-binding political declaration, which will presumably gush enthusiastically about a strong partnership in the future. Please upgrade your browserBoth sides want a strong partnership; they will remain neighbours. But the details will have to be negotiated later. A political declaration would set the tone and give some detail, but it could still lead to a blind Brexit: in other words, leaving without knowing our final destination.Take test number two: does a deal give the UK the ""exact same benefits"" as membership of the single market and the customs union? Well there's only really one way to achieve the ""exact same benefits"" and that's staying in the single market and the customs union, which is not official Labour policy. Labour says it wants to stay in ""a"" customs union, and stay as close to the single market as possible. That is not the same as membership, so you can argue that even current Labour policy would fail its own test. Labour is keen to emphasise that the six tests are based on promises and commitments the government made about what it would achieve in Brexit negotiations. So this process was certainly a way of holding the government to account. But the tests were also broad enough to cope with divisions within the Labour party about the best way forward. Now, though, the six tests have led to a decisive moment - barring unexpected developments, Labour will vote against a Brexit deal, increasing the chances that it will get rejected. Sir Keir says that's because the government has ""no credible plan"" for Brexit. But does the Labour party have one?Sir Keir confirmed that Labour wanted a general election if the government was defeated in a ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit, although Jeremy Corbyn later said he would also try to send the government back to Brussels to negotiate again.In other words, very little in Labour's Brexit strategy appears to be set in stone. The trouble with the idea of calling for another election is that it's not in Labour's gift. If Prime Minister Theresa May decided to call for an election, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act two-thirds of MPs would have to vote in favour (or go through a no-confidence procedure). And even if a snap election were to take place, it's not clear what would be in a Labour manifesto. Would it include explicit support for another referendum? Would it openly support staying in the single market, even on an interim basis?What we do know is that under the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act, the government would have 21 days to tell Parliament what it intended to do next if MPs rejected a Brexit deal in a ""meaningful vote"". Debates would have to take place in the House of Commons and the House of Lords within seven days. But what would be debated?These are obviously uncharted waters, and it may be up to the Speaker to decide whether any motions to be considered in parliament at that time could be amended, to allow, for example, for MPs to call for another referendum.The government's thinking on the Speaker's role is set out in this Written Ministerial Statement.Pushing for another referendum may well become Labour's main strategy, if it is unable to force an election. In his speech to conference, Sir Keir said the party had to be able to put forward alternatives to leaving the EU with no deal, including - crucially - campaigning for a public vote.   When the shadow Brexit secretary emphasised that nobody was ruling out Remain as an option in such a vote (a remark that was not in the text of the speech distributed to journalists) he received a standing ovation. But not everyone in the party was cheering.Groups like Labour Leave hold a very different view, arguing that ""throwing around the possibility of a second referendum is devastating to the party's brand"". And even within the shadow cabinet there are differences of opinion about the best Brexit strategy to pursue. Leaving the European Union involves big decisions about the way the country is run, bigger than this generation of politicians has faced before. So it is not surprising that the arguments within both Labour and the Conservatives go well beyond traditional party loyalties. But time is running very short for those decisions to be made.

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK but talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan, which was the UK's official view of a proposed Brexit deal.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May held an awayday for the cabinet at her country residence - Chequers - in July. At this gathering a favoured UK position for Brexit talks was agreed. It included proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals and says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanFollowing the European Council President Donald Tusk's rejection of the Chequers plan after the EU's September gathering, there has been mounting speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. One of Mrs May's repeated phrases has been that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". A wide-range of documents setting out the probable state of play if the UK leaves the EU without a deal has been recently published by the government. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but a group of Tory MPs have endorsed a plan for a ""clean break"" with the EU.Reality Check: The case for a 'clean-break' BrexitBrexit papers: What no deal could meanPet travel warning in no-deal Brexit planBritain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

""When we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government. Investing in Britain after years of austerity and neglect and bringing our country together after a decade of division,"" he told delegates, to cheers.He told them ""the old way of running things isn't working anymore"" and Labour's better-than-expected election result last year showed voters were ready for something new.""Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.""But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.""People in this country know - they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn't working any more."" AnalysisThe Labour conference is more at ease with itself this year, and this speech was designed to show the rest of the country that that party has solid, credible, worked-out answers for the questions of the day.Scepticism about his programme still runs far and wide in the parliamentary party at Westminster.But this Liverpool gathering has more or less, despite tensions over the EU, shown that Labour has moved on from the turmoil when Mr Corbyn first took over.Party conferences are always a shop window for leaders to show their wares to the rest of the country.Read more from LauraLabour members voted on Tuesday to keep all options on the table - including a fresh referendum - if there is no Brexit deal with Brussels.Mr Corbyn said in his speech he would support Theresa May on Brexit - if she got a ""sensible"" deal that included a customs union that prevented the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland and protected workers' rights.He said Labour would vote against the PM's Chequers plan ""or whatever is left of it"" and oppose leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would be a ""national disaster"".But he told Mrs May: ""If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people's rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. ""A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.""But if you can't negotiate that deal then you need to make way for a party that can and will.""This call, delivered with venom by Mr Corbyn, went down well in the hall. Delegates gave their leader a standing ovation and there was an outbreak of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"".Mrs May has consistently ruled out a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader also used his speech to announce plans to create 400,000 skilled jobs with new investment in fresh wind farms and insulation for homes.He pointed to Labour's commitment to reduce the UK's net carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 - and to zero by 2050.Labour's energy plans would ""make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations"", said Mr Corbyn.And they would bring ""skills and security to communities held back for too long"", in all parts of the UK.Turning to the row over anti-Semitism in Labour, Mr Corbyn said it had caused ""immense hurt and anxiety"" and there was a standing ovation as he told Jewish people: ""We are your ally.""Being anti-racist was ""integral to our very being"", he went on, adding that he would not accept being accused of anti-Semitism by ""Tory hypocrites"", criticising the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and MEPs' ""support"" for the Hungarian government of Viktor Orban.On foreign policy, Mr Corbyn said evidence ""now points clearly to the Russian state"" as being responsible for the Salisbury poisoning and promised ""no more reckless wars of intervention"" like those in Iraq and Libya.And he condemned the actions of Israeli forces in Gaza, calling for a ""secure Israel and a viable and secure Palestinian state"".Labour would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it takes office, he said, ""in order to help make that two-state settlement a reality"".Earlier in his speech, to applause in the arena, he attacked parts of the British press, saying billionaire newspapers owners did not like Labour ""one little bit"".He called on supporters to challenge their ""propaganda of privilege"", using ""the mass media of the 21st century"" - social media.Freedom of the press must be protected, he said: ""But here, a free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful.""Mr Corbyn said Labour would put ""fairness and humanity"" back into public services, pointing to pledges to increase the number of police officers and expand free childcare.Labour has used its week in Liverpool to announce a string of new policies, building on those contained in its 2017 general election manifesto.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell unveiled plans to force large companies to give staff 1% of their shares a year, netting them up to Â£500 a year each.He also set out plans to ""democratise"" the economy by renationalising the water industry, which he said would hand power to workers, consumers and local councils. Further nationalisations - of the rail, mail and energy industries - would follow under a Labour government.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the speech showed Mr Corbyn ""was unfit to govern"" and would ""open the door to re-running the referendum"".The SNP said the Scottish government was already delivering on issues mentioned in the speech such as tough climate change targets, a publicly-owned bid to run Scotland's railways and free sanitary products in schools.And Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn must listen to his party members and support the campaign to stop Brexit. The CBI business group's director general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was ""much common ground between business and Labour"" but warned that ""continual public barbs and backward-facing policy are deterring entrepreneurs and investors, at a time when we need them most"".Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""That speech was inspiring. We heard a Labour leader draw a very clear line under the failed policies of the past, policies that have caused despair and division in our communities, and then set out a distinctive, different, positive Labour programme for the country.""The British Chambers of Commerce said there were some ""bright spots"" but ""Jeremy Corbyn missed a golden opportunity to extend an olive branch to British business""."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-09-29,May: Brexit plan critics are playing politics,https://web.archive.org//web/20180930041005/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45696015,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThose who refuse to back the Chequers plan for Brexit are ""playing politics"" with the UK's future, Theresa May says.In the Sunday Times, Mrs May stressed again that her plan was the only workable strategy, and signalled she had a ""long-term"" job to do as PM.Speaking ahead of the party conference in Birmingham, she also announced plans to charge foreign home-buyers more tax, and proposals for a national festival.But ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson called her Brexit approach ""deranged"".The prime minister says her plan for the UK and EU to share a ""common rulebook"" for goods, but not services, is the only credible way to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The strategy has been fiercely criticised by Brexiteers, who say it would compromise the UK's sovereignty and betray the 2016 referendum vote.And writing in the Sunday Telegraph, ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve warned the PM she faced a ""polite rebellion"" by pro-EU MPs, with a ""significant"" number prepared to back another referendum if a deal could not be reached.Meanwhile, the Conservative Party has apologised after a technical issue with its conference app meant Tory MPs had their phone numbers and other personal data revealed. The issue has since been resolved, the party said.The UK's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, said it would investigate the breach.In her Sunday Times interview, Mrs May said: ""The only proposal on the table at the moment that delivers... is the Chequers plan.""She challenged the EU to come forward with counter-proposals, while saying of Labour, ""you can't believe what they say"".Both have declared her plan to be unworkable, and last week Labour members voted to keep the option of another referendum open if MPs were not happy with the final deal reached.Mrs May's message to Tory MPs was that the party ""always puts country first and puts the national interest first"".  She was ""not bluffing"" when she said ""no deal is better than a bad deal"", Mrs May added to the Sun on Sunday, but she thought a good deal could be reached. On other matters, Mrs May told the Times: ""There's a long-term job to do. Because it is not just about Brexit, it's about the domestic agenda as well.""She said people and businesses who did not pay tax in Britain would face a higher stamp duty levy of up to 3% when they bought property in the UK - to stop them driving up house prices. The money would be used to combat rough sleeping.She also revealed plans for a Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to showcase the nation in January 2022 - months before the next scheduled general election.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock said health officials would produce guidelines on the amount of time young people should spend on social media.Mr Johnson - who quit the cabinet in July in protest at the Chequers plan - again challenged Mrs May's position, telling the Sunday Times that he, unlike the PM, had campaigned for Brexit.  On Friday,  he described her approach as ""simply intolerable"" and refused to rule out a leadership challenge.Mr Johnson also set out domestic policy ideas, including building a bridge between Britain and Ireland and putting the HS2 scheme on hold to focus on a rail link in northern England.Meanwhile, Mr Grieve warned the Brexit row was ""paralysing government"" and damaging the Conservatives' reputation.""A no-deal Brexit is a proposal so damaging to our future that it cannot be accepted,"" he wrote.""So the only possible response must be to return to the British electorate and ask them what they want. That, it seems to me, is good pragmatic Conservative position.""The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations on the terms of exit and future co-operation are continuing.

2018-09-29,UK would 'forever regret' losing carmakers,https://web.archive.org//web/20180930041005/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45693341,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK ""would regret it forever"" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.He added it was ""concerning"" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby. ""We need a deal,"" Mr Clark said.The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs. The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.""My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory,"" said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston. Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Toyota's production line is run on a ""just-in-time"" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped. Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is ""precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border"". ""We need to have a deal... we want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.""Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs. Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: ""In my experience once these jobs go they never come back. ""And that's why we have to do everything possible to keep these jobs in the area.""A government spokesperson said: ""We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU. ""As part of this we have proposed a UK-EU free trade area underpinned by a common rulebook on manufactured goods, such as automotives.""Started production December 1992 Employs 2,564 (inc 322 agency) Produces Auris and Avensis - including pressing body panels, welding and assemblySite is 580 acres - 2.35 million square metresTotal vehicles produced: 144,077, of which Avensis: 25,057, Auris: 34,899 and Auris Hybrid: 84,121"

She shared a redacted picture of Mr Johnson's profile, which did not reveal his phone number.It appears that people could access an MP's personal details by entering their email address, without a password, when pressing the attendee's button in the app. This button has since been removed on the app, which was created by Australian firm Crowd Comms.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the app was ""now functioning securely"" and the party would be ""investigating the issue further"".On Thursday the Evening Standard reported Mr Lewis was set to ""unveil the first 'interactive' conference app"" on Sunday in a bid to overhaul the Conservatives image, and appealing to the younger voter.Theresa May arrives at #CPC18 in Birmingham - faced with shouts of âhave you checked out the conference app?â ... the Tories will want a glitch free few days - this data breach is not a good start pic.twitter.com/KLdF37HrtfEnd of Twitter post  by @robpowellnewsPrime Minister Theresa May, who was arriving at the conference in Birmingham, ignored questions from reporters about the security blunder.The Press Association said the details of Environment Secretary Michael Gove had also been shared online. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent, in BirminghamOn the very day Business Secretary Greg Clark expressed concern about Facebook's security breach, the Conservative Party has had to say sorry for its own.This conference hasn't even started yet, but officials are already rattled.One Conservative source described it to me in very colourful, unbroadcastable terms, in a text message he sent me by accident.Was this a breach of national security? No. Was it an unforced error the party could do without, and a bumpy start to what was already likely to be a bumpy conference? Yes.And this may well not be the end of it, with the Information Commissioner's Office now involved.Pictures on Twitter show people apparently changing individuals' profile pictures and leaving messages on the app's internal messaging system.One Twitter user posted a snapshot of Mr Gove's profile picture, which had been changed to a snap of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.Mr Gove previously worked as a journalist at The Times, one of Mr Murdoch's papers. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it would be making inquiries about the breach and added that ""organisations have a legal duty to keep personal data safe and secure"". The ICO's statement added under the EU's new GDPR regulation, the Conservative Party has 72 hours to notify the regulator of a personal data breach that ""could pose a risk to people's rights and freedoms"".One of Labour's shadow cabinet, Jon Trickett, criticised the Conservatives for the breach and said: ""How can we trust this Tory government with our country's security when they can't even build a conference app that keeps the data of their members, MPs and others attending safe?""Labour's grassroots campaign group Momentum said their party's app had been developed by a team of volunteers, adding: ""I'm sure they'd be happy to give the Tories a few tips next year.""The Conservative Party conference is being held in Birmingham and is due to start on Sunday.

2018-09-29,Tory MP Heidi Allen backs new Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20180930041005/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45690898,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA Conservative MP says she sees no alternative other than backing another referendum on leaving the EU. Heidi Allen becomes the latest Tory to support a new vote, saying the ""right-wing"" of her party had made Theresa May's Chequers Brexit plan - ""dead"".""They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands,"" she told the BBC.The prime minister has ruled out a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.Mrs May's Chequers plan - which would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in trade in goods - has been heavily criticised by Tory Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson. Ms Allen - who campaigned to Remain in the EU in 2016 - told Radio 4's Today programme that while she would still support in principle an ""11th hour"" deal from Mrs May and the EU, ""too many"" of her party - especially those on the right - would not. The South Cambridgeshire MP said she had been left with ""no alternative other than asking - should we come to that, no deal, that looks like that's what's going to happen - then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next."" On what a further referendum could look like, Ms Allen suggested that it should include the option of staying in the EU under existing terms.By Jessica Parker, political correspondentHeidi Allen joins a handful of Tory backbenchers who've openly said a so-called people's vote may now be needed. And as someone who supported Remain, her comments may come as no surprise. But, perhaps more significantly, she is the latest person to suggest that Theresa May's Chequers plan is dead. The blueprint, for our future relationship with the EU, has never been liked by the Leave supporting contingent. But people like Heidi Allen had previously said that they would at least give Chequers a chance. No more. It comes as Labour - not to mention the EU - has also declared that the proposals are unworkable in their current form. And while Number 10 is sticking to its guns, there must be a big question as to how long this situation can be sustained.The People's Vote campaign group wants to give the public the final say over whether the UK leaves the EU, arguing that voters should be given a choice  between leaving with or without a deal or staying on current terms.Anna Soubry, Justine Greening and Sarah Wollaston are among the Conservative MPs who have supported a further referendum. Ms Allen's comments come after ex-PM Sir John Major also made the case for another Brexit vote and highlighted the ""completely unacceptable"" attacks by certain Tory MPs on Mrs May. Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson set out his ""better Brexit plan"" and refused to rule out a leadership challenge.Last week Labour members voted to keep the option of another referendum on the table if parliament is deadlocked over the final outcome the government's Brexit negotiations.The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations on the terms of exit and future co-operation are continuing.The Conservative party is gathering in Birmingham for its annual conference.

The former shadow chancellor is the latest of a number of vocal critics of party leader Jeremy Corbyn to face such votes.The result carries no official weight but recent changes to party rules make it easier to remove sitting MPs.Mr Leslie and supporters boycotted the meeting, saying he had been unfairly targeted.Mr Leslie has represented the constituency since 2010. He stepped down as shadow chancellor when Jeremy Corbyn won the leadership.Louise Regan, chair of the Nottingham East Labour Party, said: ""We have overwhelmingly passed a vote of no confidence in Chris Leslie the MP.""But actually our biggest focus is to go out tomorrow campaigning because what we want is to elect a Labour government.""Mr Leslie said: ""Sadly differing opinions are no longer tolerated in some parts of the Labour Party.""But I have to weigh the views of a few dozen people at this meeting with the thousands who voted for me at the last election."" Others to face no confidence votes from their local parties are Luton South MP Gavin Shuker, Joan Ryan, MP for Enfield North, and Frank Field who quit the parliamentary party earlier this month.Such votes carry no official force within the Labour Party but local activists could hold a ""trigger ballot"", where sitting Labour MPs can be forced to compete for selection as a candidate against all-comers, ahead of the next general election."

Earlier this month Conservative MPs opposed to the PM's plan met to discuss how and when they could force her to stand down.Speaking at an event in South Shields alongside the former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, Sir John said: ""I do not think routine attacks on the PM in the most lurid fashion is either the spirit of politics that one would wish to see, or is it in the interest of the negotiating posture of the United Kingdom.""He did not mention any MP by name, but said: ""When I look at the alternatives to the prime minister I am drawn even more closely to her.""He added that ""the threats that come in her direction of a leadership election unless she delivers a certain sort of Brexit... [went] far beyond anything that I would think was remotely acceptable in behaviour towards any prime minister"".And he underlined the ""inability of those who level these taunts to actually come up with any coherent plan of any sort themselves"". In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Friday, Mr Johnson repeatedly refused to rule out challenging Mrs May for the Tory leadership, instead saying, ""My job is to speak up for what I believe in"".Mrs May would stay in office ""as long as she feels it necessary"", he added. He also restated his opposition to Mrs May's Chequers plan, warning it would be ""a political and economic disaster"" for the country.Elsewhere, Sir John reiterated his belief that the UK public should be allowed to vote again on leaving the EU - because the argument made in favour of Brexit at the 2016 referendum had been ""a fantasy"".""Almost nothing that was said has turned out to be the case,"" he said.The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations on the terms of exit and future co-operation are continuing. The Conservative Party conference is due to start in Birmingham."

A government source said Mr Johnson was ""regurgitating ideas"", not coming up with any new answers.Mr Johnson quit the cabinet in July in protest at Mrs May's plan for future economic co-operation with the EU, which he says will curb the UK's sovereignty and betray the 2016 referendum vote. His latest attack on Mrs May's policy, which would see the UK sign up to a common rule book for trade in goods, comes two days before the start of the Conservative Party conference.In an article for the Daily Telegraph on Friday, Mr Johnson claimed the Chequers plan was ""a moral and intellectual humiliation"" for the UK and it was not too late for Mrs May to back a ""super Canada"" deal, which is favoured by many Tory Brexiteers. Speaking to the BBC's political editor, in his first interview since quitting the cabinet, he rejected suggestions he was simply trying to make life difficult for the prime minister, describing Theresa May as a ""remarkable person"". ""As she said to us herself and she said to the country...she will go for as long as she feels it necessary.""He urged Mrs May to ""get back"" to the principles he said she had initially set out in Brexit negotiations before, in his words, being ""blown off course"" by the 2017 general election. Asked to rule out a leadership challenge if this did not happen, he replied: ""My job is to speak up for what I believe in and the vision that I've set out today and I believe in it very very sincerely.""I'm going to keep going for as long as it takes.""He added: ""The most important thing for me is to avert what I think would be a political and economic disaster for this country. To come out of the EU but still to be run by the EU - what is the point of that?"" By BBC Political Editor Laura KuenssbergIt is no secret that he still wants and believes he has a shot at Number 10.And having turned down interviews for several months after his departure from government, speaking out today on the eve of the Conservative conference outwardly appears designed to stir as much trouble as possible.Mr Johnson is adamant, of course, that what he is really involved in is trying to change Number 10's policy, rather than trying to shove Theresa May out.Read Laura's blogThe Chequers plan was ""unacceptable"" to the British public, he said, and it was ""pie in the sky"" to suggest, as some have done, that it could be modified after the UK's exit from the EU on 29 March, 2019. ""It will do lasting damage to the credibility of this country around the world. People will say the UK is a greater power, a great economy. Why are they so passive and so supine as to remain in the orbit of Brussels.""Asked whether he was prepared to actually vote down a deal based on Chequers if it came to it in Parliament, and potentially see the UK leaving without a deal, he said: ""You will have to see.""But he added: ""At the moment, I cannot see how I can support Chequers, I have to be honest.""In response, a government source said: ""Boris was a member of the Cabinet that agreed the December Joint Report and praised the PM for doing so.""The truth is that reneging on those things would simply guarantee no deal.""And Tory MP Sir Alan Duncan - a junior minister in Mr Johnson's old department - said his former boss was addicted to media attention.""Publicity is his cocaine. He needs a regular fix,"" the foreign office minister told The Spectator. But, he added, Mr Johnson's power as an ""electoral asset"" was ""now waning"".The UK and EU are seeking to negotiate the terms of exit, as well as an outline agreement on future cooperation by the middle of November at the latest. But the European Parliament's representative in Brexit talks warned the UK it will not approve a relationship with the UK where EU nationals were discriminated against by nationality or type of job.Referring to the cabinet's recent decision that EU nationals would not be privileged in the UK's new immigration regime, Guy Verhoftsadt said the system for EU citizens coming to the UK after Brexit would likely be reciprocated for British citizens moving in the other direction.

2018-09-29,Bailey chosen as Tory mayoral candidate,https://web.archive.org//web/20180930041005/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-45677156,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowShaun Bailey will contest the 2020 London mayoral election for the Conservatives, it has been announced.The 47-year-old said tackling crime and building affordable homes would be some of his priorities if he is elected.The former special advisor to David Cameron beat his fellow London Assembly Member Andrew Boff and Ealing Councillor Joy Morrissey.In May 2016, Labour's Sadiq Khan beat Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith.Boris Johnson remains the only Conservative mayor of London, following election victories in 2008 and 2012.Privately some Conservatives have suggested Shaun Bailey may be a little lightweight.  He told me today that couldn't be further from the truth. But he will know the task ahead will be a tough one. Like his fellow Conservative contenders, he is in favour of Brexit and hopes to lead a city that was the only region in England to vote to remain. Labour has also done well in London in recent years and has more councils, councillors and MPs than the Conservatives. It also has a much larger membership in the capital, foot soldiers who can cover the hard yards needed in a campaign. Bailey was picked in a contest in which just over 7,000 Conservatives voted - about half of their London membership. Much will be expected of them as they, and Londoners, get to know their new candidate.  Mr Bailey said: ""It is a great honour to be selected as the Conservative Party's candidate for the 2020 London mayoral election. ""For someone who grew up in a council house in one of the poorest parts of London, securing this nomination is proof that our city truly is the place where anything is possible.""London has given me so much. ""It's why I've spent my entire adult life trying to repay its generosity, either through my twenty plus years of youth work helping to steer children away from a life of crime and towards work opportunities, or my current involvement on the London Assembly, where I have done my best to hold the current mayor to account.""He has vowed to cut City Hall bureaucracy to free up more money for policing and to release more land for homes.Labour criticised Mr Bailey's support for Brexit in the EU referendum and said he was part of the Cameron government that implemented cuts to the Metropolitan Police.""London deserves so much better than this,"" Battersea MP Marsha de Cordova said."
2018-09-29,Adam Price replaces Wood as Plaid leader,https://web.archive.org//web/20180930041005/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-45656718,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAdam Price has won the Plaid Cymru leadership contest, taking nearly 50 per cent of the vote.The assembly member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr defeated Rhun ap Iorwerth and former leader Leanne Wood in a ballot of party members.Despite leading the party for six years, Ms Wood came last. In his victory address at the Novotel in Cardiff, Mr Price said: ""This election shows we are ready to lead again. Our time has come.""He told party members: ""Our message must be simple. Yes, Wales can.""The AM is the first openly gay assembly party leader in the history of the institution and leads the third largest group in the Senedd, behind Labour and the Tories.  Mr Price, who has vowed to put independence at the core of his party's message, said: ""There will be no second class travellers on our journey to a prosperous, self-confident and independent Wales.""""We must become the hope of those without hope.""Mr Price paid tribute to former leader Leanne Wood.""She has inspired thousands with her drive, her resilience and her unending commitment to the causes that she and we hold dear,"" he said.The leadership election began in the summer after Ynys Mon AM Mr ap Iorwerth and Mr Price challenged Ms Wood for her job.The Rhondda AM, who became leader in 2012, left the count in Cardiff declining to give interviews. She later tweeted her congratulations to Mr Price.Following the result Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Now it's about coming together under the new leadership of Adam Price to take forward that joint vision that we have of a new Wales, a new more confident Wales, out to the public and build towards the next assembly election.""Adam Price took 49.7% of first preference votes (2,863), while Rhun ap Iorwerth took 28% (1,613) and Leanne Wood 22.3% (1,286).After no candidate reached 50%, Ms Wood was knocked out and a second count began with the second preference votes of her supporters redistributed.This gave Mr Price 618 more votes and Mr ap Iorwerth 348.In the final totals, Mr Price beat Mr ap Iorwerth by 3,481 votes to 1,961.By Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editorIt's a bit of a shock to be honest.Not because of who won - Adam Price was widely expected to take this - but because of the way the incumbent Leanne Wood lost.It's a strange one, because she always polls as one of the most popular politicians in Wales.  She has UK recognition factor after taking part in general election TV debates, and yet somehow she has struggled to convert that popularity into widespread electoral success for Plaid Cymru.Adam Price, a former MP, is perhaps best known for his attempt to impeach Tony Blair over the Iraq war in 2004.Now in the assembly, he's a charismatic speaker, a big campaigner and a man of big ideas.The pressure on him now will be to deliver on them. Leader of the Conservative group in the assembly, Paul Davies, was one of the first to congratulate Mr Price on his victory, and said he looked forward to working with him in Cardiff Bay.""I hope that Adam realises that Plaid members have now signalled a new direction. This is a clear instruction to end Welsh Labour rule and that they should no longer prop them up,"" Mr Davies said.During the campaign candidates were questioned over whether they would work with the Conservatives in government.Leanne Wood said Mr Price and Rhun ap Iorwerth would ""quite possibly"" strike a deal with the Conservatives, but Mr Price rejected the idea of a coalition with the party.Adam Price told BBC Radio Cymru he did not want to enter a coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour.""No to both unionist parties. Both have let the people of Wales down,"" he said.Following the result Plaid Cymru's official Twitter account posted a video montage of Mr Price with dramatic music.It was deleted after the video was widely mocked on the social media network."

At this week's party conference, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told delegates he wanted the party and the Jewish community to ""work together and draw a line"" under the anti-Semitism row.Indeed, relations have been strained for some time, with an inquiry into anti-Semitism in the party launched in 2016. Last month Labour adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism, although critics said the addition of a ""caveat"" undermined the international definition. Now, a study of results at the 2017 general election suggests some damage may already have been done before the row intensified this summer. It appears Labour may have underperformed in the constituencies with the most Jewish people.Across the UK, there are five constituencies where, according to the 2011 Census (the most recent), more than 10% of the population identify as Jewish.Four of them are in or just outside north London - Finchley and Golders Green, Hendon, Hertsmere, and Hackney North and Stoke Newington, where the local MP is shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. The fifth is Bury South, just outside Manchester.In these seats, Labour's share of the vote at the 2017 general election increased by seven points when compared with the 2015 election.However, this was nearly three points below the 9.8 point overall increase the party saw across the country. This underperformance appears to be greater still if we look at how constituencies voted in the 2016 EU referendum. In most cases, the higher the Remain vote was, the better Labour did in the election that followed.Once we take this into account, Labour's share of the vote in the constituencies with the most Jewish voters appears to be about 4.5 points below what might have been expected.In two constituencies, Finchley and Golders Green, and Hendon, this is greater than the margin by which it was beaten.Of course, we cannot be certain that the party's apparent difficulties in these seats was the result of its failure to win the support of Jewish voters. Labour might have had difficulties winning over the many other voters in these areas. Rival candidates may have fought a particularly good campaign.But it would be quite a coincidence if it had these problems in every seat with a large Jewish population.It is a problem that continued at local elections earlier this year, when the party failed to win Barnet (which incorporates Finchley and Golders Green), despite performing strongly elsewhere in the capital. Its failure prompted a senior Labour politician to say he ""suspects"" the anti-Semitism row was to blame.Despite these problems, Labour has found greater success with a different group of voters.Jeremy Corbyn has long campaigned against Islamophobia and his staunch opposition to the Iraq War is well documented. So, we might ask whether the Labour leader's record on such issues has enhanced support among Muslim voters.Certainly, the relationship was strained under Tony Blair, following his decision to join the US-led invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. The party lost ground heavily in 2005 in constituencies with large Muslim communities. Although much of that ground had been recovered by the 2015 general election, Labour did especially well in areas with large Muslim populations in 2017.There are 78 constituencies where more than 10% of people identify as Muslim, according to the 2011 Census.In these seats, Labour's vote increased by an average of 11.8 points - a couple of points better than its performance across the country as a whole.However, these were also seats where support for Remain was higher than in the UK overall - by about five points on average. But even when we take this into account, Labour's vote increased in these areas by just under a point more than we would otherwise have expected.More like thisThe difference this will have made to Labour's election performance is limited by the reality that most constituencies with a relatively large Muslim population are already safe Labour seats. Such a small advantage will have simply bolstered the party's already strong position locally. At most, there are a couple of seats, Keighley and Kensington, where Labour won only very narrowly and where any additional support from Muslims in these areas could conceivably have been decisive.However, in neither case can we say that this is what happened.About this pieceThis analysis piece is based on an extract of The British General Election of 2017 by Philip Cowley and Dennis Kavanagh.

The paper clarified that this meant electricity and heating, so not transport.The first thing to say is that the plan to achieve this by 2030 assumes that there will be a Labour government in place early next year.Capacity from solar power would be increased to 35,000MW, onshore wind to 30,000MW and offshore wind to 52,000MW. You can see from the chart above that those would be big increases, but Labour has given itself 12 years to achieve them.Let's start with solar power. The plan is a bit confusing because it says that the UK's solar capacity would be almost tripled to 35,000MW by 2030 ""with a combination of large and small-scale installations, installing solar PV [panels] on all viable UK roofs"".A viable roof is effectively any one that is structurally sound so that it can support the panels and facing any direction other than north, according to the industry.The Solar Trade Association told BBC Reality Check that the 35,000MW capacity from rooftop solar panels by 2030 could be achieved relatively easily, but that it would not require all viable roofs to have panels.You can see from the chart above that the rate at which new generating capacity was being installed, slowed after the government cut subsidies to households installing solar panels at the end of 2015. But the industry says that a big resource available to be exploited is the roofs of commercial and industrial properties.The plan for onshore wind involves having 6,000 more turbines by 2030. There are currently 7,638 onshore turbines either operational or under construction, so the number would be almost doubled.Offshore wind plans would involve adding 7,500 turbines to the existing 2,296 either operational or under construction, so that would more than quadruple the number of offshore turbines.The party plans to meet the demand for all the necessary ""turbine components, high voltage cables and the large supply chain of goods required, from lifting gear to electric control equipment"" through UK manufacturing.The industry body Renewable UK says that currently 48% of spending on planning, building and running UK offshore wind projects goes to firms in the UK.Examples include MHI Vestas Offshore Wind, which makes 80m-long blades on the Isle of Wight, Siemens Gamesa manufacturing blades and assembling offshore turbines in Hull and JDR Cables in Hartlepool, which supplies subsea cabling for offshore wind farms.BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh points out: ""It is unclear whether engineering companies are able to make parts for and construct turbines at the rate Mr Corbyn has promised."" The plans to make homes cheaper to heat and more energy efficient are the only part to which money has been allocated so far. Labour has set aside Â£12.8bn in its National Transformation Fund to cover the insulation programme in its first term, which will pay for the work to be done free for the homes of lower income owner-occupiers and those in social housing as well as zero interest loans to help those who are able to pay for the work.But as Pallab Ghosh points out: ""Successive governments have failed to persuade enough people to insulate their homes, even if it is for free.""What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-09-29,Laura Kuenssberg,https://web.archive.org//web/20180930041005/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45661781,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA few days before this Labour conference, one of Jeremy Corbyn's close allies suggested to me this would be the week that would demonstrate if Mr Corbyn has really transformed the Labour Party.Whether he meant the promises he made to his supporters when vowing to bring in a genuinely ""new kind of politics"".Well, Jeremy Corbyn has changed. His son Ben told us today, after his father's speech, that he was ""smoother"" now, and, excitedly, he claimed: ""There was a new centre emerging."" And yes, Labour has changed. Looking out on to the crowds chanting his name, their leader could be sure that hall, that audience, is behind him. After three years of angst, with some MPs trying to remove him, Mr Corbyn - or his team - have almost total control over his party and its mechanisms. MPs who were part of his early core of loyalists are understandably emboldened. MPs who despair of the leadership are mainly subdued, resigned to ""waiting it out"", as one described it.After the general election last year - and given the profound uncertainty in our politics right now - dissenters are unsure if their warnings that he could never win power were totally, and utterly, wrong. The bitterness between the two sides is still there, but the urgency has disappeared. As one insider described it, ""when you fight all the time, it's just exhausting"". To an extent, those Labour people who battled Corbyn and his enthusiastic supporters are simply too tired of it right now to carry on. But hold on a minute - not everything has gone according to the script. The rule changes that would make it easier for activists to change MPs, easier for members to have a say over policy, easier for members to influence the party's direction, did not sweep through without obstacle. And in setting policy through the National Policy Forum - a formal process - or trying to influence Labour in local government, or changing the selection rules, the changes that were meant to add up to a wholesale transformation of the party have not gone as far as originally intended. That's partly because when you scratch beneath the surface, there's a profound debate happening in all parts of the Labour Party about what comes next. Sure, in the immediate future, they are hopeful that a general election could emerge out of some chaotic post-Brexit vote, that could see them ride into power. But whatever the short term brings, with all its unpredictable scenarios, there is also a conversation about the long term. Some senior figures genuinely believe that the changes that have been wrought so far are just the beginning. The future for Labour, they argue, is in a mass movement where members have the control. In the optimistic version of this, Labour could build an entirely new model for British politics, with Jeremy Corbyn as the symbol for that new style, where members of the public who choose to join the party have their say. The darker scenario that could emerge, some MPs fear, is that rather than spending their time challenging their opponents in Westminster, scrutinising policy and representing all their constituents, they are consumed by a semi-permanent campaign to keep local activists happy - in order to keep their jobs. It's easier to argue for greater accountability and greater democracy, but those cautious about the idea argue it's just plain naÃ¯ve to imagine that those changes would not have a profound and negative impact on the job MPs do in Parliament. And there are frustrations on both sides. Plenty of people, whether in the Parliamentary party or in the unions, or in Momentum, or local party level, are finding individual frustrations. It's worth noting that the unions have been a big part of the block on some of the more sweeping changes that Jeremy Corbyn's supporters wanted.Yes, he has had crucial backing from those big voices in order to keep his job in the last few years - particularly vital still is the voice of Len McCluskey - but the unions have, no doubt, applied the brakes on some of the things that could have happened. Precisely in the same way they tried to do in previous times. As one shadow cabinet minister said: ""The right of the party never managed to completely subdue the unions, the left won't do it either."" They still pay the bills. The bitter fights about changes to this rule or that rule - and union resistance to them - are not about what happens to Jeremy Corbyn, but about what comes next. One senior figure told me: ""I'd rather gamble on the future leadership of the unions than on a huge bunch of activists."" Labour has changed, and changed dramatically, but some things stay the same. There is ""a shudder in the air"" - not about Mr Corbyn's leadership, Labour has made an uneasy peace with that - but about what remains when his days as leader are over. In volatile political times, of course, events, rather than Labour's own dilemmas, are likely to shape what happens. But beyond Liverpool this week, beyond the fringe, beyond the hall, there is a question being asked in Labour circles: is Jeremy Corbyn's leadership the start, or the end?"

What is Labour's Brexit policy, and what does it think should happen next?First of all, Labour says the government's Brexit proposals are failing to meet the six tests that Labour set out last year.Labour says these are the tests against which it will judge any final Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May's government, as part of the Article 50 negotiations on leaving the EU. They are: Labour has now published a report, which says all six of the tests are ""on course to be failed"".""Let me be very clear - right here, right now,"" Sir Keir told the BBC. ""If Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts.""But there are buts. When you look at the tests it is hardly surprising that they are on course to be failed, because of the way Labour set them out in the first place, as a way to judge the final Brexit deal. What is being negotiated between the UK and the EU now is the withdrawal agreement - the terms of divorce, rather than the precise detail of the future relationship. So it's not the final deal, and that makes some of the tests rather hard to assess fully at this stage. Take test number one: does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the EU? No-one can ensure that at the moment, and we probably won't know for sure until long after we've left. If a deal on a withdrawal agreement is done, it will be accompanied by a non-binding political declaration, which will presumably gush enthusiastically about a strong partnership in the future. Please upgrade your browserBoth sides want a strong partnership; they will remain neighbours. But the details will have to be negotiated later. A political declaration would set the tone and give some detail, but it could still lead to a blind Brexit: in other words, leaving without knowing our final destination.Take test number two: does a deal give the UK the ""exact same benefits"" as membership of the single market and the customs union? Well there's only really one way to achieve the ""exact same benefits"" and that's staying in the single market and the customs union, which is not official Labour policy. Labour says it wants to stay in ""a"" customs union, and stay as close to the single market as possible. That is not the same as membership, so you can argue that even current Labour policy would fail its own test. Labour is keen to emphasise that the six tests are based on promises and commitments the government made about what it would achieve in Brexit negotiations. So this process was certainly a way of holding the government to account. But the tests were also broad enough to cope with divisions within the Labour party about the best way forward. Now, though, the six tests have led to a decisive moment - barring unexpected developments, Labour will vote against a Brexit deal, increasing the chances that it will get rejected. Sir Keir says that's because the government has ""no credible plan"" for Brexit. But does the Labour party have one?Sir Keir confirmed that Labour wanted a general election if the government was defeated in a ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit, although Jeremy Corbyn later said he would also try to send the government back to Brussels to negotiate again.In other words, very little in Labour's Brexit strategy appears to be set in stone. The trouble with the idea of calling for another election is that it's not in Labour's gift. If Prime Minister Theresa May decided to call for an election, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act two-thirds of MPs would have to vote in favour (or go through a no-confidence procedure). And even if a snap election were to take place, it's not clear what would be in a Labour manifesto. Would it include explicit support for another referendum? Would it openly support staying in the single market, even on an interim basis?What we do know is that under the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act, the government would have 21 days to tell Parliament what it intended to do next if MPs rejected a Brexit deal in a ""meaningful vote"". Debates would have to take place in the House of Commons and the House of Lords within seven days. But what would be debated?These are obviously uncharted waters, and it may be up to the Speaker to decide whether any motions to be considered in parliament at that time could be amended, to allow, for example, for MPs to call for another referendum.The government's thinking on the Speaker's role is set out in this Written Ministerial Statement.Pushing for another referendum may well become Labour's main strategy, if it is unable to force an election. In his speech to conference, Sir Keir said the party had to be able to put forward alternatives to leaving the EU with no deal, including - crucially - campaigning for a public vote.   When the shadow Brexit secretary emphasised that nobody was ruling out Remain as an option in such a vote (a remark that was not in the text of the speech distributed to journalists) he received a standing ovation. But not everyone in the party was cheering.Groups like Labour Leave hold a very different view, arguing that ""throwing around the possibility of a second referendum is devastating to the party's brand"". And even within the shadow cabinet there are differences of opinion about the best Brexit strategy to pursue. Leaving the European Union involves big decisions about the way the country is run, bigger than this generation of politicians has faced before. So it is not surprising that the arguments within both Labour and the Conservatives go well beyond traditional party loyalties. But time is running very short for those decisions to be made.

Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK but talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan, which was the UK's official view of a proposed Brexit deal.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May held an awayday for the cabinet at her country residence - Chequers - in July. At this gathering a favoured UK position for Brexit talks was agreed. It included proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals and says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanFollowing the European Council President Donald Tusk's rejection of the Chequers plan after the EU's September gathering, there has been mounting speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. One of Mrs May's repeated phrases has been that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". A wide-range of documents setting out the probable state of play if the UK leaves the EU without a deal has been recently published by the government. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but a group of Tory MPs have endorsed a plan for a ""clean break"" with the EU.Reality Check: The case for a 'clean-break' BrexitBrexit papers: What no deal could meanPet travel warning in no-deal Brexit planBritain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

""When we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government. Investing in Britain after years of austerity and neglect and bringing our country together after a decade of division,"" he told delegates, to cheers.He told them ""the old way of running things isn't working anymore"" and Labour's better-than-expected election result last year showed voters were ready for something new.""Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.""But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.""People in this country know - they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn't working any more."" AnalysisThe Labour conference is more at ease with itself this year, and this speech was designed to show the rest of the country that that party has solid, credible, worked-out answers for the questions of the day.Scepticism about his programme still runs far and wide in the parliamentary party at Westminster.But this Liverpool gathering has more or less, despite tensions over the EU, shown that Labour has moved on from the turmoil when Mr Corbyn first took over.Party conferences are always a shop window for leaders to show their wares to the rest of the country.Read more from LauraLabour members voted on Tuesday to keep all options on the table - including a fresh referendum - if there is no Brexit deal with Brussels.Mr Corbyn said in his speech he would support Theresa May on Brexit - if she got a ""sensible"" deal that included a customs union that prevented the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland and protected workers' rights.He said Labour would vote against the PM's Chequers plan ""or whatever is left of it"" and oppose leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would be a ""national disaster"".But he told Mrs May: ""If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people's rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. ""A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.""But if you can't negotiate that deal then you need to make way for a party that can and will.""This call, delivered with venom by Mr Corbyn, went down well in the hall. Delegates gave their leader a standing ovation and there was an outbreak of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"".Mrs May has consistently ruled out a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader also used his speech to announce plans to create 400,000 skilled jobs with new investment in fresh wind farms and insulation for homes.He pointed to Labour's commitment to reduce the UK's net carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 - and to zero by 2050.Labour's energy plans would ""make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations"", said Mr Corbyn.And they would bring ""skills and security to communities held back for too long"", in all parts of the UK.Turning to the row over anti-Semitism in Labour, Mr Corbyn said it had caused ""immense hurt and anxiety"" and there was a standing ovation as he told Jewish people: ""We are your ally.""Being anti-racist was ""integral to our very being"", he went on, adding that he would not accept being accused of anti-Semitism by ""Tory hypocrites"", criticising the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and MEPs' ""support"" for the Hungarian government of Viktor Orban.On foreign policy, Mr Corbyn said evidence ""now points clearly to the Russian state"" as being responsible for the Salisbury poisoning and promised ""no more reckless wars of intervention"" like those in Iraq and Libya.And he condemned the actions of Israeli forces in Gaza, calling for a ""secure Israel and a viable and secure Palestinian state"".Labour would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it takes office, he said, ""in order to help make that two-state settlement a reality"".Earlier in his speech, to applause in the arena, he attacked parts of the British press, saying billionaire newspapers owners did not like Labour ""one little bit"".He called on supporters to challenge their ""propaganda of privilege"", using ""the mass media of the 21st century"" - social media.Freedom of the press must be protected, he said: ""But here, a free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful.""Mr Corbyn said Labour would put ""fairness and humanity"" back into public services, pointing to pledges to increase the number of police officers and expand free childcare.Labour has used its week in Liverpool to announce a string of new policies, building on those contained in its 2017 general election manifesto.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell unveiled plans to force large companies to give staff 1% of their shares a year, netting them up to Â£500 a year each.He also set out plans to ""democratise"" the economy by renationalising the water industry, which he said would hand power to workers, consumers and local councils. Further nationalisations - of the rail, mail and energy industries - would follow under a Labour government.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the speech showed Mr Corbyn ""was unfit to govern"" and would ""open the door to re-running the referendum"".The SNP said the Scottish government was already delivering on issues mentioned in the speech such as tough climate change targets, a publicly-owned bid to run Scotland's railways and free sanitary products in schools.And Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn must listen to his party members and support the campaign to stop Brexit. The CBI business group's director general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was ""much common ground between business and Labour"" but warned that ""continual public barbs and backward-facing policy are deterring entrepreneurs and investors, at a time when we need them most"".Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""That speech was inspiring. We heard a Labour leader draw a very clear line under the failed policies of the past, policies that have caused despair and division in our communities, and then set out a distinctive, different, positive Labour programme for the country.""The British Chambers of Commerce said there were some ""bright spots"" but ""Jeremy Corbyn missed a golden opportunity to extend an olive branch to British business""."

While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.

Boris Johnson has called her so-called Chequers plan ""deranged"".In his latest broadside against her Brexit strategy, the former foreign secretary suggested he might be able to strike a better deal than her with Brussels.He told the Sunday Times : ""Unlike the prime minister, I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it's the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016.""Mr Johnson also set out domestic policy ideas, including building a bridge between Britain and Ireland and putting the HS2 scheme on hold to focus on a rail link in northern England.Mrs May, who campaigned for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, hit back at Mr Johnson in her Andrew Marr interview.She said: ""I do believe in Brexit. Crucially, I believe in delivering Brexit in a way that respects the vote and delivers on the vote of the British people while also protecting our union, protecting jobs and ensuring we make a success of Brexit for the future.""That's why I want us to get a really good free trade deal with the European Union, which is what lies at the heart of the Chequers plan.""But she also said she was prepared for a ""no deal"" scenario, saying: ""We will make a success of Brexit, regardless of the outcome of the negotiations.""The Labour Party has said it will back Mrs May in Parliament if she agrees to their plan for a customs union with the EU and a Brexit deal that guarantees workers' rights and protects jobs.Mrs May said: ""My message to the Labour Party is that they should stop playing politics with Brexit and start acting in the national interest.""My message to my party is let's come together and get the best deal for Britain.""EU leaders have rejected her Chequers plan because they believe it would undermine the single market by allowing the UK to ""cherry pick"" bits of EU law it liked and ditch the rest.Mrs May said: ""We think we are putting forward a proposal that will maintain the integrity of the single market.""She said she wanted a more detailed response from the EU on their objections.Later on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt hit back at the EU's negotiation stance in his speech to the party conference.He said the EU seemed to want to ""punish"" the UK for leaving, and added: ""If you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out of it won't diminish, it will grow and we won't be the only prisoner that will want to escape.""Mr Hunt also addressed EU leaders directly, saying: ""If you reject the hand of friendship offered by our prime minister, you turn your back on the partnership that has given Europe more security, more freedom, more prosperity, more opportunities than ever before in history.""In the main conference hall, pro-Brexit former CBI chief Sir Digby Jones gave a watching Mrs May a boost with a speech hailing her for standing up to the EU ""bully boys"" and attacking Mr Johnson as an ""irrelevance"".By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent, in BirminghamJust like the Labour conference last week, the Conservatives are keen to show us they have plenty of songs on their playlist.But just like the Labour conference last week, one record is louder than all the others and seems jammed on repeat: Brexit.Autumn guarantees two things: leaves falling off trees and Conservative conferences in which there is a series of deftly choreographed Johnsonian interventions, before and during the main event. Forty-eight hours on from his 4,000 or so words for the Daily Telegraph, one word from Mr Johnson is sufficient to grab a headline or two today: ""deranged"". The big question of the next few days, beyond the Brexit noise: does the PM offer any indication, however vague, of the possibility of her shifting on her much criticised Brexit plan? But former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who like Mr Johnson quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit proposals, told Sky News the Chequers plan ""will die"" because ""it's just wrong"".He said he expected a free trade deal to be struck along the lines of a Canada-style agreement, adding that ""we are going to have a very scary few months"" as talks with the EU entered their final stages, but that was ""normal"".On the Andrew Marr Show, Mrs May also defended the ""hostile environment"" immigration policies she introduced as home secretary,  which led to people from the so-called Windrush generation losing their jobs, welfare benefits and right to remain in the UK.She apologised for the fact that many long-standing UK residents of Caribbean origin had been caught by her Immigration Act, but declined to apologise for the policy itself.Mrs May wants to use the Conservative conference to focus on domestic issues as well as Brexit, after Labour unveiled a string of new policies at its conference last week.She has announced plans to tackle a big increase in rough sleeping, to be funded by a tax on foreign-owned homes.The Prime Minister also revealed plans for a Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to showcase the nation in January 2022 - months before the next scheduled general election.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock said health officials would produce guidelines on the amount of time young people should spend on social media.Please upgrade your browser"
2018-09-30,Foreign buyers could face new housing tax,https://web.archive.org//web/20180930194934/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45698446,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowForeign property buyers will face an extra tax with the money raised being spent on tackling rough sleeping, Prime Minister Theresa May has said.She said foreign buyers could face a surcharge of 1% or 3% on top of stamp duty to stop them driving up UK prices.Rough sleeping has been rising for the past seven years that the Conservatives have been in government. Homelessness charity Shelter said the housing crisis will remain until more social housing is built. Stamp duty is a tax on properties worth more than Â£125,000.""The money we raise from this extra stamp duty is going to be spent on dealing with the issue of rough sleeping,"" Mrs May told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme. Mrs May said evidence showed that foreign buyers who do not pay tax in the UK push up house prices and lower home ownership in the UK. Rough sleeping is defined by the government as sleeping in the open air - parks, streets, doorways or bus shelters - or people who sleep in buildings that were not designed for habitation.About 4,750 people are estimated to have slept rough on any given night in England in 2017.Most councils provide an estimate based on intelligence from local services but some conduct a count of the number of people seen sleeping rough on a single night.""We've sadly seen roughly sleeping going up recently, which is why it is is important we are taking a number of actions,"" Mrs May said from Birmingham, where her party's annual conference has begun.""We've already put money in to projects to ensure that we are helping those who are sleeping rough, this will enable more money to be put in.""Mrs May highlighted projects such as the Housing First model, being piloted in the West Midlands, which sees rough sleepers given a home, rather than shelters.In August, the government announced a Â£100m strategy to tackle rough sleeping on English streets, but it was criticised as it became apparent no new money was being invested. The Conservatives say this policy would help British residents ""get the right home for them"" and ""end the scourge of rough sleeping for good"". It is unclear when the new rates would be introduced. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Conservatives were ""desperately trying to play catch up"" with a ""rehash"" of his party's proposals from Labour's 2017 manifesto. ""Unlike the Tories' proposal this weekend, Labour's fully costed offshore company property levy targeted the tax avoiders and those seeking to speculate on UK property markets,"" he added.While Shelter welcomed the proposed funding, it said it was ""a national disgrace that so many of our fellow citizens are still sleeping rough in modern Britain"".""We need to understand that the housing crisis will remain for as long as we fail to build more social homes to give people a secure and affordable way to live,"" the charity said. In 2016-17, about 217,000 new homes were built in England - almost a third short of the government's target of 300,000.Labour party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""The Tories are offering watered down, half-baked policies that don't begin to compare with Labour's radical plan to rebuild Britain after years of austerity.""Under proposals announced last week, Labour said if it was in government it would introduce a new levy on second homes that are used as holiday homes, ban letting agent fees and scrap laws allowing private landlords to evict tenants without giving a reason.

As Tory activists assembled in Birmingham for their party conference, she said: ""There's been time over the last two years for debate.""The former foreign secretary was in one of the great offices of state during the time that much of this plan was being constructed - and praised it as soon ago as November of last year.""Now is the time for Conservatives to get behind the prime minister, give her the space to get the deal done and to back her to deliver for the country.""In terms of a period of silence, I would be very welcoming of one.""Her comments followed another strident intervention in the Brexit debate by the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.He told the Sunday Times: ""Unlike the prime minister, I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it's the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016.""Theresa May later insisted she did believe in Brexit, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that the Chequers plan had the ability to deliver a good free trade deal with the European Union. Ms Davidson also said she would go into the next election with a manifesto commitment to block a second Scottish independence referendum because in 2014 ""the people of Scotland were promised this would be a once in a generation event"".Asked about calls for another referendum on any Brexit deal, she said: ""In terms of our history in Scotland, I've been pretty vocal about the fact that you can't re-run referendums if you are a nationalist because you didn't get the result you want.""I'd be pretty hypocritical if I said you could re-run this Brexit referendum because it wasn't the result the I argued for."""

She shared a redacted picture of Mr Johnson's profile, which did not reveal his phone number.It appears that people could access an MP's personal details by entering their email address, without a password, when pressing the attendee's button in the app. This button has since been removed on the app, which was created by Australian firm Crowd Comms.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the app was ""now functioning securely"" and the party would be ""investigating the issue further"".On Thursday the Evening Standard reported Mr Lewis was set to ""unveil the first 'interactive' conference app"" on Sunday in a bid to overhaul the Conservatives image, and appealing to the younger voter.Theresa May arrives at #CPC18 in Birmingham - faced with shouts of âhave you checked out the conference app?â ... the Tories will want a glitch free few days - this data breach is not a good start pic.twitter.com/KLdF37HrtfEnd of Twitter post  by @robpowellnewsPrime Minister Theresa May, who was arriving at the conference in Birmingham, ignored questions from reporters about the security blunder.The Press Association said the details of Environment Secretary Michael Gove had also been shared online. By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent, in BirminghamOn the very day Business Secretary Greg Clark expressed concern about Facebook's security breach, the Conservative Party has had to say sorry for its own.This conference hasn't even started yet, but officials are already rattled.One Conservative source described it to me in very colourful, unbroadcastable terms, in a text message he sent me by accident.Was this a breach of national security? No. Was it an unforced error the party could do without, and a bumpy start to what was already likely to be a bumpy conference? Yes.And this may well not be the end of it, with the Information Commissioner's Office now involved.Pictures on Twitter show people apparently changing individuals' profile pictures and leaving messages on the app's internal messaging system.One Twitter user posted a snapshot of Mr Gove's profile picture, which had been changed to a snap of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.Mr Gove previously worked as a journalist at The Times, one of Mr Murdoch's papers. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it would be making inquiries about the breach and added that ""organisations have a legal duty to keep personal data safe and secure"". The ICO's statement added under the EU's new GDPR regulation, the Conservative Party has 72 hours to notify the regulator of a personal data breach that ""could pose a risk to people's rights and freedoms"".One of Labour's shadow cabinet, Jon Trickett, criticised the Conservatives for the breach and said: ""How can we trust this Tory government with our country's security when they can't even build a conference app that keeps the data of their members, MPs and others attending safe?""Labour's grassroots campaign group Momentum said their party's app had been developed by a team of volunteers, adding: ""I'm sure they'd be happy to give the Tories a few tips next year.""The Conservative Party conference is being held in Birmingham and is due to start on Sunday.

2018-09-30,UK would 'forever regret' losing carmakers,https://web.archive.org//web/20180930194934/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45693341,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK ""would regret it forever"" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.He added it was ""concerning"" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby. ""We need a deal,"" Mr Clark said.The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs. The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.""My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory,"" said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston. Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Toyota's production line is run on a ""just-in-time"" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped. Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is ""precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border"". ""We need to have a deal... we want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.""Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs. Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: ""In my experience once these jobs go they never come back. ""And that's why we have to do everything possible to keep these jobs in the area.""A government spokesperson said: ""We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU. ""As part of this we have proposed a UK-EU free trade area underpinned by a common rulebook on manufactured goods, such as automotives.""Started production December 1992 Employs 2,564 (inc 322 agency) Produces Auris and Avensis - including pressing body panels, welding and assemblySite is 580 acres - 2.35 million square metresTotal vehicles produced: 144,077, of which Avensis: 25,057, Auris: 34,899 and Auris Hybrid: 84,121"
2018-09-30,Tory MP Heidi Allen backs new Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20180930194934/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45690898,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA Conservative MP says she sees no alternative other than backing another referendum on leaving the EU. Heidi Allen becomes the latest Tory to support a new vote, saying the ""right-wing"" of her party had made Theresa May's Chequers Brexit plan - ""dead"".""They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands,"" she told the BBC.The prime minister has ruled out a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.Mrs May's Chequers plan - which would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in trade in goods - has been heavily criticised by Tory Brexiteers, including Boris Johnson. Ms Allen - who campaigned to Remain in the EU in 2016 - told Radio 4's Today programme that while she would still support in principle an ""11th hour"" deal from Mrs May and the EU, ""too many"" of her party - especially those on the right - would not. The South Cambridgeshire MP said she had been left with ""no alternative other than asking - should we come to that, no deal, that looks like that's what's going to happen - then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next."" On what a further referendum could look like, Ms Allen suggested that it should include the option of staying in the EU under existing terms.By Jessica Parker, political correspondentHeidi Allen joins a handful of Tory backbenchers who've openly said a so-called people's vote may now be needed. And as someone who supported Remain, her comments may come as no surprise. But, perhaps more significantly, she is the latest person to suggest that Theresa May's Chequers plan is dead. The blueprint, for our future relationship with the EU, has never been liked by the Leave supporting contingent. But people like Heidi Allen had previously said that they would at least give Chequers a chance. No more. It comes as Labour - not to mention the EU - has also declared that the proposals are unworkable in their current form. And while Number 10 is sticking to its guns, there must be a big question as to how long this situation can be sustained.The People's Vote campaign group wants to give the public the final say over whether the UK leaves the EU, arguing that voters should be given a choice  between leaving with or without a deal or staying on current terms.Anna Soubry, Justine Greening and Sarah Wollaston are among the Conservative MPs who have supported a further referendum. Ms Allen's comments come after ex-PM Sir John Major also made the case for another Brexit vote and highlighted the ""completely unacceptable"" attacks by certain Tory MPs on Mrs May. Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson set out his ""better Brexit plan"" and refused to rule out a leadership challenge.Last week Labour members voted to keep the option of another referendum on the table if parliament is deadlocked over the final outcome the government's Brexit negotiations.The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations on the terms of exit and future co-operation are continuing.The Conservative party is gathering in Birmingham for its annual conference.

The former shadow chancellor is the latest of a number of vocal critics of party leader Jeremy Corbyn to face such votes.The result carries no official weight but recent changes to party rules make it easier to remove sitting MPs.Mr Leslie and supporters boycotted the meeting, saying he had been unfairly targeted.Mr Leslie has represented the constituency since 2010. He stepped down as shadow chancellor when Jeremy Corbyn won the leadership.Louise Regan, chair of the Nottingham East Labour Party, said: ""We have overwhelmingly passed a vote of no confidence in Chris Leslie the MP.""But actually our biggest focus is to go out tomorrow campaigning because what we want is to elect a Labour government.""Mr Leslie said: ""Sadly differing opinions are no longer tolerated in some parts of the Labour Party.""But I have to weigh the views of a few dozen people at this meeting with the thousands who voted for me at the last election."" Others to face no confidence votes from their local parties are Luton South MP Gavin Shuker, Joan Ryan, MP for Enfield North, and Frank Field who quit the parliamentary party earlier this month.Such votes carry no official force within the Labour Party but local activists could hold a ""trigger ballot"", where sitting Labour MPs can be forced to compete for selection as a candidate against all-comers, ahead of the next general election."

Earlier this month Conservative MPs opposed to the PM's plan met to discuss how and when they could force her to stand down.Speaking at an event in South Shields alongside the former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, Sir John said: ""I do not think routine attacks on the PM in the most lurid fashion is either the spirit of politics that one would wish to see, or is it in the interest of the negotiating posture of the United Kingdom.""He did not mention any MP by name, but said: ""When I look at the alternatives to the prime minister I am drawn even more closely to her.""He added that ""the threats that come in her direction of a leadership election unless she delivers a certain sort of Brexit... [went] far beyond anything that I would think was remotely acceptable in behaviour towards any prime minister"".And he underlined the ""inability of those who level these taunts to actually come up with any coherent plan of any sort themselves"". In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Friday, Mr Johnson repeatedly refused to rule out challenging Mrs May for the Tory leadership, instead saying, ""My job is to speak up for what I believe in"".Mrs May would stay in office ""as long as she feels it necessary"", he added. He also restated his opposition to Mrs May's Chequers plan, warning it would be ""a political and economic disaster"" for the country.Elsewhere, Sir John reiterated his belief that the UK public should be allowed to vote again on leaving the EU - because the argument made in favour of Brexit at the 2016 referendum had been ""a fantasy"".""Almost nothing that was said has turned out to be the case,"" he said.The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations on the terms of exit and future co-operation are continuing. The Conservative Party conference is due to start in Birmingham."

A government source said Mr Johnson was ""regurgitating ideas"", not coming up with any new answers.Mr Johnson quit the cabinet in July in protest at Mrs May's plan for future economic co-operation with the EU, which he says will curb the UK's sovereignty and betray the 2016 referendum vote. His latest attack on Mrs May's policy, which would see the UK sign up to a common rule book for trade in goods, comes two days before the start of the Conservative Party conference.In an article for the Daily Telegraph on Friday, Mr Johnson claimed the Chequers plan was ""a moral and intellectual humiliation"" for the UK and it was not too late for Mrs May to back a ""super Canada"" deal, which is favoured by many Tory Brexiteers. Speaking to the BBC's political editor, in his first interview since quitting the cabinet, he rejected suggestions he was simply trying to make life difficult for the prime minister, describing Theresa May as a ""remarkable person"". ""As she said to us herself and she said to the country...she will go for as long as she feels it necessary.""He urged Mrs May to ""get back"" to the principles he said she had initially set out in Brexit negotiations before, in his words, being ""blown off course"" by the 2017 general election. Asked to rule out a leadership challenge if this did not happen, he replied: ""My job is to speak up for what I believe in and the vision that I've set out today and I believe in it very very sincerely.""I'm going to keep going for as long as it takes.""He added: ""The most important thing for me is to avert what I think would be a political and economic disaster for this country. To come out of the EU but still to be run by the EU - what is the point of that?"" By BBC Political Editor Laura KuenssbergIt is no secret that he still wants and believes he has a shot at Number 10.And having turned down interviews for several months after his departure from government, speaking out today on the eve of the Conservative conference outwardly appears designed to stir as much trouble as possible.Mr Johnson is adamant, of course, that what he is really involved in is trying to change Number 10's policy, rather than trying to shove Theresa May out.Read Laura's blogThe Chequers plan was ""unacceptable"" to the British public, he said, and it was ""pie in the sky"" to suggest, as some have done, that it could be modified after the UK's exit from the EU on 29 March, 2019. ""It will do lasting damage to the credibility of this country around the world. People will say the UK is a greater power, a great economy. Why are they so passive and so supine as to remain in the orbit of Brussels.""Asked whether he was prepared to actually vote down a deal based on Chequers if it came to it in Parliament, and potentially see the UK leaving without a deal, he said: ""You will have to see.""But he added: ""At the moment, I cannot see how I can support Chequers, I have to be honest.""In response, a government source said: ""Boris was a member of the Cabinet that agreed the December Joint Report and praised the PM for doing so.""The truth is that reneging on those things would simply guarantee no deal.""And Tory MP Sir Alan Duncan - a junior minister in Mr Johnson's old department - said his former boss was addicted to media attention.""Publicity is his cocaine. He needs a regular fix,"" the foreign office minister told The Spectator. But, he added, Mr Johnson's power as an ""electoral asset"" was ""now waning"".The UK and EU are seeking to negotiate the terms of exit, as well as an outline agreement on future cooperation by the middle of November at the latest. But the European Parliament's representative in Brexit talks warned the UK it will not approve a relationship with the UK where EU nationals were discriminated against by nationality or type of job.Referring to the cabinet's recent decision that EU nationals would not be privileged in the UK's new immigration regime, Guy Verhoftsadt said the system for EU citizens coming to the UK after Brexit would likely be reciprocated for British citizens moving in the other direction. Meanwhile, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has ruled out standing as a candidate to become the next head of the European Commission, saying he was committed to seeing the talks through ""right to the end"".

At this week's party conference, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told delegates he wanted the party and the Jewish community to ""work together and draw a line"" under the anti-Semitism row.Indeed, relations have been strained for some time, with an inquiry into anti-Semitism in the party launched in 2016. Last month Labour adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism, although critics said the addition of a ""caveat"" undermined the international definition. Now, a study of results at the 2017 general election suggests some damage may already have been done before the row intensified this summer. It appears Labour may have underperformed in the constituencies with the most Jewish people.Across the UK, there are five constituencies where, according to the 2011 Census (the most recent), more than 10% of the population identify as Jewish.Four of them are in or just outside north London - Finchley and Golders Green, Hendon, Hertsmere, and Hackney North and Stoke Newington, where the local MP is shadow home secretary Diane Abbott. The fifth is Bury South, just outside Manchester.In these seats, Labour's share of the vote at the 2017 general election increased by seven points when compared with the 2015 election.However, this was nearly three points below the 9.8 point overall increase the party saw across the country. This underperformance appears to be greater still if we look at how constituencies voted in the 2016 EU referendum. In most cases, the higher the Remain vote was, the better Labour did in the election that followed.Once we take this into account, Labour's share of the vote in the constituencies with the most Jewish voters appears to be about 4.5 points below what might have been expected.In two constituencies, Finchley and Golders Green, and Hendon, this is greater than the margin by which it was beaten.Of course, we cannot be certain that the party's apparent difficulties in these seats was the result of its failure to win the support of Jewish voters. Labour might have had difficulties winning over the many other voters in these areas. Rival candidates may have fought a particularly good campaign.But it would be quite a coincidence if it had these problems in every seat with a large Jewish population.It is a problem that continued at local elections earlier this year, when the party failed to win Barnet (which incorporates Finchley and Golders Green), despite performing strongly elsewhere in the capital. Its failure prompted a senior Labour politician to say he ""suspects"" the anti-Semitism row was to blame.Despite these problems, Labour has found greater success with a different group of voters.Jeremy Corbyn has long campaigned against Islamophobia and his staunch opposition to the Iraq War is well documented. So, we might ask whether the Labour leader's record on such issues has enhanced support among Muslim voters.Certainly, the relationship was strained under Tony Blair, following his decision to join the US-led invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. The party lost ground heavily in 2005 in constituencies with large Muslim communities. Although much of that ground had been recovered by the 2015 general election, Labour did especially well in areas with large Muslim populations in 2017.There are 78 constituencies where more than 10% of people identify as Muslim, according to the 2011 Census.In these seats, Labour's vote increased by an average of 11.8 points - a couple of points better than its performance across the country as a whole.However, these were also seats where support for Remain was higher than in the UK overall - by about five points on average. But even when we take this into account, Labour's vote increased in these areas by just under a point more than we would otherwise have expected.More like thisThe difference this will have made to Labour's election performance is limited by the reality that most constituencies with a relatively large Muslim population are already safe Labour seats. Such a small advantage will have simply bolstered the party's already strong position locally. At most, there are a couple of seats, Keighley and Kensington, where Labour won only very narrowly and where any additional support from Muslims in these areas could conceivably have been decisive.However, in neither case can we say that this is what happened.About this pieceThis analysis piece is based on an extract of The British General Election of 2017 by Philip Cowley and Dennis Kavanagh.

The paper clarified that this meant electricity and heating, so not transport.The first thing to say is that the plan to achieve this by 2030 assumes that there will be a Labour government in place early next year.Capacity from solar power would be increased to 35,000MW, onshore wind to 30,000MW and offshore wind to 52,000MW. You can see from the chart above that those would be big increases, but Labour has given itself 12 years to achieve them.Let's start with solar power. The plan is a bit confusing because it says that the UK's solar capacity would be almost tripled to 35,000MW by 2030 ""with a combination of large and small-scale installations, installing solar PV [panels] on all viable UK roofs"".A viable roof is effectively any one that is structurally sound so that it can support the panels and facing any direction other than north, according to the industry.The Solar Trade Association told BBC Reality Check that the 35,000MW capacity from rooftop solar panels by 2030 could be achieved relatively easily, but that it would not require all viable roofs to have panels.You can see from the chart above that the rate at which new generating capacity was being installed, slowed after the government cut subsidies to households installing solar panels at the end of 2015. But the industry says that a big resource available to be exploited is the roofs of commercial and industrial properties.The plan for onshore wind involves having 6,000 more turbines by 2030. There are currently 7,638 onshore turbines either operational or under construction, so the number would be almost doubled.Offshore wind plans would involve adding 7,500 turbines to the existing 2,296 either operational or under construction, so that would more than quadruple the number of offshore turbines.The party plans to meet the demand for all the necessary ""turbine components, high voltage cables and the large supply chain of goods required, from lifting gear to electric control equipment"" through UK manufacturing.The industry body Renewable UK says that currently 48% of spending on planning, building and running UK offshore wind projects goes to firms in the UK.Examples include MHI Vestas Offshore Wind, which makes 80m-long blades on the Isle of Wight, Siemens Gamesa manufacturing blades and assembling offshore turbines in Hull and JDR Cables in Hartlepool, which supplies subsea cabling for offshore wind farms.BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh points out: ""It is unclear whether engineering companies are able to make parts for and construct turbines at the rate Mr Corbyn has promised."" The plans to make homes cheaper to heat and more energy efficient are the only part to which money has been allocated so far. Labour has set aside Â£12.8bn in its National Transformation Fund to cover the insulation programme in its first term, which will pay for the work to be done free for the homes of lower income owner-occupiers and those in social housing as well as zero interest loans to help those who are able to pay for the work.But as Pallab Ghosh points out: ""Successive governments have failed to persuade enough people to insulate their homes, even if it is for free.""What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-09-30,Laura Kuenssberg,https://web.archive.org//web/20180930194934/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45661781,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA few days before this Labour conference, one of Jeremy Corbyn's close allies suggested to me this would be the week that would demonstrate if Mr Corbyn has really transformed the Labour Party.Whether he meant the promises he made to his supporters when vowing to bring in a genuinely ""new kind of politics"".Well, Jeremy Corbyn has changed. His son Ben told us today, after his father's speech, that he was ""smoother"" now, and, excitedly, he claimed: ""There was a new centre emerging."" And yes, Labour has changed. Looking out on to the crowds chanting his name, their leader could be sure that hall, that audience, is behind him. After three years of angst, with some MPs trying to remove him, Mr Corbyn - or his team - have almost total control over his party and its mechanisms. MPs who were part of his early core of loyalists are understandably emboldened. MPs who despair of the leadership are mainly subdued, resigned to ""waiting it out"", as one described it.After the general election last year - and given the profound uncertainty in our politics right now - dissenters are unsure if their warnings that he could never win power were totally, and utterly, wrong. The bitterness between the two sides is still there, but the urgency has disappeared. As one insider described it, ""when you fight all the time, it's just exhausting"". To an extent, those Labour people who battled Corbyn and his enthusiastic supporters are simply too tired of it right now to carry on. But hold on a minute - not everything has gone according to the script. The rule changes that would make it easier for activists to change MPs, easier for members to have a say over policy, easier for members to influence the party's direction, did not sweep through without obstacle. And in setting policy through the National Policy Forum - a formal process - or trying to influence Labour in local government, or changing the selection rules, the changes that were meant to add up to a wholesale transformation of the party have not gone as far as originally intended. That's partly because when you scratch beneath the surface, there's a profound debate happening in all parts of the Labour Party about what comes next. Sure, in the immediate future, they are hopeful that a general election could emerge out of some chaotic post-Brexit vote, that could see them ride into power. But whatever the short term brings, with all its unpredictable scenarios, there is also a conversation about the long term. Some senior figures genuinely believe that the changes that have been wrought so far are just the beginning. The future for Labour, they argue, is in a mass movement where members have the control. In the optimistic version of this, Labour could build an entirely new model for British politics, with Jeremy Corbyn as the symbol for that new style, where members of the public who choose to join the party have their say. The darker scenario that could emerge, some MPs fear, is that rather than spending their time challenging their opponents in Westminster, scrutinising policy and representing all their constituents, they are consumed by a semi-permanent campaign to keep local activists happy - in order to keep their jobs. It's easier to argue for greater accountability and greater democracy, but those cautious about the idea argue it's just plain naÃ¯ve to imagine that those changes would not have a profound and negative impact on the job MPs do in Parliament. And there are frustrations on both sides. Plenty of people, whether in the Parliamentary party or in the unions, or in Momentum, or local party level, are finding individual frustrations. It's worth noting that the unions have been a big part of the block on some of the more sweeping changes that Jeremy Corbyn's supporters wanted.Yes, he has had crucial backing from those big voices in order to keep his job in the last few years - particularly vital still is the voice of Len McCluskey - but the unions have, no doubt, applied the brakes on some of the things that could have happened. Precisely in the same way they tried to do in previous times. As one shadow cabinet minister said: ""The right of the party never managed to completely subdue the unions, the left won't do it either."" They still pay the bills. The bitter fights about changes to this rule or that rule - and union resistance to them - are not about what happens to Jeremy Corbyn, but about what comes next. One senior figure told me: ""I'd rather gamble on the future leadership of the unions than on a huge bunch of activists."" Labour has changed, and changed dramatically, but some things stay the same. There is ""a shudder in the air"" - not about Mr Corbyn's leadership, Labour has made an uneasy peace with that - but about what remains when his days as leader are over. In volatile political times, of course, events, rather than Labour's own dilemmas, are likely to shape what happens. But beyond Liverpool this week, beyond the fringe, beyond the hall, there is a question being asked in Labour circles: is Jeremy Corbyn's leadership the start, or the end?"

What is Labour's Brexit policy, and what does it think should happen next?First of all, Labour says the government's Brexit proposals are failing to meet the six tests that Labour set out last year.Labour says these are the tests against which it will judge any final Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May's government, as part of the Article 50 negotiations on leaving the EU. They are: Labour has now published a report, which says all six of the tests are ""on course to be failed"".""Let me be very clear - right here, right now,"" Sir Keir told the BBC. ""If Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts.""But there are buts. When you look at the tests it is hardly surprising that they are on course to be failed, because of the way Labour set them out in the first place, as a way to judge the final Brexit deal. What is being negotiated between the UK and the EU now is the withdrawal agreement - the terms of divorce, rather than the precise detail of the future relationship. So it's not the final deal, and that makes some of the tests rather hard to assess fully at this stage. Take test number one: does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with the EU? No-one can ensure that at the moment, and we probably won't know for sure until long after we've left. If a deal on a withdrawal agreement is done, it will be accompanied by a non-binding political declaration, which will presumably gush enthusiastically about a strong partnership in the future. Please upgrade your browserBoth sides want a strong partnership; they will remain neighbours. But the details will have to be negotiated later. A political declaration would set the tone and give some detail, but it could still lead to a blind Brexit: in other words, leaving without knowing our final destination.Take test number two: does a deal give the UK the ""exact same benefits"" as membership of the single market and the customs union? Well there's only really one way to achieve the ""exact same benefits"" and that's staying in the single market and the customs union, which is not official Labour policy. Labour says it wants to stay in ""a"" customs union, and stay as close to the single market as possible. That is not the same as membership, so you can argue that even current Labour policy would fail its own test. Labour is keen to emphasise that the six tests are based on promises and commitments the government made about what it would achieve in Brexit negotiations. So this process was certainly a way of holding the government to account. But the tests were also broad enough to cope with divisions within the Labour party about the best way forward. Now, though, the six tests have led to a decisive moment - barring unexpected developments, Labour will vote against a Brexit deal, increasing the chances that it will get rejected. Sir Keir says that's because the government has ""no credible plan"" for Brexit. But does the Labour party have one?Sir Keir confirmed that Labour wanted a general election if the government was defeated in a ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit, although Jeremy Corbyn later said he would also try to send the government back to Brussels to negotiate again.In other words, very little in Labour's Brexit strategy appears to be set in stone. The trouble with the idea of calling for another election is that it's not in Labour's gift. If Prime Minister Theresa May decided to call for an election, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act two-thirds of MPs would have to vote in favour (or go through a no-confidence procedure). And even if a snap election were to take place, it's not clear what would be in a Labour manifesto. Would it include explicit support for another referendum? Would it openly support staying in the single market, even on an interim basis?What we do know is that under the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act, the government would have 21 days to tell Parliament what it intended to do next if MPs rejected a Brexit deal in a ""meaningful vote"". Debates would have to take place in the House of Commons and the House of Lords within seven days. But what would be debated?These are obviously uncharted waters, and it may be up to the Speaker to decide whether any motions to be considered in parliament at that time could be amended, to allow, for example, for MPs to call for another referendum.The government's thinking on the Speaker's role is set out in this Written Ministerial Statement.Pushing for another referendum may well become Labour's main strategy, if it is unable to force an election. In his speech to conference, Sir Keir said the party had to be able to put forward alternatives to leaving the EU with no deal, including - crucially - campaigning for a public vote.   When the shadow Brexit secretary emphasised that nobody was ruling out Remain as an option in such a vote (a remark that was not in the text of the speech distributed to journalists) he received a standing ovation. But not everyone in the party was cheering.Groups like Labour Leave hold a very different view, arguing that ""throwing around the possibility of a second referendum is devastating to the party's brand"". And even within the shadow cabinet there are differences of opinion about the best Brexit strategy to pursue. Leaving the European Union involves big decisions about the way the country is run, bigger than this generation of politicians has faced before. So it is not surprising that the arguments within both Labour and the Conservatives go well beyond traditional party loyalties. But time is running very short for those decisions to be made.

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK but talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan, which was the UK's official view of a proposed Brexit deal.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May held an awayday for the cabinet at her country residence - Chequers - in July. At this gathering a favoured UK position for Brexit talks was agreed. It included proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals and says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanFollowing the European Council President Donald Tusk's rejection of the Chequers plan after the EU's September gathering, there has been mounting speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. One of Mrs May's repeated phrases has been that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". A wide-range of documents setting out the probable state of play if the UK leaves the EU without a deal has been recently published by the government. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but a group of Tory MPs have endorsed a plan for a ""clean break"" with the EU.Reality Check: The case for a 'clean-break' BrexitBrexit papers: What no deal could meanPet travel warning in no-deal Brexit planBritain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about Â£72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is Â£39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to Â£4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was Â£8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was Â£5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs Â£4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (Â£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (Â£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of Â£10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was Â£350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned Â£20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

""When we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government. Investing in Britain after years of austerity and neglect and bringing our country together after a decade of division,"" he told delegates, to cheers.He told them ""the old way of running things isn't working anymore"" and Labour's better-than-expected election result last year showed voters were ready for something new.""Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.""But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.""People in this country know - they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn't working any more."" AnalysisThe Labour conference is more at ease with itself this year, and this speech was designed to show the rest of the country that that party has solid, credible, worked-out answers for the questions of the day.Scepticism about his programme still runs far and wide in the parliamentary party at Westminster.But this Liverpool gathering has more or less, despite tensions over the EU, shown that Labour has moved on from the turmoil when Mr Corbyn first took over.Party conferences are always a shop window for leaders to show their wares to the rest of the country.Read more from LauraLabour members voted on Tuesday to keep all options on the table - including a fresh referendum - if there is no Brexit deal with Brussels.Mr Corbyn said in his speech he would support Theresa May on Brexit - if she got a ""sensible"" deal that included a customs union that prevented the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland and protected workers' rights.He said Labour would vote against the PM's Chequers plan ""or whatever is left of it"" and oppose leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would be a ""national disaster"".But he told Mrs May: ""If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people's rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. ""A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.""But if you can't negotiate that deal then you need to make way for a party that can and will.""This call, delivered with venom by Mr Corbyn, went down well in the hall. Delegates gave their leader a standing ovation and there was an outbreak of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"".Mrs May has consistently ruled out a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader also used his speech to announce plans to create 400,000 skilled jobs with new investment in fresh wind farms and insulation for homes.He pointed to Labour's commitment to reduce the UK's net carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 - and to zero by 2050.Labour's energy plans would ""make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations"", said Mr Corbyn.And they would bring ""skills and security to communities held back for too long"", in all parts of the UK.Turning to the row over anti-Semitism in Labour, Mr Corbyn said it had caused ""immense hurt and anxiety"" and there was a standing ovation as he told Jewish people: ""We are your ally.""Being anti-racist was ""integral to our very being"", he went on, adding that he would not accept being accused of anti-Semitism by ""Tory hypocrites"", criticising the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and MEPs' ""support"" for the Hungarian government of Viktor Orban.On foreign policy, Mr Corbyn said evidence ""now points clearly to the Russian state"" as being responsible for the Salisbury poisoning and promised ""no more reckless wars of intervention"" like those in Iraq and Libya.And he condemned the actions of Israeli forces in Gaza, calling for a ""secure Israel and a viable and secure Palestinian state"".Labour would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it takes office, he said, ""in order to help make that two-state settlement a reality"".Earlier in his speech, to applause in the arena, he attacked parts of the British press, saying billionaire newspapers owners did not like Labour ""one little bit"".He called on supporters to challenge their ""propaganda of privilege"", using ""the mass media of the 21st century"" - social media.Freedom of the press must be protected, he said: ""But here, a free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful.""Mr Corbyn said Labour would put ""fairness and humanity"" back into public services, pointing to pledges to increase the number of police officers and expand free childcare.Labour has used its week in Liverpool to announce a string of new policies, building on those contained in its 2017 general election manifesto.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell unveiled plans to force large companies to give staff 1% of their shares a year, netting them up to Â£500 a year each.He also set out plans to ""democratise"" the economy by renationalising the water industry, which he said would hand power to workers, consumers and local councils. Further nationalisations - of the rail, mail and energy industries - would follow under a Labour government.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the speech showed Mr Corbyn ""was unfit to govern"" and would ""open the door to re-running the referendum"".The SNP said the Scottish government was already delivering on issues mentioned in the speech such as tough climate change targets, a publicly-owned bid to run Scotland's railways and free sanitary products in schools.And Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn must listen to his party members and support the campaign to stop Brexit. The CBI business group's director general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was ""much common ground between business and Labour"" but warned that ""continual public barbs and backward-facing policy are deterring entrepreneurs and investors, at a time when we need them most"".Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""That speech was inspiring. We heard a Labour leader draw a very clear line under the failed policies of the past, policies that have caused despair and division in our communities, and then set out a distinctive, different, positive Labour programme for the country.""The British Chambers of Commerce said there were some ""bright spots"" but ""Jeremy Corbyn missed a golden opportunity to extend an olive branch to British business""."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

The Scottish Tories have more than doubled their returns in some places where the party was previously unelectable. Read more from PhilipSee more images from the night here"
