2018-07-01,'Livid' Gove rips up EU customs report,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44668572,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove physically ripped up a report on Theresa May's preferred option for a new customs partnership with the EU.He was said to have been ""livid"" as he felt the government document downplayed his objections to the proposal.It comes amid cabinet splits over the future shape of Brexit, which Mrs May hopes to resolve on Friday.European Council president Donald Tusk has said the UK must agree its position and ""lay its cards on the table"".The government has talked publicly about two potential options for its customs relationship with the European Union after Brexit.One, a customs partnership, would mean the UK applies the EU's own tariffs and rules of origin to all goods arriving in the country, intended for the EU.The other, known as maximum facilitation or max-fac, aims to employ new technology to remove the need for physical customs checks where possible.Two groups of cabinet members were looking at each of the plans.The document in question, prepared by civil servants, was supposed to represent the views of a group of cabinet members looking at the customs partnership, including Mr Gove.The Sun reported Mr Gove ""physically ripped it up to show he wasn't prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions"".BBC political correspondent Matt Cole said representatives for Mr Gove had confirmed the paper's claims.Mr Gove was unhappy because it didn't ""reflect his views that a customs partnership would be too bureaucratic and make it harder for Britain to do business"", our correspondent said.By Matt Cole, BBC political correspondent This outburst of anger - and, crucially, the fact it has become public - is another sign that Cabinet discipline has broken down.The question around Westminster is has Theresa May lost control and, if so, is that irrevocable?In recent days Boris Johnson has been criticised by colleagues like Greg Clark and Matthew Hancock for using an expletive to summarise his views about business and Brexit.That was followed by another Cabinet member Liz Truss saying it ""wasn't macho"" for people like the defence secretary to publicly demand extra cash.This stuff is normally hidden behind the cloak of collective cabinet responsibility.So, with Michael Gove now happy for it to be known he's ""livid"" about a report by a sub-committee of a sub-committee (yes, that's right), it's only adding to the sense that the prime minister is a ring master whose whip crack is being ignored.It came as Mrs May attended an important summit at which Mr Tusk issued a ""last call"" to the UK to agree its position if a Brexit deal is to be done in time.Mr Tusk said the most difficult issues remained unresolved and quick progress was needed if agreement was to be reached by October.Mrs May and her cabinet are due to meet at Chequers next Friday as they look to agree on a blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU.The UK will then publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"", the prime minister has said.Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said Mr Gove's ""temper tantrum"" showed ""deep divides within the cabinet"" and the ""petulance of Brexiteers who can sense their lies are being exposed"".He said the cabinet ""need to act less like toddlers and more like senior ministers negotiating one of the most important deals in UK history""."
2018-07-01,Longer tenancies for renters proposed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44671094,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA minimum tenancy term of three years would be introduced under government proposals to give people renting homes in England more security.Figures show 80% of tenants currently have contracts of six or 12 months and ministers say longer agreements would allow them to put down more roots. They add tenants would be able to leave earlier under the plans while landlords would get more financial security.  Labour says the plans do not go far enough and rent rises should be capped. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said loss of tenancy was ""the main driver of homelessness"" and called for the government to ""go beyond three years"".A consultation on the minimum tenancy term will run until the end of the August.Exemptions to the rules could apply to some types of tenant - for instance those in student accommodation.Government figures show renters do stay in a property for an average of four years but most have shorter contracts.George Robertson, a landlord from St Albans, is concerned about how the proposals will affect him. ""I am a landlord with one house used as a pension top-up after my wife's state pension age was hiked up at short notice,"" he said.  ""We feel this proposal will force small landlords like us, with just one property, out of the market [and] it will make it so much harder to manage difficulties with problem tenants. ""If this becomes law I will sell my property as we couldn't face the hassle of dealing with possible issues."" Jonathan Pearson, a renter living in London, is worried the proposals will mean less flexibility for tenants.""If in future I say I only plan on renting for less than three years, that would reduce my chances of securing a property,"" said Mr Pearson.He said the real problem was the ""attitude of estate agents"", who treat tenants as a ""commodity"" and ""charge ridiculous tenancy renewal fees after the 12 month period is up"".But Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said it was an important step forward for tenants. He added: ""It is deeply unfair when renters are forced to uproot their lives or find new schools for their children at short notice due to the terms of their rental contract.""Being able to call your rental property your home is vital to putting down roots and building stronger communities.""By BBC business correspondent Joe LynamSomething significant has happened to home ownership in the UK - it's dropped from 72% a decade ago to 63% last year. Much of that is down to affordability - especially in the south east of England, bank reticence to lend and stagnant real wages. That has meant that the number of people who need to rent is rising. The proportion of 35 to 54-year-olds who live as private tenants has nearly doubled in 10 years. Meanwhile, protections afforded to renters have not kept pace. So, any plan to impose minimum terms to rental agreements of three years would benefit millions hoping for some security of tenure. But it may also cause problems. Landlords could have less flexibility in financing of their properties and have to pay higher interest rates to lenders, which could then be passed on to tenants.  Furthermore, tenants may not like being locked into long-term contracts if their own circumstances change and they need to move or even buy a house.Finding a middle ground won't be easy in the consultation.Shadow housing secretary John Healey said: ""Any fresh help for renters is welcome but this latest promise is meaningless if landlords can still force tenants out by hiking up the rent.He said Labour plans included controls on rents, an end to no-fault evictions and protection against substandard properties.Polly Neate, chief executive of charity Shelter, said: ""This is an important step forward. Losing a tenancy is the main driver of homelessness and also causes huge instability for renting families so everyone who rents will be very pleased to see a move towards longer tenancies. ""But if the government really wants to stand up and provide stability for renters, they can and should go beyond three years to provide real protection from eviction, and the huge upheaval of having to move home, jobs and schools.""The government needs to bring forward new legislation quickly - with tens of thousands of families already homeless and many more at risk of the same fate, we simply cannot wait."""
2018-07-01,Govia Thameslink 'could lose franchise',https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44671423,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowRail operator Govia Thameslink faces being stripped of its franchises unless performance on its services in the South East of England rapidly improves, the BBC understands.A source said the government could begin the process within weeks. Passengers on its Thameslink and Great Northern trains have endured more than a month of disruption following the introduction of new timetables in May. Meanwhile, the firm said it is working on plans to compensate passengers. ""The industry is working together on this and an announcement will be made in due course,"" said a spokesman for Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR). The BBC understands that commuters are set to receive compensation worth a month's travel. GTR - which also runs Southern and the Gatwick Express services - changed the time of every train on its timetable on 20 May.Passengers were warned of disruption before the changes were brought in, but the implementation of the new timetable saw some services withdrawn and further cancellations without any warning.Since then, GTR chief executive Charles Horton has resigned and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has faced calls to stand down - as MPs from across all parties voiced their concern at the disruption caused in their constituencies.Passengers have expressed their anger on social media, while last week a memo leaked by the RMT union revealed that extra security staff were at stations to protect staff from ""unhappy customers"".But there is also frustration within government that while Northern, which encountered similar problems in the North of England, has introduced an interim timetable, Govia Thameslink's equivalent is still a fortnight away. ""They are now in the last chance saloon,"" a government source told the BBC.Will Graves, from Arlesey in Bedfordshire, spends around £400 each month commuting to London - but told the BBC the current service is ""the worst I can remember in my 14 years of commuting"".Mr Graves said that trains are regularly cancelled and almost always delayed - often due to no driver being available.""When you do get on a train, you're standing shoulder to shoulder - it's horrendous,"" said Mr Graves. ""I think I've had only one journey that hasn't been delayed in the last month."" Trent Gashi, who commutes from Flitwick, Befordshire, to London, described Govia Thameslink's service as an ""utter farce"" and said ticket price rises in 2018 had ""added insult to injury"". ""Trains are cancelled without notice, people are ferried on and off as if they are livestock,"" said Mr Gashi.""They make so much money out of people like us. It needs to be seriously addressed by the government.""Mick Cash, general secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, has called for the UK's privatised rail networks to be brought back into public ownership ""on a permanent basis"".He described the ""last chance saloon"" comment as ""empty rhetoric"" that tells ""these basket-case companies"" that they have been ""let off the hook again while services are reduced to chaos"".He added: ""This is no time for empty threats from unnamed government sources.""Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said that, after ""months of chaos"" for passengers, he was in favour of Govia Thameslink losing its franchise.He tweeted: ""City Hall will push for @TfL to take over more commuter routes so we can provide Londoners with a better service.""A spokesman for Govia Thameslink refused to comment on the reports about the possible loss of the franchises, instead choosing to re-release a statement in which it said it was ""sorry for the disruption"". GTR had added it rescheduled every train in its franchise in an attempt to improve rail efficiency but it was a ""hugely complicated task"" and involved re-training drivers on new routes.Mr Grayling had previously announced there would be compensation for commuters and an inquiry into what went wrong, saying there had been ""major failures"" by the rail industry.A Department for Transport spokesman added: ""GTR passengers are encountering unacceptable service levels and the transport secretary and rail minister have been clear it is their priority that this is put right as soon as possible."""
2018-07-01,Surge in Britons getting EU nationality,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44629193,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThere has been a surge in UK citizens acquiring the nationality of another EU country since the Brexit referendum, according to data obtained by the BBC.In 2017 a total of 12,994 UK citizens obtained the nationality of one of the 17 member states from which the BBC has received figures. This compares with 5,025 in 2016 and only 1,800 in 2015.The most frequent new nationality was German, which saw a huge jump from just 594 cases in 2015 up to 7,493 in 2017. One applicant, Paul Petty, from Bath, gained a German passport and is now a dual German/British citizen. ""I feel like Europe is pulling apart a bit at the moment,"" he told the BBC. ""I want to remain part of the EU.""It took three weeks for Mr Petty to receive his new passport. He was eligible because of his mother's status as a Jewish refugee.He described the process as ""really easy"", as he still had his mother's passport.The rise is presumed to be the result of Britons who can meet the criteria seeking to keep their legal rights attached to European Union membership. The 2017 figure is about seven times the 2015 level.The dramatic increase is consistent across many countries.  France was the second most popular nationality, jumping from 320 instances in 2015 to 1,518 last year, and then Belgium, where the increase was from 127 to 1,381.The number for Ireland rose from 54 in 2015 to 529 in 2017. However, this does not include new Irish passport applications from the much larger number of people who already had entitlement to Irish citizenship, due for example to being born in Northern Ireland.Their new nationalities will guarantee the recipients the rights to travel, live and work throughout the EU after Brexit, and they may be able to pass these on to their children.  In most cases those involved have also retained their British citizenship and so have become dual nationals.Lucy Hales has been living in Italy for five years, having previously spent 12 years in Spain, and plans to apply for Italian passports. ""It is likely that we will move to another European country, because of my husband's job, so having Italian citizenship would give us some certainty,"" she said.The BBC has obtained this data for 2017 from 17 of the 27 other EU member states. In the other cases it is not yet ready for publication. These 17 include most of the particularly relevant countries, accounting for over three-quarters of all such new citizenships in 2016. Only a limited proportion of British citizens would qualify for citizenship of another EU state. The bureaucratic process of applying can be slow and laborious.The criteria vary from one country to another and are sometimes complex, usually depending on ancestry and family links or residency. In the case of Germany, there is special provision for people whose German ancestors were victims of Nazi persecution.British citizens who fit a nation's requirements will still be able to apply after Brexit, although for some countries there may be complications. For example, Germany allows dual nationality only with EU states. Unless this changes Britons who become German after Brexit has happened could then find they have to renounce their UK citizenship.

2018-07-01,"'Last call' for Brexit deal, Tusk warns",https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44655080,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDonald Tusk has issued a ""last call"" to the UK to ""lay the cards on the table"" if a Brexit deal is to be done in time.The European Council president said the ""most difficult"" issues were unresolved and ""quick progress"" was needed if agreement was to be reached by October.Talks continue over the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU in March next year. What happens to the Irish border remains a sticking point.The UK says both sides want to see a ""faster pace"" in talks.But Prime Minister Theresa May has been unable to say much new at this summit - the last one before October - because she has yet to get her cabinet to agree on a blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU. They are due to meet at Chequers next Friday, in what has been billed as a make-or-break meeting. Mrs May has said the UK will then publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"".Chancellor Angela Merkel said Mrs May would ""come to Germany and we will have a longer debate on this"", once the proposals were published.At the close of the summit, Mr Tusk told reporters there was a ""great deal of work ahead"" on Brexit and the ""most difficult tasks are still unresolved"". ""Quick progress"" was needed if a deal was to be reached at the next summit.""This is the last call to lay the cards on the table,"" he said.By the BBC's political editor Laura KuenssbergEuropean leaders can repeat the same message, louder and louder.But this EU summit's instructions to Theresa May may as well have been shouted into an empty cupboard.Because they know what she knows - that the past 24 hours of Brexit conversations are not nearly as important as the next seven days of discussions at home between Number 10 and the rest of the government.And after more than two years, this time next week ministers should be nearing the conclusion of their country retreat at Chequers.It's there that the prime minister hopes to find resolution in her team on a more detailed offer to the rest of the EU - easing, if not removing, all the contradictions in the Tories' positions.He was one of a string of EU chiefs demanding more clarity from the UK prime minister, who left the summit before the 27 other EU leaders discussed Brexit together on Friday.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the British had to ""make clear their position"" adding: ""We cannot go on to live with a split cabinet. They have to say what they want and we will respond to that.""EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned: ""The time is very short"" and that while progress had been made, ""huge and serious divergence remains, in particular on Ireland and Northern Ireland"".  He also said he hoped to see ""workable and realistic"" proposals from the UK on what the future relationship between the UK and EU should look like.He said he was ""ready to invite the UK delegation to come back to Brussels next Monday"" to continue working on a deal.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understood that UK officials had already informed the EU Commission they would not hold talks on Monday and the ""mini row over diaries"" revealed ""how tetchy things are"".Tensions revealed sometimes by tiny things - I hear Commission asked UK for talks next week, UK said no, so Barnier then invited them again in front of the camerasEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakEuropean leaders at the summit welcomed progress on the legal text of the withdrawal agreement but noted that ""important aspects still need to be agreed"" including the territorial application of the deal ""notably as regards Gibraltar"".  Talks between Spain and the UK over Gibraltar, including access to its airport and the exchange of tax information, continue. They also expressed concern that ""no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for Ireland/Northern Ireland"", if a deal on customs arrangements is not agreed by December 2020. when the transition period is due to end.And they called on member states and EU institutions ""to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes"" - the European Commission president has said the EU must prepare for the possibility that no Brexit deal will be reached.Mrs May's own cabinet is divided over what the UK's customs arrangements after December 2020 should look like, when the transition period agreed with the EU is due to end. And there are disagreements over the future movement of goods and people across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.But asked if he believed Mrs May could resolve the differences, Mr Juncker told the BBC he knew the prime minister and: ""yes ... she will"". Juncker tells us he believes the PM can get the cabinet to agree because ‘I know the British Prime Minister’End of Twitter post 2 by @bbclaurakOn Thursday, Mrs May said a strong future partnership with the EU was in everyone's interests.""I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that,"" she said.She added that the UK would publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail [the] strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"".But she urged fellow EU leaders to tell their negotiators the UK should be allowed to continue to take part in schemes like the Prum mechanism for sharing DNA profiles, the Second Generation Schengen Information System - a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System.Without UK participation in such schemes, she suggested their collective ability to fight terrorism would be reduced.Mrs May's Europe adviser Olly Robbins and Brexit Secretary David Davis were due to appear in front of the UK's Brexit select committee next week but it is understood that the appearance has been delayed until after the publication of the White Paper. Former Brexit minister Lord Bridges, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, told the Evening Standard there was a risk negotiations could become a ""rout"", if the cabinet could not compromise, first with each other, then with Europe.""If nothing changes, there's a danger the UK will have to agree to a withdrawal treaty full of meaningless waffle on our future relationship with the EU,"" warned Lord Bridges.""With so little leverage in the next phase, the negotiations would become a rout. Worse, uncertainty will drag on, damaging our economy."""
2018-07-01,Minister urged to save military airfields,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44654880,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA defence minister has been accused of going back on a commitment to keep 15 military airfields that are earmarked for closure in use for civil aviation. The airfields are due to be sold off, mostly for housing, over the next six years as part of MoD cost-cutting.MPs and peers on the all-party general aviation group say they are an important national asset.They say that Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood had agreed to ""look again"" at the aerodrome sell-offs.But all-party group chairman, Conservative MP Grant Shapps, said there were ""significant disparities"" between what Mr Ellwood had said and his subsequent follow-up letter to the group.""Our meeting with the defence minister was very worthwhile and extracted some helpful commitments, including supporting continued aviation use at the 15 military aerodromes being disposed of, where possible,"" said Mr Shapps. He said the group's members were ""very concerned to see no mention of these commitments in the minister's follow-up letter"".""As we celebrate 100 years of the Royal Air Force, which has inspired generations of young people into pursuing high-tech jobs in aviation, we have written back to the minister to ask specifically what the Ministry of Defence is doing to support general aviation. ""We look forward to the minister's reply.""The MPs and peers argue that the 15 airfields should be kept in use for private planes, gliders and flight training - known as general aviation - and to be kept in reserve for military use, in the event of a national emergency. In his written response, Mr Ellwood appeared to rule out the future use of the threatened airfields by other aircraft.He said he ""recognised the strength of feeling"" among the 157 members of the all-party aviation group.But he said private planes could still access 20 other military airfields in the UK and the closure of aerodromes used for pilot training was part of a plan to increase training capacity by concentrating it at fewer sites.He also rejected arguments that closing the airfields posed a security risk. ""I must assure you that the MoD does undertake the necessary investigative work to ensure that the safety and security of service personnel and UK citizens is not compromised,"" said the minister.The MoD said the sites were ""surplus to military requirements"" and as no bids have been received to turn them into civilian airfields they would be used to meet the ""needs of the local community"".A spokesperson said: ""Some of the airfields have not been active for decades, years if not decades, and are not fit for aircraft to land.""All proceeds from the sale of the sites will be reinvested back into defence.""The airfields earmarked for closure are:"

The British airline says it has informed the government of its decision, saying it was ""in the best interest of our customers and people"".It comes amid concern over the removal of Windrush generation migrants and LGBT asylum seekers. Activists are urging other airlines to take similar action.Virgin Atlantic said: ""We've made the decision to end all involuntary deportations on our network, and have already informed the Home Office.""A spokeswoman declined to give details of the number of Virgin Atlantic flights or individuals affected.According to the Guardian, Virgin has provided seats on its commercial flights to detainees and security officers accompanying them for many years. A charity in Jamaica that helps resettle deported people told the paper detainees regularly arrived on Virgin flights.Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes told Parliament last month the majority of enforced deportations used scheduled flights, where people sit alongside paying passengers.  She also revealed the government spent £17m on such flights between 2016 and 2017 and £17.3m between 2015 and 2016.  Activist group Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants said Virgin told it of the move in response to a yet-to-be published open letter it has written highlighting the deportations of people to countries where they risked persecution.Sam Bjorn from the group added: ""The fact that the company has finally opted to break with this controversial practice testifies to a profound shift in public opinion on deportation since the emergence of the Windrush scandal.""The Windrush scandal hit headlines in April after it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants.They were part of what is known as the Windrush generation - a reference to the Empire Windrush - the ship that brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948.Their treatment coincided with the Home Office's adoption of a ""hostile environment"" approach, designed to tackle the issue of illegal immigration, and so far, the department has identified 63 people as having been possibly wrongly deported.Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants wants British Airways and Qatar Airways - who also work on enforced deportations with the government - to end their involvement.Labour MP Stephen Doughty, who is on the Home Affairs Select Committee, has been questioning the government over its deportation policies and welcomed the move from Virgin Atlantic. He told the BBC: ""The whole system of detention and deportation appears to have serious flaws, not just for the Windrush generation, but other individuals who have been subject to wrongful detention - including one of my constituents.""So it is a business decision for airlines, around their culture and ethics.""Asked if other airlines should follow suit, Mr Doughty added: ""If they want to facilitate this system that has a series of questions around its checks and balances... well, they may want to think about it again.""  The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A Home Office spokesman said: ""We do not comment on operational matters."""
2018-07-01,EU leaders plan secure migrant centres,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44652846,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSecure centres for migrants may be set up in EU states to process asylum claims under a deal reached after marathon talks at a summit in Brussels.The controlled centres would be set up by EU states on a voluntary basis and migrants whose claims were rejected would be ""returned"".Refugees could be resettled in EU states which agreed to take them.The deal follows weeks of diplomatic wrangling over migrant rescue ships, and which country should take them in.Coastguard officials said on Friday that around 100 people were thought to have drowned off the Libyan coast, with 14 rescued.They were found in waters to the east of the capital, Tripoli.There were no details on which countries might set up the secure centres or take in refugees, but French President Emmanuel Macron said they would be in countries where migrants first arrived in the EU. ""We have struck the right balance between responsibility and solidarity,"" he said.Numbers illegally entering the EU have dropped 96% since their 2015 peak, the European Council says. Italy - the entry point for thousands of migrants, mainly from Africa - had threatened to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not receive help.""After this European summit, Europe is more responsible and offers more solidarity,"" said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. ""Today Italy is no longer alone.""Other leaders struck a more cautious note.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said more needed to be done to resolve disagreements.And European Council President Donald Tusk said it was ""too early to talk about a success"".""We have managed to reach an agreement in the European Council. But this is in fact the easiest part of the task, compared to what awaits us on the ground when we start implementing it,"" he told a news conference.By Adam Fleming, BBC News, BrusselsA few things stand out as wins for Italy's new prime minister. The summit's conclusions now include a statement about the need for boats that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean to respect international law. But the big one is approval of the concept of closed, secure processing facilities for migrants arriving in the EU. Some say this will make it easier to send back people whose claims for asylum are rejected. Others are already describing them as prisons. This paragraph is full of caveats, commas and sub-clauses - all the hallmarks of something drafted in the middle of the night. Another striking pledge is for an ambitious partnership with Africa. That's the EU trying to balance its tough internal approach with a friendly external one, and offering incentives to North African countries to host facilities where migrants can be assessed for resettlement in Europe.  The 28 EU leaders also agreed several other measures:Mr Conte had earlier taken the rare step of blocking the conclusions of the joint communiqué until the leaders had settled the migration issue. Both Italy and Greece want other countries to share the burden.However several Central European states have so far rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy.German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said that the migration issue could be a defining moment for the EU - but she also needed the summit to avert a political crisis at home that could bring down her government. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, from her Bavarian coalition partner the CSU, had given her a deadline of this weekend. He has threatened to start turning away migrants who have already registered elsewhere from the border in his home state.Without the CSU, Mrs Merkel would lose her parliamentary majority.After the talks, she acknowledged the EU still had ""a lot of work to do to bridge the different views"".About 56,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, the International Organization for Migration says. More than a million people arrived in 2015.This month's tensions over migrant rescue ships barred from entry to Italian ports - most recently German charity ship Lifeline - have put the issue firmly back in the EU spotlight.The Lifeline was only allowed to dock in Malta after intense diplomacy among several EU states, who each agreed to take some of the migrants on board. Malta said Norway had now also agreed to take a share.Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontières (MSF) branded the new EU deal inhumane. ""The only thing European states appear to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are, or what horrors they are escaping - and to demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations,"" MSF's emergencies chief Karline Kleijer said."

Macmillan Cancer Support, the Royal British Legion, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and Air Ambulances all run their own draws while the two largest operators - the People's Postcode Lottery and The Health Lottery - have raised £310m and £58m respectively since they were established in 2005 and 2011.Their beneficiaries have included Carers Trust, Dementia UK, Mencap, Dogs Trust, Maggies and the PDSA veterinary charity. The sector has been lobbying the government to relax the £10m limit on sales per lottery every year and the £4m limit per draw.They claim existing limits stifle growth, cause unnecessary bureaucracy and push up costs - reducing support for good causes.The culture department is now proposing amending the Gambling Act to raise the limits to £100m and £5m respectively while also lifting the maximum prize in each draw from £400,000 to £500,000.Culture Secretary Matthew Hancock told the BBC he wanted to do more for society lotteries, which have to give a minimum of 20% of the proceeds of ticket sales to good causes but are not barred from making profit. ""We strongly believe in the power of civil society, of people to improve the area they live in through get-up-and-go,"" he told Radio 4's Today. ""Lotteries can be a part of that.""But he said he was also mindful of any impact on the National Lottery - which has seen a sharp fall in its returns to good causes in the past 18 months.""The National Lottery obviously has a massively positive impact on the country in terms of how we support our sports stars and how much heritage has been saved for the nation,"" he said. ""We need to make sure we support society lotteries but not at the detriment of the National Lottery. ""What we are trying to do is open a debate on how best we do that but we want to see more going to good causes.""Some society lotteries have been criticised for the amount they give to good causes but they argue they complement, rather than eat into, the National Lottery's sales. The People's Postcode Lottery, whose 38 society lotteries raised £93m on behalf of good causes last year, welcomed the government's proposed changes but urged ministers to be more ""ambitious"" and recognise the success of the sector.The company said it was ""odd"" the limit on how much could be raised per draw had doubled between 2005 and 2009 but was now only set to rise by £1m despite the growth in the number of people taking part and proceeds raised. ""Unless the draw limit is future-proofed by being raised further than ministers propose, People's Postcode Lottery expect that additional administration costs will occur over the coming years - stopping charities getting vital funding,"" said its managing director Clara Govier.

In the report published on Friday, MPs and peers on the Joint Committee on Human Rights said the Home Office demonstrated a ""wholly incorrect approach to case-handling and to depriving people of their liberty"".Individuals were locked up unless they could satisfy officials they should not be detained - an approach with the report described as ""simply unlawful"".""It is for the Home Office to satisfy itself that it has a power to detain an individual - not for an individual to have to satisfy the Home Office that they should not be detained,"" the report said.The report added: ""The Home Office required standards of proof from members of the Windrush generation which went well beyond those required, even by its own guidance; and moreover were impossible for them to meet - and which would have been very difficult for anyone to meet.""This led to officials making perverse decisions about their status. Moreover, it seems that if those standards were not met, Home Office officials then considered that they had grounds to detain.""The committee examined two cases of Windrush migrants - Anthony Bryan, 60, and Paulette Wilson, 62  - who were both detained after being unable to show documents proving their immigration status.Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson both came to Britain from Jamaica as children in the 1960s. Giving evidence to the committee in May, Mr Bryan agreed with a suggestion that a factor in the way he was treated was because he was black.Grandfather Mr Bryan was held in a detention centre twice, for almost three weeks, last year while Ms Wilson was detained for a week.The committee said their experience in detention was ""traumatising and debilitating"".The case files showed that immigration officials dismissed ""ample information and evidence"" for the pair's right to be in the UK, the report said. Some of the evidence discounted by officials included their own accounts of their lives as well as testimonies from family members, people who had known them for decades and lawyers.The report said that detention powers should not be used for people living in the UK and who are unlikely to abscond, the report said.""Detention powers have been used unlawfully and inappropriately by the Home Office without assuring itself that it had a right to deprive individuals of their liberty,"" it said. ""There should be fundamental change in the law, culture and procedures to protect human rights in the work of the Home Office.""Harriet Harman, the committee chairwoman, said what had happened to Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson had been ""a total violation of their human rights by the state's most powerful government department"".She said some members of the Windrush generation had been treated ""shockingly"" and ""shamefully"" and she called for additional safeguards to be put in place.""What you've got to have is a system which allows - when something's going wrong - the individual to check it and there to be proper monitoring,"" she told Radio 4's Today.""There's no independent situation at all. So you've got Home Office officials literally ticking the box for somebody to be detained.""The inquiry rejected the Home Office's claim that the treatment of Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson was due to a ""a series of mistakes"". It said the explanation was not ""credible of sufficient"" and that a ""systemic failure"" is more likely the reason.The scandal led to the resignation of Home Secretary Amber Rudd and the promise from Theresa May of compensation where appropriate.Earlier this month, more than 2,000 people attended a thanksgiving service marking 70 years since the arrival of Caribbean migrants on the Windrush ship.The migrants were among the first to be recruited to rebuild post-war Britain.In 1971, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain.There are now 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971 - including the Windrush arrivals - according to estimates by Oxford University's Migration Observatory.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Sajid Javid pledged a ""fresh look"" at rules and said key parts of the UK's immigration policy will be reviewed."

2018-07-01,Political football,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/44656429,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEngland are through to the knock-out stages of the World Cup despite losing 1-0 to Belgium, and politicians are keen to get in on the action, with variable results.Ahead of Thursday's clash between England and Belgium in Kaliningrad, Prime Minister Theresa May was ambushed by Belgian PM Charles Michel who handed her a red Belgium football shirt which ominously had the word ""Hazard"" written on it.Chelsea's Eden Hazard is one of 12 players in the Belgian squad to ply their trade in the Premier League, alongside Manchester City's Vincent Kompany, and Manchester United's Romelu Lukaku. Mrs May says she wants a positive trading relationship with the EU after Brexit, and to keep the door open to highly skilled EU migrants. Perhaps that will include Belgian footballers.A few hours later, just as the teams were kicking off, Theresa May gave an England shirt to the Belgian PM.May has never shown much of an interest in football but she certainly knows her cricket, as she showed in an interview with BBC Test Match special last year.There is nothing new about politicians trying to capitalise on sporting success - but Brexit may have given things an extra edge.Irish PM Leo Varadkar, whose country failed to qualify for Russia after losing to Denmark in a play-off, told the BBC he wanted the Red Devils to win, not the Three Lions, on Thursday.Nigel Farage never misses an opportunity to fly the flag, or visit the pub, so it was no surprise to see pictures of him watching the England game at a Brussels bar.But when he draped himself in an England flag, handed to him by a friend, the Beer Factory bar, next door to the European Parliament, erupted in boos, according to The Daily Mirror. and European Parliament staff on a nearby table whipped out an EU flag.Then there is the generic ""come on England"" tweet, which seems straightforward enough, unless individual players are co-opted into the message.The Conservative Party's official Twitter account posted this just before the Belgium game:The two men pictured are Manchester United's Jesse Lingard, who scored against Panama, and Manchester City's Raheem Sterling.Jesse Lingard's political views are unknown. But three years ago, Raheem Sterling recorded a video pledging his support to Labour's Dawn Butler. Butler, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, was running to be re-elected as an MP in the part of North West London where Sterling grew up.The Labour leader is a football fan - he even presented EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier with an Arsenal shirt last year.But he was accused of making his own World Cup gaffe, sharing a quote by former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly ahead of England's game against Tunisia. As many on Twitter were quick to point out, Shankly was perhaps not the ideal person to provide pre-match inspiration for the England football team.The Scottish legend once said about playing for his country: ""It's fantastic. You look down at your dark blue shirt, and the wee lion looks up at you and says 'Get out after the English...!'""Some political World Cup slip-ups are a little more subtle. While the basic rules of football are familiar to just about everyone, using the wrong footballing phrase can give the game away.Conservative MP Nick Boles threw his support behind a campaign by the Sun newspaper to fly the St George's flag above government departments during England matches.But as any football fan will know, the World Cup ""play-offs"" are a series of matches to determine which teams qualify for the World Cup in the first place - not part of the actual tournament.The knockout phase in Russia - a series of matches between teams who came first or second in their groups, culminating in the World Cup final in Moscow on 15 July - is never referred to as the ""play-offs"".To be fair to Boles, he said his campaign was about reclaiming the flag and building a modern English identity rather than being about what's happening on on the pitch. Football is not his specialism, as he freely admitted in a 2014 tweet:The Sun's campaign was successful, and departments agreed to fly the St George's flag during matches.The Department for International Trade was so keen to draw attention to this that not only did they tweet about this, but they also emailed journalists to say that they had tweeted about this.The Labour Party also made a subtle linguistic slip-up in the run-up to the Belgium game.Jumping on the World Cup bandwagon to criticise Theresa May and her ministers, Labour tweeted that May's ""squad"" should be ""benched"". That might be something people would say in American sports commentary, but is not a phrase commonly heard in discussions about English football.But even if politicians' 2018 World Cup tweets are sometimes a bit clunky, they don't quite reach the heights of David Cameron's 2015 gaffe.In a speech during the election campaign the former prime minister mistakenly said he was a West Ham fan rather than an Aston Villa fan. He said he had gone ""off script"" with the remark and blamed it on a ""brain fade"", insisting ""I've been an Aston Villa fan all my life""."
2018-07-01,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44657460,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is proving to be a massive challenge in the Brexit negotiations, and talk of ""no deal"" is making a lot of people nervous. But it's not just in the UK that this matters, because the Republic of Ireland depends on trade with the United Kingdom for its economic well-being. There's been a lot of talk about north-south trade across the border with Northern Ireland, and the need to avoid any border checks. But in purely economic terms, east-west trade across the Irish Sea between Ireland and Great Britain is far more important.   The vast majority of freight traffic leaving the Republic of Ireland is exported from Dublin, with the busiest routes to ports such as Liverpool and Holyhead.How much trade are we talking about? One way of measuring it is to look at the data on roll-on roll-off freight containers, many of them carrying food and other retail items that people rely on every day. Roll-on, roll-off (or Ro-Ro) refers to containers transported on lorries or trailers, while lift-on, lift-off (or Lo-Lo) refers to containers that are loaded on to ships by cranes. (And yes, Rolos are still made of chocolate.) Ro-Ro transport is important for produce that needs to get to market quickly, or for just-in-time manufacturing processes that rely on hourly deliveries of components. Ireland's Central Statistics Office released figures on 29 June, which show that in 2017 553,630 loaded Ro-Ro freight containers, on lorries or trailers, were shipped from Ireland to the rest of the world. The vast majority were heading for other ports in the EU. Only a tiny number - 24 - went to ports elsewhere. About 85% of Ireland's total EU freight trade goes via British ports - 475,925 containers last year. We can break that number down a bit further. The Irish Freight Transport Association estimates that the final destination of roughly 60% of the 475,925 freight containers shipped to Britain is Britain itself.That means the other 40% - roughly 190,000 per year - is destined for elsewhere in the EU, transiting across Britain via ports such as Dover or Hull, or via the Channel Tunnel. No-one knows the exact number, although Ireland's Department of Transport has commissioned in-depth research that should be released shortly. But one thing is clear: any kind of breakdown or problem posed by the failure to reach a Brexit agreement could have a huge impact, not just on Ireland's trade with the UK, but also on Ireland's trade with the rest of the EU. Don't forget that in this article we've just looked at Irish exports. Ireland is equally dependent on trade with the UK for its imports.Ireland currently sends lots of its exports to other countries via Britain because it is quicker than doing the whole journey by sea.Could Ireland try to cut out the so-called British land bridge and trade more directly with the rest of the EU? Some steps are already being taken in that direction.  One Luxembourg-based shipping company, CLdN, has just introduced two huge new Ro-Ro freight ferries on the direct sea route from Dublin to the Dutch port of Rotterdam, and to Zeebrugge in Belgium. The new ferries are the largest short-sea Ro-Ro vessels (ones that do not cross oceans) in the world, and can carry 650 cargo units on each voyage.When one of them, the MV Celine, was christened in Dublin in April, the chief executive of Dublin Port Company, Eamonn O'Reilly, said: ""The addition of new ships and sailings shows the shipping sector's resilience and ability to adapt to changing customer needs, particularly in response to Brexit.""""We expect MV Celine will mark the beginning of additional services to continental Europe from Dublin port over the coming years.""  Extra freight capacity is already being phased in on ferry routes between Dublin and Cherbourg, in France, as well as between Cork and Santander, in Spain.  But to give some idea of the extent to which Ireland relies on the British land bridge, statistics from the Port of Dublin show that last year it sent 31,875 loaded Ro-Ro containers to Belgium and Holland, while it sent 188,902 containers to Holyhead alone.So while some contingency plans are already being made, it's not nearly enough to replace the trade that currently goes to or through Britain. And that is a reminder that Ireland needs a good Brexit deal almost as much as the UK does. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

""The fragility of the EU is increasing,"" warns EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. ""The cracks are growing in size.""It's been easy to get distracted this last couple of weeks by the new Italian government and its headline-grabbing rejection of NGO migrant rescue boats. But Mr Juncker is right: EU fissures go deeper and are more widespread.Migration pits southern Europe against the north. Italy and Greece smoulder with resentment at having been left alone to deal with migrant arrivals. Meanwhile, northern countries blame the south for not patrolling their Mediterranean borders better and for having, at least in the past, enabled migrants to ""slip away"" northwards towards richer Germany, Austria and Sweden.Read more from Katya: EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics?Migration slashes the EU from east to west too.Newer member states from Central and Eastern Europe never signed up to the post World War Two ""all for one and one for all"" vision. When it comes to EU solidarity and burden-sharing, they are fervent non-believers. They determinedly turn their backs when Italy and Germany plead for migrant quotas.The number of migrants arriving illegally in Europe may be down, but so is voter tolerance of the problem.The rise and rise across the EU of tough-on-migration politicians has emboldened hardliners such as Hungary's Victor Orban and Austria's Sebastian Kurz, who takes over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU this Sunday and will push migration as a top priority.""Keep Them Out"" is Austria's main aim and while Europe's (still) most influential leader, Angela Merkel, arrives in Brussels on Thursday pushing - and praying - for compromise on burden-sharing and prevention, the number of EU leaders pushing single-mindedly on the migrant deterrence button is growing.Which brings me to the next layer of European splits provoked by migration: within national governments as well as between countries. Germany is the most dramatic example.Mrs Merkel has clearly been weakened at home by her previous open-door migrant policy. Formerly viewed as politically untouchable, the German chancellor has now been given an ultimatum by her own interior minister.""By the end of this Brussels summit, you need to come home with a workable pan-European solution to stop irregular migrants bleeding into Germany,"" Horst Seehofer has threatened her. ""Or I will unilaterally slam Germany's borders shut.""The Austrian government told me this week it would then immediately follow suit, causing a border-closing domino effect across Europe - with a seismic impact on the EU's prize political and economic project: the open-border Schengen agreement. What a blow for Brussels and nightmare for Europe's export-king Germany that would be. Of course we're not there yet.In true European Union style, once gathered round a table here in Brussels, there will undoubtedly be emphasis on what unites rather than divides member countries.On migration, EU leaders will easily agree to beef up their Frontex border guard. There's also growing convergence around the idea of setting up so-called disembarkation centres outside the EU to identify economic migrants, who in theory could be sent home. Those with a right to asylum or refugee status could then be given safe and legal passage to Europe.And there's much talk of closer co-operation (read: money) with migrant countries of origin and the transit countries (read: Libya and its coastguard) that migrants cross to make their way to people smuggler boats.But these ideas are easier to formulate than to carry out.You would need a lot of EU border guards to truly patrol southern Europe's thousands of miles of open coastline. You would need permission from African countries such as Niger and Chad to set up processing centres, for example. So far that's a distant goal.In the meantime, there is no whiff of EU agreement over what to do with migrants who do reach Europe.Which brings us back to the threat to Schengen.Gloomy German government sources told me they gave the project a three out of 10 chance of survival thanks to the increasingly nationalistic nature of many European governments.""And if Schengen does fail,"" they predict, ""that would be the beginning of the end of the European Union.""It's too early really to herald the demise of the EU or even the end of Mrs Merkel's career in government as a result of this very political migrant crisis in Europe.But, as EU summit host Donald Tusk said to EU leaders on the eve of their arrival: ""The stakes are very high. And time is short."""

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-01,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.

2018-07-02,Longer tenancies for renters proposed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44671094,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA minimum tenancy term of three years would be introduced under government proposals to give people renting homes in England more security.Figures show 80% of tenants currently have contracts of six or 12 months and ministers say longer agreements would allow them to put down more roots. They add tenants would be able to leave earlier under the plans while landlords would get more financial security.  Labour says the plans do not go far enough and rent rises should be capped. Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said loss of tenancy was ""the main driver of homelessness"" and called for the government to ""go beyond three years"".A consultation on the minimum tenancy term will run until the end of the August.Exemptions to the rules could apply to some types of tenant - for instance those in student accommodation.Government figures show renters do stay in a property for an average of four years but most have shorter contracts.George Robertson, a landlord from St Albans, is concerned about how the proposals will affect him. ""I am a landlord with one house used as a pension top-up after my wife's state pension age was hiked up at short notice,"" he said.  ""We feel this proposal will force small landlords like us, with just one property, out of the market [and] it will make it so much harder to manage difficulties with problem tenants. ""If this becomes law I will sell my property as we couldn't face the hassle of dealing with possible issues."" Jonathan Pearson, a renter living in London, is worried the proposals will mean less flexibility for tenants.""If in future I say I only plan on renting for less than three years, that would reduce my chances of securing a property,"" said Mr Pearson.He said the real problem was the ""attitude of estate agents"", who treat tenants as a ""commodity"" and ""charge ridiculous tenancy renewal fees after the 12 month period is up"".But Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said it was an important step forward for tenants. He added: ""It is deeply unfair when renters are forced to uproot their lives or find new schools for their children at short notice due to the terms of their rental contract.""Being able to call your rental property your home is vital to putting down roots and building stronger communities.""By BBC business correspondent Joe LynamSomething significant has happened to home ownership in the UK - it's dropped from 72% a decade ago to 63% last year. Much of that is down to affordability - especially in the south east of England, bank reticence to lend and stagnant real wages. That has meant that the number of people who need to rent is rising. The proportion of 35 to 54-year-olds who live as private tenants has nearly doubled in 10 years. Meanwhile, protections afforded to renters have not kept pace. So, any plan to impose minimum terms to rental agreements of three years would benefit millions hoping for some security of tenure. But it may also cause problems. Landlords could have less flexibility in financing of their properties and have to pay higher interest rates to lenders, which could then be passed on to tenants.  Furthermore, tenants may not like being locked into long-term contracts if their own circumstances change and they need to move or even buy a house.Finding a middle ground won't be easy in the consultation.Shadow housing secretary John Healey said: ""Any fresh help for renters is welcome but this latest promise is meaningless if landlords can still force tenants out by hiking up the rent.He said Labour plans included controls on rents, an end to no-fault evictions and protection against substandard properties.Polly Neate, chief executive of charity Shelter, said: ""This is an important step forward. Losing a tenancy is the main driver of homelessness and also causes huge instability for renting families so everyone who rents will be very pleased to see a move towards longer tenancies. ""But if the government really wants to stand up and provide stability for renters, they can and should go beyond three years to provide real protection from eviction, and the huge upheaval of having to move home, jobs and schools.""The government needs to bring forward new legislation quickly - with tens of thousands of families already homeless and many more at risk of the same fate, we simply cannot wait."""
2018-07-02,Govia Thameslink 'could lose franchise',https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44671423,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowRail operator Govia Thameslink faces being stripped of its franchises unless performance on its services in the South East of England rapidly improves, the BBC understands.A source said the government could begin the process within weeks. Passengers on its Thameslink and Great Northern trains have endured more than a month of disruption following the introduction of new timetables in May. Meanwhile, the firm said it is working on plans to compensate passengers. ""The industry is working together on this and an announcement will be made in due course,"" said a spokesman for Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR). The BBC understands that commuters are set to receive compensation worth a month's travel. GTR - which also runs Southern and the Gatwick Express services - changed the time of every train on its timetable on 20 May.Passengers were warned of disruption before the changes were brought in, but the implementation of the new timetable saw some services withdrawn and further cancellations without any warning.Since then, GTR chief executive Charles Horton has resigned and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has faced calls to stand down - as MPs from across all parties voiced their concern at the disruption caused in their constituencies.Passengers have expressed their anger on social media, while last week a memo leaked by the RMT union revealed that extra security staff were at stations to protect staff from ""unhappy customers"".But there is also frustration within government that while Northern, which encountered similar problems in the North of England, has introduced an interim timetable, Govia Thameslink's equivalent is still a fortnight away. ""They are now in the last chance saloon,"" a government source told the BBC.Will Graves, from Arlesey in Bedfordshire, spends around £400 each month commuting to London - but told the BBC the current service is ""the worst I can remember in my 14 years of commuting"".Mr Graves said that trains are regularly cancelled and almost always delayed - often due to no driver being available.""When you do get on a train, you're standing shoulder to shoulder - it's horrendous,"" said Mr Graves. ""I think I've had only one journey that hasn't been delayed in the last month."" Trent Gashi, who commutes from Flitwick, Befordshire, to London, described Govia Thameslink's service as an ""utter farce"" and said ticket price rises in 2018 had ""added insult to injury"". ""Trains are cancelled without notice, people are ferried on and off as if they are livestock,"" said Mr Gashi.""They make so much money out of people like us. It needs to be seriously addressed by the government.""Mick Cash, general secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, has called for the UK's privatised rail networks to be brought back into public ownership ""on a permanent basis"".He described the ""last chance saloon"" comment as ""empty rhetoric"" that tells ""these basket-case companies"" that they have been ""let off the hook again while services are reduced to chaos"".He added: ""This is no time for empty threats from unnamed government sources.""Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said that, after ""months of chaos"" for passengers, he was in favour of Govia Thameslink losing its franchise.He tweeted: ""City Hall will push for @TfL to take over more commuter routes so we can provide Londoners with a better service.""A spokesman for Govia Thameslink refused to comment on the reports about the possible loss of the franchises, instead choosing to re-release a statement in which it said it was ""sorry for the disruption"". GTR had added it rescheduled every train in its franchise in an attempt to improve rail efficiency but it was a ""hugely complicated task"" and involved re-training drivers on new routes.Mr Grayling had previously announced there would be compensation for commuters and an inquiry into what went wrong, saying there had been ""major failures"" by the rail industry.A Department for Transport spokesman added: ""GTR passengers are encountering unacceptable service levels and the transport secretary and rail minister have been clear it is their priority that this is put right as soon as possible."""
2018-07-02,Surge in Britons getting EU nationality,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44629193,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThere has been a surge in UK citizens acquiring the nationality of another EU country since the Brexit referendum, according to data obtained by the BBC.In 2017 a total of 12,994 UK citizens obtained the nationality of one of the 17 member states from which the BBC has received figures. This compares with 5,025 in 2016 and only 1,800 in 2015.The most frequent new nationality was German, which saw a huge jump from just 594 cases in 2015 up to 7,493 in 2017. One applicant, Paul Petty, from Bath, gained a German passport and is now a dual German/British citizen. ""I feel like Europe is pulling apart a bit at the moment,"" he told the BBC. ""I want to remain part of the EU.""It took three weeks for Mr Petty to receive his new passport. He was eligible because of his mother's status as a Jewish refugee.He described the process as ""really easy"", as he still had his mother's passport.The rise is presumed to be the result of Britons who can meet the criteria seeking to keep their legal rights attached to European Union membership. The 2017 figure is about seven times the 2015 level.The dramatic increase is consistent across many countries.  France was the second most popular nationality, jumping from 320 instances in 2015 to 1,518 last year, and then Belgium, where the increase was from 127 to 1,381.The number for Ireland rose from 54 in 2015 to 529 in 2017. However, this does not include new Irish passport applications from the much larger number of people who already had entitlement to Irish citizenship, due for example to being born in Northern Ireland.Their new nationalities will guarantee the recipients the rights to travel, live and work throughout the EU after Brexit, and they may be able to pass these on to their children.  In most cases those involved have also retained their British citizenship and so have become dual nationals.Lucy Hales has been living in Italy for five years, having previously spent 12 years in Spain, and plans to apply for Italian passports. ""It is likely that we will move to another European country, because of my husband's job, so having Italian citizenship would give us some certainty,"" she said.The BBC has obtained this data for 2017 from 17 of the 27 other EU member states. In the other cases it is not yet ready for publication. These 17 include most of the particularly relevant countries, accounting for over three-quarters of all such new citizenships in 2016. Only a limited proportion of British citizens would qualify for citizenship of another EU state. The bureaucratic process of applying can be slow and laborious.The criteria vary from one country to another and are sometimes complex, usually depending on ancestry and family links or residency. In the case of Germany, there is special provision for people whose German ancestors were victims of Nazi persecution.British citizens who fit a nation's requirements will still be able to apply after Brexit, although for some countries there may be complications. For example, Germany allows dual nationality only with EU states. Unless this changes Britons who become German after Brexit has happened could then find they have to renounce their UK citizenship.

2018-07-02,"'Last call' for Brexit deal, Tusk warns",https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44655080,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDonald Tusk has issued a ""last call"" to the UK to ""lay the cards on the table"" if a Brexit deal is to be done in time.The European Council president said the ""most difficult"" issues were unresolved and ""quick progress"" was needed if agreement was to be reached by October.Talks continue over the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU in March next year. What happens to the Irish border remains a sticking point.The UK says both sides want to see a ""faster pace"" in talks.But Prime Minister Theresa May has been unable to say much new at this summit - the last one before October - because she has yet to get her cabinet to agree on a blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU. They are due to meet at Chequers next Friday, in what has been billed as a make-or-break meeting. Mrs May has said the UK will then publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"".Chancellor Angela Merkel said Mrs May would ""come to Germany and we will have a longer debate on this"", once the proposals were published.At the close of the summit, Mr Tusk told reporters there was a ""great deal of work ahead"" on Brexit and the ""most difficult tasks are still unresolved"". ""Quick progress"" was needed if a deal was to be reached at the next summit.""This is the last call to lay the cards on the table,"" he said.By the BBC's political editor Laura KuenssbergEuropean leaders can repeat the same message, louder and louder.But this EU summit's instructions to Theresa May may as well have been shouted into an empty cupboard.Because they know what she knows - that the past 24 hours of Brexit conversations are not nearly as important as the next seven days of discussions at home between Number 10 and the rest of the government.And after more than two years, this time next week ministers should be nearing the conclusion of their country retreat at Chequers.It's there that the prime minister hopes to find resolution in her team on a more detailed offer to the rest of the EU - easing, if not removing, all the contradictions in the Tories' positions.He was one of a string of EU chiefs demanding more clarity from the UK prime minister, who left the summit before the 27 other EU leaders discussed Brexit together on Friday.European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the British had to ""make clear their position"" adding: ""We cannot go on to live with a split cabinet. They have to say what they want and we will respond to that.""EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned: ""The time is very short"" and that while progress had been made, ""huge and serious divergence remains, in particular on Ireland and Northern Ireland"".  He also said he hoped to see ""workable and realistic"" proposals from the UK on what the future relationship between the UK and EU should look like.He said he was ""ready to invite the UK delegation to come back to Brussels next Monday"" to continue working on a deal.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understood that UK officials had already informed the EU Commission they would not hold talks on Monday and the ""mini row over diaries"" revealed ""how tetchy things are"".Tensions revealed sometimes by tiny things - I hear Commission asked UK for talks next week, UK said no, so Barnier then invited them again in front of the camerasEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakEuropean leaders at the summit welcomed progress on the legal text of the withdrawal agreement but noted that ""important aspects still need to be agreed"" including the territorial application of the deal ""notably as regards Gibraltar"".  Talks between Spain and the UK over Gibraltar, including access to its airport and the exchange of tax information, continue. They also expressed concern that ""no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for Ireland/Northern Ireland"", if a deal on customs arrangements is not agreed by December 2020. when the transition period is due to end.And they called on member states and EU institutions ""to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes"" - the European Commission president has said the EU must prepare for the possibility that no Brexit deal will be reached.Mrs May's own cabinet is divided over what the UK's customs arrangements after December 2020 should look like, when the transition period agreed with the EU is due to end. And there are disagreements over the future movement of goods and people across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.But asked if he believed Mrs May could resolve the differences, Mr Juncker told the BBC he knew the prime minister and: ""yes ... she will"". Juncker tells us he believes the PM can get the cabinet to agree because ‘I know the British Prime Minister’End of Twitter post 2 by @bbclaurakOn Thursday, Mrs May said a strong future partnership with the EU was in everyone's interests.""I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that,"" she said.She added that the UK would publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail [the] strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"".But she urged fellow EU leaders to tell their negotiators the UK should be allowed to continue to take part in schemes like the Prum mechanism for sharing DNA profiles, the Second Generation Schengen Information System - a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System.Without UK participation in such schemes, she suggested their collective ability to fight terrorism would be reduced.Mrs May's Europe adviser Olly Robbins and Brexit Secretary David Davis were due to appear in front of the UK's Brexit select committee next week but it is understood that the appearance has been delayed until after the publication of the White Paper. Former Brexit minister Lord Bridges, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, told the Evening Standard there was a risk negotiations could become a ""rout"", if the cabinet could not compromise, first with each other, then with Europe.""If nothing changes, there's a danger the UK will have to agree to a withdrawal treaty full of meaningless waffle on our future relationship with the EU,"" warned Lord Bridges.""With so little leverage in the next phase, the negotiations would become a rout. Worse, uncertainty will drag on, damaging our economy."""

The airfields are due to be sold off, mostly for housing, over the next six years as part of MoD cost-cutting.MPs and peers on the all-party general aviation group say they are an important national asset.They say that Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood had agreed to ""look again"" at the aerodrome sell-offs.But all-party group chairman, Conservative MP Grant Shapps, said there were ""significant disparities"" between what Mr Ellwood had said and his subsequent follow-up letter to the group.""Our meeting with the defence minister was very worthwhile and extracted some helpful commitments, including supporting continued aviation use at the 15 military aerodromes being disposed of, where possible,"" said Mr Shapps. He said the group's members were ""very concerned to see no mention of these commitments in the minister's follow-up letter"".""As we celebrate 100 years of the Royal Air Force, which has inspired generations of young people into pursuing high-tech jobs in aviation, we have written back to the minister to ask specifically what the Ministry of Defence is doing to support general aviation. ""We look forward to the minister's reply.""The MPs and peers argue that the 15 airfields should be kept in use for private planes, gliders and flight training - known as general aviation - and to be kept in reserve for military use, in the event of a national emergency. In his written response, Mr Ellwood appeared to rule out the future use of the threatened airfields by other aircraft.He said he ""recognised the strength of feeling"" among the 157 members of the all-party aviation group.But he said private planes could still access 20 other military airfields in the UK and the closure of aerodromes used for pilot training was part of a plan to increase training capacity by concentrating it at fewer sites.He also rejected arguments that closing the airfields posed a security risk. ""I must assure you that the MoD does undertake the necessary investigative work to ensure that the safety and security of service personnel and UK citizens is not compromised,"" said the minister.The MoD said the sites were ""surplus to military requirements"" and as no bids have been received to turn them into civilian airfields they would be used to meet the ""needs of the local community"".A spokesperson said: ""Some of the airfields have not been active for decades, years if not decades, and are not fit for aircraft to land.""All proceeds from the sale of the sites will be reinvested back into defence.""The airfields earmarked for closure are:"

The British airline says it has informed the government of its decision, saying it was ""in the best interest of our customers and people"".It comes amid concern over the removal of Windrush generation migrants and LGBT asylum seekers. Activists are urging other airlines to take similar action.Virgin Atlantic said: ""We've made the decision to end all involuntary deportations on our network, and have already informed the Home Office.""A spokeswoman declined to give details of the number of Virgin Atlantic flights or individuals affected.According to the Guardian, Virgin has provided seats on its commercial flights to detainees and security officers accompanying them for many years. A charity in Jamaica that helps resettle deported people told the paper detainees regularly arrived on Virgin flights.Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes told Parliament last month the majority of enforced deportations used scheduled flights, where people sit alongside paying passengers.  She also revealed the government spent £17m on such flights between 2016 and 2017 and £17.3m between 2015 and 2016.  Activist group Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants said Virgin told it of the move in response to a yet-to-be published open letter it has written highlighting the deportations of people to countries where they risked persecution.Sam Bjorn from the group added: ""The fact that the company has finally opted to break with this controversial practice testifies to a profound shift in public opinion on deportation since the emergence of the Windrush scandal.""The Windrush scandal hit headlines in April after it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants.They were part of what is known as the Windrush generation - a reference to the Empire Windrush - the ship that brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948.Their treatment coincided with the Home Office's adoption of a ""hostile environment"" approach, designed to tackle the issue of illegal immigration, and so far, the department has identified 63 people as having been possibly wrongly deported.Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants wants British Airways and Qatar Airways - who also work on enforced deportations with the government - to end their involvement.Labour MP Stephen Doughty, who is on the Home Affairs Select Committee, has been questioning the government over its deportation policies and welcomed the move from Virgin Atlantic. He told the BBC: ""The whole system of detention and deportation appears to have serious flaws, not just for the Windrush generation, but other individuals who have been subject to wrongful detention - including one of my constituents.""So it is a business decision for airlines, around their culture and ethics.""Asked if other airlines should follow suit, Mr Doughty added: ""If they want to facilitate this system that has a series of questions around its checks and balances... well, they may want to think about it again.""  The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A Home Office spokesman said: ""We do not comment on operational matters."""
2018-07-02,EU leaders plan secure migrant centres,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44652846,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSecure centres for migrants may be set up in EU states to process asylum claims under a deal reached after marathon talks at a summit in Brussels.The controlled centres would be set up by EU states on a voluntary basis and migrants whose claims were rejected would be ""returned"".Refugees could be resettled in EU states which agreed to take them.The deal follows weeks of diplomatic wrangling over migrant rescue ships, and which country should take them in.Coastguard officials said on Friday that around 100 people were thought to have drowned off the Libyan coast, with 14 rescued.They were found in waters to the east of the capital, Tripoli.There were no details on which countries might set up the secure centres or take in refugees, but French President Emmanuel Macron said they would be in countries where migrants first arrived in the EU. ""We have struck the right balance between responsibility and solidarity,"" he said.Numbers illegally entering the EU have dropped 96% since their 2015 peak, the European Council says. Italy - the entry point for thousands of migrants, mainly from Africa - had threatened to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not receive help.""After this European summit, Europe is more responsible and offers more solidarity,"" said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. ""Today Italy is no longer alone.""Other leaders struck a more cautious note.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said more needed to be done to resolve disagreements.And European Council President Donald Tusk said it was ""too early to talk about a success"".""We have managed to reach an agreement in the European Council. But this is in fact the easiest part of the task, compared to what awaits us on the ground when we start implementing it,"" he told a news conference.By Adam Fleming, BBC News, BrusselsA few things stand out as wins for Italy's new prime minister. The summit's conclusions now include a statement about the need for boats that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean to respect international law. But the big one is approval of the concept of closed, secure processing facilities for migrants arriving in the EU. Some say this will make it easier to send back people whose claims for asylum are rejected. Others are already describing them as prisons. This paragraph is full of caveats, commas and sub-clauses - all the hallmarks of something drafted in the middle of the night. Another striking pledge is for an ambitious partnership with Africa. That's the EU trying to balance its tough internal approach with a friendly external one, and offering incentives to North African countries to host facilities where migrants can be assessed for resettlement in Europe.  The 28 EU leaders also agreed several other measures:Mr Conte had earlier taken the rare step of blocking the conclusions of the joint communiqué until the leaders had settled the migration issue. Both Italy and Greece want other countries to share the burden.However several Central European states have so far rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy.German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said that the migration issue could be a defining moment for the EU - but she also needed the summit to avert a political crisis at home that could bring down her government. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, from her Bavarian coalition partner the CSU, had given her a deadline of this weekend. He has threatened to start turning away migrants who have already registered elsewhere from the border in his home state.Without the CSU, Mrs Merkel would lose her parliamentary majority.After the talks, she acknowledged the EU still had ""a lot of work to do to bridge the different views"".About 56,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, the International Organization for Migration says. More than a million people arrived in 2015.This month's tensions over migrant rescue ships barred from entry to Italian ports - most recently German charity ship Lifeline - have put the issue firmly back in the EU spotlight.The Lifeline was only allowed to dock in Malta after intense diplomacy among several EU states, who each agreed to take some of the migrants on board. Malta said Norway had now also agreed to take a share.Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontières (MSF) branded the new EU deal inhumane. ""The only thing European states appear to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are, or what horrors they are escaping - and to demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations,"" MSF's emergencies chief Karline Kleijer said."

Macmillan Cancer Support, the Royal British Legion, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and Air Ambulances all run their own draws while the two largest operators - the People's Postcode Lottery and The Health Lottery - have raised £310m and £58m respectively since they were established in 2005 and 2011.Their beneficiaries have included Carers Trust, Dementia UK, Mencap, Dogs Trust, Maggies and the PDSA veterinary charity. The sector has been lobbying the government to relax the £10m limit on sales per lottery every year and the £4m limit per draw.They claim existing limits stifle growth, cause unnecessary bureaucracy and push up costs - reducing support for good causes.The culture department is now proposing amending the Gambling Act to raise the limits to £100m and £5m respectively while also lifting the maximum prize in each draw from £400,000 to £500,000.Culture Secretary Matthew Hancock told the BBC he wanted to do more for society lotteries, which have to give a minimum of 20% of the proceeds of ticket sales to good causes but are not barred from making profit. ""We strongly believe in the power of civil society, of people to improve the area they live in through get-up-and-go,"" he told Radio 4's Today. ""Lotteries can be a part of that.""But he said he was also mindful of any impact on the National Lottery - which has seen a sharp fall in its returns to good causes in the past 18 months.""The National Lottery obviously has a massively positive impact on the country in terms of how we support our sports stars and how much heritage has been saved for the nation,"" he said. ""We need to make sure we support society lotteries but not at the detriment of the National Lottery. ""What we are trying to do is open a debate on how best we do that but we want to see more going to good causes.""Some society lotteries have been criticised for the amount they give to good causes but they argue they complement, rather than eat into, the National Lottery's sales. The People's Postcode Lottery, whose 38 society lotteries raised £93m on behalf of good causes last year, welcomed the government's proposed changes but urged ministers to be more ""ambitious"" and recognise the success of the sector.The company said it was ""odd"" the limit on how much could be raised per draw had doubled between 2005 and 2009 but was now only set to rise by £1m despite the growth in the number of people taking part and proceeds raised. ""Unless the draw limit is future-proofed by being raised further than ministers propose, People's Postcode Lottery expect that additional administration costs will occur over the coming years - stopping charities getting vital funding,"" said its managing director Clara Govier.

In the report published on Friday, MPs and peers on the Joint Committee on Human Rights said the Home Office demonstrated a ""wholly incorrect approach to case-handling and to depriving people of their liberty"".Individuals were locked up unless they could satisfy officials they should not be detained - an approach with the report described as ""simply unlawful"".""It is for the Home Office to satisfy itself that it has a power to detain an individual - not for an individual to have to satisfy the Home Office that they should not be detained,"" the report said.The report added: ""The Home Office required standards of proof from members of the Windrush generation which went well beyond those required, even by its own guidance; and moreover were impossible for them to meet - and which would have been very difficult for anyone to meet.""This led to officials making perverse decisions about their status. Moreover, it seems that if those standards were not met, Home Office officials then considered that they had grounds to detain.""The committee examined two cases of Windrush migrants - Anthony Bryan, 60, and Paulette Wilson, 62  - who were both detained after being unable to show documents proving their immigration status.Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson both came to Britain from Jamaica as children in the 1960s. Giving evidence to the committee in May, Mr Bryan agreed with a suggestion that a factor in the way he was treated was because he was black.Grandfather Mr Bryan was held in a detention centre twice, for almost three weeks, last year while Ms Wilson was detained for a week.The committee said their experience in detention was ""traumatising and debilitating"".The case files showed that immigration officials dismissed ""ample information and evidence"" for the pair's right to be in the UK, the report said. Some of the evidence discounted by officials included their own accounts of their lives as well as testimonies from family members, people who had known them for decades and lawyers.The report said that detention powers should not be used for people living in the UK and who are unlikely to abscond, the report said.""Detention powers have been used unlawfully and inappropriately by the Home Office without assuring itself that it had a right to deprive individuals of their liberty,"" it said. ""There should be fundamental change in the law, culture and procedures to protect human rights in the work of the Home Office.""Harriet Harman, the committee chairwoman, said what had happened to Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson had been ""a total violation of their human rights by the state's most powerful government department"".She said some members of the Windrush generation had been treated ""shockingly"" and ""shamefully"" and she called for additional safeguards to be put in place.""What you've got to have is a system which allows - when something's going wrong - the individual to check it and there to be proper monitoring,"" she told Radio 4's Today.""There's no independent situation at all. So you've got Home Office officials literally ticking the box for somebody to be detained.""The inquiry rejected the Home Office's claim that the treatment of Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson was due to a ""a series of mistakes"". It said the explanation was not ""credible of sufficient"" and that a ""systemic failure"" is more likely the reason.The scandal led to the resignation of Home Secretary Amber Rudd and the promise from Theresa May of compensation where appropriate.Earlier this month, more than 2,000 people attended a thanksgiving service marking 70 years since the arrival of Caribbean migrants on the Windrush ship.The migrants were among the first to be recruited to rebuild post-war Britain.In 1971, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain.There are now 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971 - including the Windrush arrivals - according to estimates by Oxford University's Migration Observatory.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Sajid Javid pledged a ""fresh look"" at rules and said key parts of the UK's immigration policy will be reviewed."

Mrs May says she wants a positive trading relationship with the EU after Brexit, and to keep the door open to highly skilled EU migrants. Perhaps that will include Belgian footballers.A few hours later, just as the teams were kicking off, Theresa May gave an England shirt to the Belgian PM.May has never shown much of an interest in football but she certainly knows her cricket, as she showed in an interview with BBC Test Match special last year.There is nothing new about politicians trying to capitalise on sporting success - but Brexit may have given things an extra edge.Irish PM Leo Varadkar, whose country failed to qualify for Russia after losing to Denmark in a play-off, told the BBC he wanted the Red Devils to win, not the Three Lions, on Thursday.Nigel Farage never misses an opportunity to fly the flag, or visit the pub, so it was no surprise to see pictures of him watching the England game at a Brussels bar.But when he draped himself in an England flag, handed to him by a friend, the Beer Factory bar, next door to the European Parliament, erupted in boos, according to The Daily Mirror. and European Parliament staff on a nearby table whipped out an EU flag.Then there is the generic ""come on England"" tweet, which seems straightforward enough, unless individual players are co-opted into the message.The Conservative Party's official Twitter account posted this just before the Belgium game:The two men pictured are Manchester United's Jesse Lingard, who scored against Panama, and Manchester City's Raheem Sterling.Jesse Lingard's political views are unknown. But three years ago, Raheem Sterling recorded a video pledging his support to Labour's Dawn Butler. Butler, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, was running to be re-elected as an MP in the part of North West London where Sterling grew up.The Labour leader is a football fan - he even presented EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier with an Arsenal shirt last year.But he was accused of making his own World Cup gaffe, sharing a quote by former Liverpool manager Bill Shankly ahead of England's game against Tunisia. As many on Twitter were quick to point out, Shankly was perhaps not the ideal person to provide pre-match inspiration for the England football team.The Scottish legend once said about playing for his country: ""It's fantastic. You look down at your dark blue shirt, and the wee lion looks up at you and says 'Get out after the English...!'""Some political World Cup slip-ups are a little more subtle. While the basic rules of football are familiar to just about everyone, using the wrong footballing phrase can give the game away.Conservative MP Nick Boles threw his support behind a campaign by the Sun newspaper to fly the St George's flag above government departments during England matches.But as any football fan will know, the World Cup ""play-offs"" are a series of matches to determine which teams qualify for the World Cup in the first place - not part of the actual tournament.The knockout phase in Russia - a series of matches between teams who came first or second in their groups, culminating in the World Cup final in Moscow on 15 July - is never referred to as the ""play-offs"".To be fair to Boles, he said his campaign was about reclaiming the flag and building a modern English identity rather than being about what's happening on on the pitch. Football is not his specialism, as he freely admitted in a 2014 tweet:The Sun's campaign was successful, and departments agreed to fly the St George's flag during matches.The Department for International Trade was so keen to draw attention to this that not only did they tweet about this, but they also emailed journalists to say that they had tweeted about this.The Labour Party also made a subtle linguistic slip-up in the run-up to the Belgium game.Jumping on the World Cup bandwagon to criticise Theresa May and her ministers, Labour tweeted that May's ""squad"" should be ""benched"". That might be something people would say in American sports commentary, but is not a phrase commonly heard in discussions about English football.But even if politicians' 2018 World Cup tweets are sometimes a bit clunky, they don't quite reach the heights of David Cameron's 2015 gaffe.In a speech during the election campaign the former prime minister mistakenly said he was a West Ham fan rather than an Aston Villa fan. He said he had gone ""off script"" with the remark and blamed it on a ""brain fade"", insisting ""I've been an Aston Villa fan all my life""."

But it's not just in the UK that this matters, because the Republic of Ireland depends on trade with the United Kingdom for its economic well-being. There's been a lot of talk about north-south trade across the border with Northern Ireland, and the need to avoid any border checks. But in purely economic terms, east-west trade across the Irish Sea between Ireland and Great Britain is far more important.   The vast majority of freight traffic leaving the Republic of Ireland is exported from Dublin, with the busiest routes to ports such as Liverpool and Holyhead.How much trade are we talking about? One way of measuring it is to look at the data on roll-on roll-off freight containers, many of them carrying food and other retail items that people rely on every day. Roll-on, roll-off (or Ro-Ro) refers to containers transported on lorries or trailers, while lift-on, lift-off (or Lo-Lo) refers to containers that are loaded on to ships by cranes. (And yes, Rolos are still made of chocolate.) Ro-Ro transport is important for produce that needs to get to market quickly, or for just-in-time manufacturing processes that rely on hourly deliveries of components. Ireland's Central Statistics Office released figures on 29 June, which show that in 2017 553,630 loaded Ro-Ro freight containers, on lorries or trailers, were shipped from Ireland to the rest of the world. The vast majority were heading for other ports in the EU. Only a tiny number - 24 - went to ports elsewhere. About 85% of Ireland's total EU freight trade goes via British ports - 475,925 containers last year. We can break that number down a bit further. The Irish Freight Transport Association estimates that the final destination of roughly 60% of the 475,925 freight containers shipped to Britain is Britain itself.That means the other 40% - roughly 190,000 per year - is destined for elsewhere in the EU, transiting across Britain via ports such as Dover or Hull, or via the Channel Tunnel. No-one knows the exact number, although Ireland's Department of Transport has commissioned in-depth research that should be released shortly. But one thing is clear: any kind of breakdown or problem posed by the failure to reach a Brexit agreement could have a huge impact, not just on Ireland's trade with the UK, but also on Ireland's trade with the rest of the EU. Don't forget that in this article we've just looked at Irish exports. Ireland is equally dependent on trade with the UK for its imports.Ireland currently sends lots of its exports to other countries via Britain because it is quicker than doing the whole journey by sea.Could Ireland try to cut out the so-called British land bridge and trade more directly with the rest of the EU? Some steps are already being taken in that direction.  One Luxembourg-based shipping company, CLdN, has just introduced two huge new Ro-Ro freight ferries on the direct sea route from Dublin to the Dutch port of Rotterdam, and to Zeebrugge in Belgium. The new ferries are the largest short-sea Ro-Ro vessels (ones that do not cross oceans) in the world, and can carry 650 cargo units on each voyage.When one of them, the MV Celine, was christened in Dublin in April, the chief executive of Dublin Port Company, Eamonn O'Reilly, said: ""The addition of new ships and sailings shows the shipping sector's resilience and ability to adapt to changing customer needs, particularly in response to Brexit.""""We expect MV Celine will mark the beginning of additional services to continental Europe from Dublin port over the coming years.""  Extra freight capacity is already being phased in on ferry routes between Dublin and Cherbourg, in France, as well as between Cork and Santander, in Spain.  But to give some idea of the extent to which Ireland relies on the British land bridge, statistics from the Port of Dublin show that last year it sent 31,875 loaded Ro-Ro containers to Belgium and Holland, while it sent 188,902 containers to Holyhead alone.So while some contingency plans are already being made, it's not nearly enough to replace the trade that currently goes to or through Britain. And that is a reminder that Ireland needs a good Brexit deal almost as much as the UK does. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

""The fragility of the EU is increasing,"" warns EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. ""The cracks are growing in size.""It's been easy to get distracted this last couple of weeks by the new Italian government and its headline-grabbing rejection of NGO migrant rescue boats. But Mr Juncker is right: EU fissures go deeper and are more widespread.Migration pits southern Europe against the north. Italy and Greece smoulder with resentment at having been left alone to deal with migrant arrivals. Meanwhile, northern countries blame the south for not patrolling their Mediterranean borders better and for having, at least in the past, enabled migrants to ""slip away"" northwards towards richer Germany, Austria and Sweden.Read more from Katya: EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics?Migration slashes the EU from east to west too.Newer member states from Central and Eastern Europe never signed up to the post World War Two ""all for one and one for all"" vision. When it comes to EU solidarity and burden-sharing, they are fervent non-believers. They determinedly turn their backs when Italy and Germany plead for migrant quotas.The number of migrants arriving illegally in Europe may be down, but so is voter tolerance of the problem.The rise and rise across the EU of tough-on-migration politicians has emboldened hardliners such as Hungary's Victor Orban and Austria's Sebastian Kurz, who takes over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU this Sunday and will push migration as a top priority.""Keep Them Out"" is Austria's main aim and while Europe's (still) most influential leader, Angela Merkel, arrives in Brussels on Thursday pushing - and praying - for compromise on burden-sharing and prevention, the number of EU leaders pushing single-mindedly on the migrant deterrence button is growing.Which brings me to the next layer of European splits provoked by migration: within national governments as well as between countries. Germany is the most dramatic example.Mrs Merkel has clearly been weakened at home by her previous open-door migrant policy. Formerly viewed as politically untouchable, the German chancellor has now been given an ultimatum by her own interior minister.""By the end of this Brussels summit, you need to come home with a workable pan-European solution to stop irregular migrants bleeding into Germany,"" Horst Seehofer has threatened her. ""Or I will unilaterally slam Germany's borders shut.""The Austrian government told me this week it would then immediately follow suit, causing a border-closing domino effect across Europe - with a seismic impact on the EU's prize political and economic project: the open-border Schengen agreement. What a blow for Brussels and nightmare for Europe's export-king Germany that would be. Of course we're not there yet.In true European Union style, once gathered round a table here in Brussels, there will undoubtedly be emphasis on what unites rather than divides member countries.On migration, EU leaders will easily agree to beef up their Frontex border guard. There's also growing convergence around the idea of setting up so-called disembarkation centres outside the EU to identify economic migrants, who in theory could be sent home. Those with a right to asylum or refugee status could then be given safe and legal passage to Europe.And there's much talk of closer co-operation (read: money) with migrant countries of origin and the transit countries (read: Libya and its coastguard) that migrants cross to make their way to people smuggler boats.But these ideas are easier to formulate than to carry out.You would need a lot of EU border guards to truly patrol southern Europe's thousands of miles of open coastline. You would need permission from African countries such as Niger and Chad to set up processing centres, for example. So far that's a distant goal.In the meantime, there is no whiff of EU agreement over what to do with migrants who do reach Europe.Which brings us back to the threat to Schengen.Gloomy German government sources told me they gave the project a three out of 10 chance of survival thanks to the increasingly nationalistic nature of many European governments.""And if Schengen does fail,"" they predict, ""that would be the beginning of the end of the European Union.""It's too early really to herald the demise of the EU or even the end of Mrs Merkel's career in government as a result of this very political migrant crisis in Europe.But, as EU summit host Donald Tusk said to EU leaders on the eve of their arrival: ""The stakes are very high. And time is short."""

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-02,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180701062522/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Here's what happened.Theresa May opened by paying tribute to Private Reece Miller who died while on operations in Estonia. He served the country with great distinction, she added. The PM went on to praise the dedication and hard work of NHS staff on its 70th birthday and in the final bit of her preamble she congratulated the England football team on their World Cup win on Tuesday night. Theresa May kicks off #PMQs by with a nod to ""a very rare and welcome event... the England football team winning a penalty shootout"" ⚽ https://t.co/YotVXtOgys pic.twitter.com/pfIrYSJ7AJEnd of Twitter post  by @BBCPoliticsLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn echoed the tributes to Pte Miller and the football team. On the NHS he said it should be properly funded and he added thanks for the work of the firefighters tackling the Saddleworth Moor fire. Turning to his questions, he attacked the PM over bus services:Corbyn notes rising bus fares, falling passenger numbers, and reduced services asking if the PM accepts failure ""on yet another public service."" #PMQs https://t.co/YotVXtOgys pic.twitter.com/a4bYSY5AXhEnd of Twitter post 2 by @BBCPoliticsMrs May responded by highlighting the extra funding being put into the NHS, before saying that people's working habits had been changing which had led to less use of buses around the country. She added that Mr Corbyn should ask local councils what they were doing about bus services.Mr Corbyn claimed 500 bus routes per year had been cut and asked if the prime minister thought ""bus services are a public responsibility or just something you leave to the market"".The prime minister picked up on Mr Corbyn's mention of lower-paid people being hit hardest when bus services were cut or fares increased. She said that the government was helping those people in a variety of ways, such as increasing the minimum wage.You wait ages for a bus question and a whole host came along at once - Mr Corbyn, sticking with his theme, said there were 26m fewer bus journeys across the north of England and the Midlands and he asked the PM if she thought deregulation of the buses had been a success or a failure.“A bus pass isn’t much use if there is not a bus” notes Corbyn 🤔 #PMQs https://t.co/YotVXtOgys pic.twitter.com/l0zq5yrYKuEnd of Twitter post 3 by @BBCPoliticsThe PM did not answer that question directly, instead noting that bus use in London had gone down since Labour's mayor was elected, and then, to cheers from her MPs, said the Conservative Mayor for the West Midlands had extended free bus travel to students and apprentices.""It will be a Labour government that saves the bus industry and a Labour government that gives free fares to under-26-year-olds,"" said Mr Corbyn, who also said private bus firms had made £3.3bn of profit since 2010. He asked why the government didn't give local authorities more powers over bus operators.Mrs May hit back saying she would take ""no lessons"" from Labour on devolution of powers to councils. And she ended with a now-almost-traditional listing of things the government had achieved - such as record employment as it builds a ""Britain fit for the future"".The SNP's Ian Blackford began by congratulating England on their World Cup victory - his party's calling of votes during the match last night annoyed some - before raising the issue of Vote Leave ""being expected to be found guilty of breaking electoral law"".Mrs May said she would not comment on a leaked report that the government had not yet seen. She said the government would consider it when it received it.

Mrs May said the Scottish Conservatives worked with the Electoral Commission to make sure donations are accepted and declared properly.

So did Jeremy Corbyn miss an opportunity to rub salt into open wounds, by talking about buses, not Brexit?The Westminster bubble always prefers to hear about its own concerns, but it is flat out wrong to be dismissive of the problems on the buses - and maybe the choice of question reflected his experience of trying to penetrate the PM's carefully phrased formulae on customs unions and immigration.But if Mr Corbyn didn't delve into Brexit, Brexiteers Owen Paterson and Sir Edward Leigh did attempt to drill down. Mr Patterson delivered a humorous-sounding question referencing President Macron's plan to hold performance reviews of his cabinet. But don't mistake the menace behind the genial grin. He was targeting ""soft Brexit"" cabinet ministers like the chancellor and the business secretary, to be sure, but he was also nailing the PM to her own election promises, and signalling that he wanted no retreat from them.Sir Edward followed up by seeking reassurance on key Brexiteer concerns about securing control of immigration, and allowing the UK to strike independent trade deals, unrestricted by the EU's single market rules. The PM assured him her red lines remained in place. It sounds reassuring, but were the questioners reassured? And I was also struck by the giggles produced by her assertion that she led a strong cabinet team - the opposition doesn't even bother to jeer such claims any more.The SNP Leader Ian Blackford had a predictably rough ride after his party forced divisions last night to keep MPs voting while the England-Colombia game was on. But he zeroed in on questions about political funding. Does this mark the opening of a parliamentary second front, attacking Brexit by attacking the legitimacy of the referendum verdict? One telling point is the way the noise level dropped as his question unfolded, and then redoubled as he continued. Maybe the hecklers recognised a threat. Then, the Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey was added to the list of under-fire Cabinet ministers when Labour's Marsha De Cordova raised the blistering rebuke she'd suffered from the Comptroller and Auditor General, the government's Wastefinder-General for misleading the House of Commons over the contents of his National Audit Office's report on the roll-out of the new super-benefit, Universal Credit. First, Marsha De Cordova skilfully avoided the procedural bear traps around accusations of this kind, when a false word could quite easily have resulted in the Speaker intervening, And then the PM responded by announcing that Esther McVey would apologise after question time - when she endured a brief noisy few minutes ""correcting the record"". Following her statement, the Labour Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, Frank Field, said he had applied for an urgent question, to be asked tomorrow, on the issue.So, to summarise, the PM navigated through some dangerous waters on Brexit, but the exchanges with her backbenchers had a rather rote and ritual feel. And the questions provided a reminder that Brexit is not the only issue; Sir Oliver Heald's hardline call for action on the crisis on the railways demonstrates the heat Tory MPs are taking from commuters, the implementation of Universal Credit touches millions of voters and Jeremy Corbyn's bus questions highlighted another public service problem. The PM was, as ever, well prepared and went on the attack where she could. But the overall impression was of problems crowding in from all quarters while the government wrestles with Brexit.

2018-07-03,Jaguar boss: Brexit threatens investment,https://web.archive.org//web/20180705034106/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44719656,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJaguar Land Rover has warned that a ""bad"" Brexit deal would threaten £80bn worth of investment plans for the UK and may force it to close factories. The UK's biggest carmaker, owned by India's Tata Motors, said its ""heart and soul is in the UK"".But without frictionless trade JLR said its UK investment plans would be in jeopardy.The warning came as Downing Street set out details of a possible post-Brexit customs arrangement.Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Ralf Speth said: ""A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than £1.2bn profit each year.""As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. We have spent around £50bn in the UK in the past five years - with plans for a further £80bn more in the next five.""This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.""Mr Speth said the firm urgently needs ""greater certainty"" to continue to investing heavily in the UK.He told the Financial Times: ""If I'm forced to go out because we don't have the right deal, then we have to close plants here in the UK and it will be very, very sad. This is hypothetical, and I hope it's an option we never have to go for.""Uncertainty over Brexit, as well as the future of diesel cars, has already led the carmaker to announce a series of changes to its UK business.At the beginning of the year, JLR said it would cut production at its plant in Halewood, Merseyside where it builds three of its Range Rover models.In April, it decided not to renew the contracts for 1,000 temporary workers in Solihull. Last month, JLR said it would shift production of the Land Rover Discovery SUV to Slovakia, potentially leading to some UK job losses.However, the carmaker also said that it was investing in its Solihull site to allow it to build its new Range Rover models, some of which will be electric-powered, from 2020.PB Balaji, chief financial officer at Tata Motors, said: ""Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Motors have always maintained that the uncertainties from Brexit are avoidable and the business seeks clarity to ensure that industry takes timely and right decisions to manage the transition.""Additionally, Jaguar Land Rover needs free and full access to the single market beyond transition to remain competitive which we also firmly believe is in the best long term interests of the United Kingdom.""The recent statement from JLR only reaffirms this position that a Brexit which increases bureaucracy, reduces productivity and competitiveness of the UK industry is in no-one's interest.""As well as Halewood and Solihull, JLR also has a manufacturing plant in Castle Bromwich, Birmingham where it makes its Jaguar cars.Last year, it made more than 600,000 cars, 20% of which were sold to mainland Europe, one of its biggest markets.JLR said that it spent £5.67bn with UK suppliers of production parts during its last financial year, as well as £5.37bn with EU-based businesses.Simon Jack, BBC business editorJLR may be Indian-owned, but its brand and - as the company puts it - its heart and soul is in the UK.It employs 40,000 people directly and 260,000 work in its supply chain. JLR's warning follows those of Airbus, BMW and Nissan who have all said further investment in the UK is ""under review"" and could be cancelled if the country leaves the EU without a deal that ensures frictionless trade. JLR insiders say £80bn worth of future investment in the UK over the next five years ""could be lost"".The intervention of such a major employer - which in many ways is rightly perceived as more British than the likes of BMW, Airbus and Nissan - will heap more pressure on the government ahead of a crunch meeting of government ministers on Friday. At this meeting, business hopes the government will finally settle on its own preferred version of the UK's future economic relationship with its largest market. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the government was ""determined"" to make sure JLR could ""continue to prosper and invest in Britain"".The Jaguar Land Rover warning follows similar statements from BMW and Airbus. However, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called these warnings ""completely inappropriate"".JLR is a great British success story. We are determined to make sure that it can continue to prosper and to invest in Britain. https://t.co/DQ5lSpM2obEnd of Twitter post  by @GregClarkMPMeanwhile, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has warned in a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier that failure to reach an agreement to ensure frictionless trade will  result in customs delays for perishable goods.

2018-07-03,Vote Leave campaign 'broke electoral law',https://web.archive.org//web/20180705034106/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44704561,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe official Brexit campaign is expected to be found guilty of four charges of breaking electoral law, the BBC has been told.The draft of an investigation into Vote Leave concludes it broke spending limits and failed to comply with some of the rules.It also imposes fines as a result of its findings.But the group's former chief executive claimed the Electoral Commission had not followed due process.Matthew Elliott has submitted a 500-page dossier to the Electoral Commission rebutting the claims.The commission said Vote Leave had taken the ""unusual step"" of going public having seen the draft report.According to Vote Leave's dossier, the commission finds the campaign group:Crucially, the draft report is said to claim there was coordination between Vote Leave and a smaller campaign, BeLeave, which received a donation of more than £600,000 in the closing weeks of the referendum, after advice from the Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings.For months there have been allegations that the two campaigns broke the rules by working together too closely. The electoral rules stipulate that different campaign groups can work loosely together but they must not have a ""common plan"". This has always been denied by the two groups and has been investigated twice already by the Electoral Commission.Vote Leave now admits there was email correspondence between a donor, Anthony Clake, and Mr Cummings about passing a donation on to BeLeave. It is understood that this third investigation concludes that there was a ""common plan"", and therefore the law was broken.A spokesperson for the Electoral Commission said: ""The commission has concluded its investigation and, having reached initial findings, provided Vote Leave with a 28-day period to make any further or new representations. That period ended on Tuesday 3 July.""The unusual step taken by Vote Leave in sharing its views on the Electoral Commission's initial findings does not affect the process set out in law.""It said it would give ""due considerations"" to representations it had received and then publish a ""thorough and detailed closing report in order to provide a full and balanced account"".Speaking to the BBC, Mr Elliott said the commission had ""listened to one side of the story"".""We offered to go in for interviews, both at board level and at staff level,"" he said.""They haven't accepted any interviews from our side.""Mr Elliott said he thought Vote Leave had ""acted both within the letter of the law and also the spirit of the law"", and that it was perfectly legitimate that they would ""work alongside other groups and encourage them and encourage their activities"".He denied that he was simply trying to deflect the coming criticism of the campaign.""We're saying 'can they look at our side of the story?''', he said, adding that they would take legal action to try to overturn the charges if they were not withdrawn.Tamsin Allen, the solicitor who represents the whistleblowers who went public with claims that Vote Leave broke the law, said: ""Vote Leave may not like this conclusion, but there is clearly a proper evidential basis for it.""The commission should be permitted to complete its work and we await the release of its final report.""One of the whistleblowers, Christopher Wylie, called for the referendum to be rerun, saying: ""If sanctions are issued against Vote Leave or their affiliates, this means the law was broken.""Another whistleblower, former Vote Leave activist Shahmir Sanni, said: ""I'm waiting for the report, but just for clarity, I told you so.""During Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said she would not comment on ""a leaked report"" after the matter was raised by the SNP.She added that the government would consider the final report and any recommendations.A spokesman for Anthony Clake, whose donation was given to BeLeave at the suggestion of Mr Cummings, said: ""Mr Clake was told by Mr Cummings that Vote Leave was reaching its spending limits, so he suggested that he could give it to BeLeave instead, which he did.""Any alleged collusion between the campaigns is a matter for them.""

We are relying on you. We know some of you want to be the future Party Leader. Please show your steel on Friday. @BorisJohnson @michaelgove @PennyMordaunt @LiamFox @andrealeadsom Chris GraylingEnd of Twitter post  by @andreajenkynsBut speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics, Mr Rees-Mogg hit out at suggestions the new arrangement could, in a bid to ensure smooth trading, involve a single market on goods with the EU and  close alignment with its regulations.Mr Rees-Mogg, who leads the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs, said this would be a ""really foolish policy"" and ""would not be a sensible way to run our economy after we've left the EU"", adding: ""I won't be reassured until I know the details of what comes out of Friday one way or the other.""In an attempt to address concerns, Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions the government would ensure ""we are out of the customs union, that we are out of the single market, that we are out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, we are out of the Common Agricultural Policy, we are out of the Common Fisheries Policy, we bring an end to free movement, we take control of our borders, we have an independent trade policy""."

The Ministry of Justice said court fees for council tax summons had been set too high since 2013-4 following an ""administrative error"".Councils had overpaid by about £9m a year since then, it said, and were entitled to be compensated in full.Officials said urgent action was due to cut fees to their correct level. Local authorities have to obtain Council Tax Liability Orders if they want to take legal action to recover unpaid tax from residents. Councils issued about 3.5 million summons for council tax arrears last year. Campaigners say this figure has risen sharply in recent years following the abolition of council tax benefit in 2013 and responsibility for providing support to people on low incomes passing to cash-strapped local authorities.Following a review of its fees system, the Ministry of Justice said it had discovered it had ""inadvertently"" over-charged £2.50 for each application over several years - a figure in excess of the legal costs involved in recovery.Details of how councils will be reimbursed will be outlined soon.The department would not comment on how large the final bill would be but said it would cost Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunal Service £9m in revenue in the current financial year.""Following a thorough review of fees across our courts and tribunals, we have identified a small number that have been charged incorrectly,"" a spokesman said.""We are taking urgent action to reduce those fees to their correct level and will set out details of a refund scheme as soon as possible.""It said the incorrect figures represented a ""fraction"" of the 300 separate fees charged for civil and family proceedings in magistrates and other courts in England.Total legal and other administration costs relating to council tax arrears totalled £292m in 2016-7, up £10m on the previous year.Council tax evasion and fraud costs the exchequer millions every year but campaigners have long urged a review of penalties for offenders and greater regulation of the use of bailiffs and other debt recovery firms.More than 4,800 people were taken to court and threatened with prison for not paying a council tax debt in 2016-17, the BBC reported last November, a rise of 11% on 2013. At least 62 people were imprisoned in England and Wales for council tax offences in 2016-17."
2018-07-03,UK 'to keep more of its fish' after Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180705034106/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44701010,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe fishing industry will get a larger share of domestic catch after Brexit once the UK ""decides access"" to its own waters, Michael Gove has insisted.The environment secretary said the UK would be in the ""driving seat"" in quota negotiations once the UK leaves the EU's Common Fisheries Policy but would not commit to a specific figure.At the moment, quotas are assigned to each country, with limits on species. UK fishing groups are pressing to keep more than 80% of domestic catch. The Scottish government said it had not been properly consulted about the UK's proposals for fishing after Brexit, unveiled on Wednesday, and had ""significant concerns"" about them. The UK says it gets a bad deal under current arrangements. In 2014, half of UK fish production was exported to the EU, a quarter to outside the EU and a quarter was consumed domestically.There were protests earlier this year when it was revealed that the UK would continue to be bound by the Common Fisheries Policy during the post-Brexit transition period which is due to run until the end of 2020.Ministers have urged the industry to keep their ""eyes on the prize"" of getting full control and have now published a White Paper setting out their vision for how they UK will do this as an ""independent coastal state"".Mr Gove told the BBC that from 2021 the UK would control fishing access to a 200 nautical mile ""exclusive economic zone"" around its coastline. While he would not be drawn on what share of catch the UK could keep in this area after Brexit, he said there was no reason the UK should be in a ""weaker position"" than Norway or Iceland - which retains 80% and 95% respectively of fish caught in their territorial waters.""Like other independent coastal states, we can decide who has access to our waters and we can ensure that a greater proportion of the fish in our waters is caught by British vessels, landed in British ports and processed by British producers,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today.While accepting there would still be annual negotiations over catch quotas in British waters, he said ""it will be a negotiation where we hold the cards and we are in the driving seat"". Mr Gove said market access for fish exports - which has yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU - would be treated separately from the question of access to each other's waters. The EU has previously suggested the two issues should be tied together.During a Commons debate on the plans, Conservative MP John Redwood said Brexit could be a fillip for the UK's 10,000 or so fish and chip shops.""Isn't it the case that we have a huge opportunity here to make sure that much more of the fish is landed by our boats in order to make sure that our traditional fish and chips is once again fish from our fishing grounds, properly looked after by a national policy?"" he said.But Labour warned of a gap between what Mr Gove hoped for and what he could deliver.""This white paper is full of optimism for the negotiations but the only deal so far agreed on fishing is we'll keep EU fishing policies during the transition period - and we're not holding our breath that this will all go according to plan,"" said shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman. Ministers have said they will publish an annual statement of fish stocks and work with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments, to whom fishing policy is devolved, to help any struggling stocks to recover as well as helping them to ""maximise their power to manage their fisheries"". But the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman Stephen Gethins said there was no mention in the report of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, which he said had been vital in helping coastal communities in Scotland and across the UK to diversify. ""There are a number of areas where we think there have been omissions,"" he told BBC News.""And half the fish landed are sold into European markets so there are concerns around what will happen with that valuable product.""Scottish Fishermen's Federation chief executive Bertie Armstrong - who has suggested the UK could emulate Norway and Iceland - urged ministers to show ""real backbone"" in the negotiations ahead.""At last we have a positive statement of taking back control of our waters and righting some of the wrongs that have been running for forty years,"" he said.Fishing featured prominently in the 2016 EU referendum campaign, with Leave campaigners saying the current rules encouraged overfishing and mismanaged stocks - and it led to one of the campaign's most memorable moments as Nigel Farage and Bob Geldof traded insults on boats during a protest on the Thames.UKIP's fishing spokesman Mike Hookem warned the industry would see little change under Mr Gove's plans. Gove's #FisheriesWhitePaper is nothing more than a smokescreen to maintain the CFP status quo! If the Minister thinks the UK industry will settle for a few extra fish, while a small minority walk away with the rest, he is kidding himself.

The Muslim Council of Britain recently complained that its own request for an inquiry had been ignored and accused the party of ""turning a blind eye"" to the issue.It has compiled a dossier listing Conservative councillors and candidates who have been suspended or expelled following allegations of anti-Muslim prejudice.It has voiced concern about the tone of Richmond Park MP Zac Goldsmith's 2016 campaign for the London mayoralty, and about social media messages shared by Harrow East MP Bob Blackman - who has strongly denied any allegation of anti-Muslim prejudice.In an article for the Guardian, Baroness Warsi - who was the UK's first female Muslim cabinet minister - said both Mr Goldsmith and Mr Blackman should receive ""mandatory enrolment"" on diversity training courses.The Conservatives' promise of voluntary courses for those who wanted them was ""not enough"", she said, warning the party needed to be ""proactive and change its culture"".The peer said she had written to Theresa May about the issue and submitted a dossier of evidence but ""absolutely nothing tangible"" had happened in response.The time for an internal investigation had passed, she said, and only a ""forensic, wide-ranging and transparent inquiry"" would now suffice. The Conservatives say any members found to have behaved inappropriately have been suspended and investigations launched. "

""However, media statements soon indicated the negotiations were being undermined,"" he said. ""So we must park the proposal for the time being and revert to established procedure.""Mr Price added: ""We cannot put off the irresistible call for defining change.  ""Change in the way we frame our politics; the projection of who we are, what we stand for, what we have fought long and hard for and what's ultimately important to us.""Mr ap Iorwerth was the first to launch his campaign, via a social media video on Wednesday, saying Ms Wood had invited a debate on the leadership and that supporters and party members across Wales had ""encouraged me to allow my name to go forward"". He said: ""That encouragement has come from people at all elected levels, but mainly from ordinary party members, including some who, I'm quite sure, will back Leanne!""Mr ap Iorwerth said he was accepting the nominations in the spirit of a ""constructive debate"" that can ""energise the party and the country"".""My commitment is to Wales, and to a fairer and more prosperous future for the country,"" he said. ""Plaid Cymru has to lead the way to that new, confident Wales"".Something has not been connecting for Plaid - we have not seen the electoral earthquake predicted by Adam Price, the tectonic plates haven't shifted to any degree.That has led to a growing sense of malaise in the Plaid Cymru assembly group. Some wanted Leanne Wood to move away from niche issues, others think the only way to power is to extend a hand to the Tories. It just became apparent that people wanted different things and the leader couldn't accommodate.My sense is that both rival candidates would rather it hadn't come to this. Plaid's pivotal momentBefore joining the assembly, Mr ap Iorwerth was a reporter and presenter for BBC Wales, and presented Newyddion 9 on S4C.He became an AM in a by-election in 2013, succeeding former Plaid leader Ieuan Wyn Jones who stepped down from the assembly to run a science park.Earlier in June Mr ap Iorwerth told a press conference that he had ""no plans and neither does anyone else have plans to put their name forward in that particular window"".Mr Price was an MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr from 2001 to 2010. An attempt he and other MPs made to impeach Tony Blair over the Iraq War in 2004 failed.After voluntarily leaving the Commons in 2010 he embarked on a Fulbright scholarship at Harvard University.  He was elected to the Welsh Assembly in 2016, once again representing Carmarthen East and Dinefwr."

Here is a guide to the ""who, why, and when"".Why is there a contest? Carwyn Jones shocked the Welsh Labour conference in April when he announced he would step down as their leader and first minister at the end of the year.  He said he had been through ""the darkest of times"" - a reference to the death last November of Carl Sargeant, four days after Mr Jones sacked him as communities secretary. Who is in the running?Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford was first to declare, with backing from more than the minimum five AMs needed for the nomination.   Vaughan Gething, Eluned Morgan and Huw Irranca-Davies have also said they want to stand but unless the rules change on nominations not all of them will get onto the ballot paper.When will the winner be named?Welsh Labour will hold a special conference in September to decide the rules of the contest, amid debate over whether it should be one member one vote (OMOV) or an electoral college which gives more weight to the views of MPs, AMs and organisations such as trade unions.   The result is expected around early December, nine years to the month that Carwyn Jones took over from Rhodri Morgan.Why is there a contest?Neil Hamilton was ousted as leader of the five-strong UKIP group in May by Caroline Jones, who promised a more collaborative approach to Senedd politics.  The former Tory MP vowed to regain the group leadership, prompting UKIP HQ in London to step in and order a ballot of UKIP members in Wales to settle the row.Who is in the running?Neil Hamilton and Caroline Jones have both declared their intention to stand, along with Gareth Bennett, who has vowed to campaign to abolish the assembly.When will the winner be named?UKIP has said it expects to announce the result of the membership ballot by the end of July.Why is there a contest?Andrew RT Davies quit the leadership last Wednesday feeling he had lost the support of his colleagues.  He had been condemned within the party the previous Friday for accusing firms such as Airbus of undermining Brexit by voicing their concerns about the impact on trade.    But the ardent supporter of Brexit later told BBC Wales he had been aware of moves to unseat him for some time. Who is in the running?Interim leader Paul Davies has said he would like the job on a permanent basis, and Suzy Davies has also put her name forward.  While both backed Remain in the 2016 referendum on Europe, former Welsh Secretary David Jones has said the next assembly group leader should reflect what he called the ""overwhelmingly Eurosceptic"" views of grassroots members in Wales.When will the winner be named?A postal ballot of Welsh Conservative members will take place in August, and the result declared on 6 September. Why is there a contest?Plaid rules allow for a leadership contest every two years, and the window for a challenge closed on Wednesday.  Despite Leanne Wood's high profile in TV election debates in recent years, there has been unhappiness within party ranks at the apparent lack of progress in terms of AMs and MPs elected.   In June Ms Wood said she would welcome a contest and felt ""very"" confident of winning it.Who is in the running?Earlier in June Rhun ap Iorwerth said he had ""no plans"" to challenge Ms Wood, but has announced a bid saying she had invited a debate on Plaid's leadership and supporters had urged him to stand.  On Monday, Adam Price called on Ms Wood to share the leadership with a man to boost Plaid's fortunes or face the prospect of a challenge.  She turned the proposal down and Mr Price has now thrown his hat into the ring too.When will the winner be named?Plaid Cymru says it will announce a timetable shortly.The Welsh Lib Dems had a leadership election last November, when Jane Dodds beat Elizabeth Evans in a vote of the membership.   She took over from Mark Williams, the last remaining Welsh Lib Dem MP who stepped down after losing his Ceredigion seat at the 2017 general election.   With the sole Lib Dem AM Kirsty Williams serving in the Welsh Government as education secretary, the party changed its rules which previously said the Welsh leader had to be an AM or MP.    "
2018-07-03,Hard or soft?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180705034106/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44532288,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA ""make-or-break"" meeting on the UK's future relationship with the European Union will be held by ministers this week. Have the voters they represent been able to decide what kind of Brexit they want?Two years after the UK narrowly voted to leave the European Union, ministers are working towards the withdrawal deadline of 29 March 2019 - despite reports that they are divided over what Brexit should look like.The debate - which has also seen arguments about whether there should be referendum on a final deal - is often presented as a choice between so-called ""hard"" and ""soft"" Brexit. These terms mean different things to different people - but a ""hard"" Brexit is generally taken to mean a significant change, with the UK leaving the EU single market and customs union, and no longer implementing EU freedom of movement rules.""Soft"" Brexit is often used to describe the UK keeping some kind of free trade arrangement with the EU, remaining in a customs union and allowing EU citizens to live and work in the UK. But where do the UK's voters, who remain more or less evenly divided on whether they support leaving the EU, stand on what the future relationship should be like post-Brexit? Please upgrade your browserTwo polling companies, Opinium and ORB International, have been tracking this issue since the referendum. The wording of their questions is important.Opinium asked voters: ""If it becomes apparent that we will not be able to have one without the other, which of the following should be the government's negotiating priority during the Brexit negotiations?  Staying in the single market even if it means allowing free movement of labour, or ending free movement of labour even if it means we leave the single market?""The first option refers to a ""soft"" Brexit, the second to a ""hard"" one.The graph below shows the average percentage choosing each answer at four key points since January 2017.Three things stand out. First, many voters find answering this question difficult - about a quarter continue to say they are not sure which would be the better choice. It may be some are struggling with what is meant by ""the single market"" or ""free movement"", while others would perhaps like to be able to do both.Second, there is no clear majority in favour of either option. Third, there seems to have been a slight - but only slight - tilt in favour of staying in the single market rather than ending free movement. The four-point advantage for staying in the single market contrasts with a five-point lead for ending free movement in a couple of polls that Opinium conducted in early 2017. But this is just one question from one company. And all pollsters know the answer they get often depends on how the question is posed. ORB has taken a different approach.Every month since November 2016, it has asked people to agree or disagree with the following proposition: ""Having greater control over immigration ['hard Brexit'] is more important than having access to free trade with the EU ['soft Brexit']."" The graph shows the average for all the polls conducted in five time periods.Voters evidently find ORB's question easier to answer, though as many as 15% still stay they don't know. Among those who do answer, slightly more say they back a hard Brexit - that is, they agree that controlling immigration is more important than free trade with the EU. There is no consistent evidence that this picture has changed during the past two years.However, ORB's data confirms Opinium's suggestion that the UK is split in its views about the kind of Brexit it would like to see.This is perhaps not surprising given that the country is still more or less evenly divided between Remain and Leave.In its recent polls, Opinium has found that, on average, about two-thirds of Remain voters (68%) prioritise staying in the single market, while three-fifths of Leave supporters (61%) feel it is more important to end free movement. The balance of opinion among Conservative and Labour supporters is rather different too. According to Opinium, 40% of Conservative supporters would prioritise ending free movement and only 20% staying in the single market. But among Labour supporters, the equivalent figures are 11% and 45% respectively. Some of the demographic divisions revealed by the 2016 referendum are repeated in the hard-v-soft debate too. ORB's recent polls suggest only 26% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 35% of 25- to 34-year-olds agree it is more important to control immigration than to secure access to free trade with the EU. In contrast, most of those aged 65 or over (56%) and 55- to 64-year-olds (53%) hold that view.Meanwhile, women (38%) are much more likely than men (16%) to say they are not sure whether the UK should stay in the single market, or end free movement.Another aspect of the hard-v-soft debate on which polling has been relatively scarce is whether or not the UK should stay in a customs union with the EU. But in the past couple of months, Opinium has asked people if they've heard about a customs union, and whether the government should try to stay in the EU customs union in order to prioritise EU trade or to leave it to allow the UK to grow its trade links with the rest of the world. On both occasions, more than a fifth said they had not heard of the customs union at all, while 16-17% said they didn't know what the government's priority should be. So, despite the heated debate the issue has recently generated at Westminster, it appears to have passed many voters by. Among those with a preference, public opinion is again more or less evenly divided, with 31-32% arguing the UK should stay in the customs union and 30% disagreeing. How Sweden is preparing for Russia to hack its electionLocal election results 2018: How important was the Brexit effect?Why politicians often row about taxThe six tribes that could shape Europe's futureSo, however the issue is addressed, two points stand out about public attitudes towards Brexit. First, many voters are not at all sure about what kind of Brexit they would like. Second, among those who do have a view, opinion is more or less evenly divided. This makes it very difficult for any politician to be sure how best to interpret the ""will of the people"" as expressed in the EU referendum. But that is the challenge that they face as the Brexit negotiations now move up a gear.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.John Curtice is professor of politics at Strathclyde University and research fellow at the NatCen Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.He is also chief commentator at WhatUKthinks.org.Edited by Jennifer Clarke"

2018-07-03,New customs plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20180705034106/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44694861,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSo, finally, Theresa May has found a way. Not to get Brexit over the finishing line, obviously. But at least out of the starting block. Or so she hopes.Not to unite the Cabinet. No-one could do that. But at least to herd most of them into line behind her. Or so she hopes.And if one or two can't or won't get with the programme - there's the door.The door, of course, being the door of Chequers, her country retreat, where she'll gather her Cabinet again on Friday and try - very hard, apparently - to get agreement on her plan for a negotiating position which might, just might, fly in Brussels.How, though? Theresa May's ""red-lines"" always look and sound very red and very clear. They did again yesterday in the Commons when she pledged Britain to leave the EU, the customs union and the single market. That, I'm now told by well placed sources, is still the plan. Sort of. Only the so-called ""third option"" for Britain's future customs relationship with the EU looks much like an amalgam of the two which ran into a Cabinet road block - and on close examination more like the close ""customs partnership"", which Mrs May came to prefer, than any other. Not that it's being sold to Brexiteers like that. And there is a lot in the new plan that might appeal, as it must, to the Brexiteer gallery.So what's the big idea?A single market trade deal on goods is the vital component. Business will probably like that, as far as it goes. Though, it won't be called a single market because that sounds too aligned to Brussels. Agri-food trade would be part of that deal too. It has to be to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - which is vital if Brexit talks in Brussels are to get anywhere at all.What then of services? And financial services? The Cabinet is split. Business Secretary Greg Clark's not alone in wanting a single market deal - or whatever it's called - to include services. But that's not, I gather, the plan. City firms saw this coming, and are saying again today they want in. But Theresa May's way is to make them wait during the Brexit transition while negotiations go on. The City is undoubtedly concerned about the impact of Brexit, particularly the risk of a ""hard Brexit"" and negotiations ending in no deal at all. Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, expressed the same concerns last week.But the fact is you don't need a single services market to avoid a hard Irish border. There is still time to negotiate the nature and degree of alignment between the UK and the EU.Theresa May will stick to her red lines. Only they'll soon start to look a little blurred. No customs union, at least as it's defined now. No customs checks, or tariffs on goods either, but Britain would apply EU level tariffs, except where the UK can seek and sign trade deals beyond Europe (leave aside, for a moment, the view of much derided ""experts"" that outside trade deals will be low value or, in the case of America, say, tough on the UK and dependent on deregulation - and not just of chlorinated chicken). Where UK tariffs are lower than the EU's there'd be refunds.The European Court of Justice has been a huge sticking point. May's solution, I'm told, envisages some middle way; some some form of trade arbitration that ultimately, in some way, recognises, the court's authority. And as for the big deep red line of freedom of movement of people. There's room for some concession here too, in the name of ""labour mobility"". It's been thought that Home Secretary Sajid Javid is against preferential access for EU citizens. But I'm hearing he may be open to the idea if it's part of a decent trade deal.So, will the Cabinet Brexiteers and sceptics buy it? That's the prime minister's big gamble. Some in government suspect she may duck a decisive confrontation even now. But assuming she's up for it: Boris must decide whether to work with her, and fight his corner on the inside, or walk and pursue his private interests, somehow becoming Britain's next prime minister conceivably somewhere on the list. Brexit Secretary David Davis? Hard to know. But he sees his job as a contribution to history and won't, surely, want to give it up if he can avoid it. His hopes of becoming PM may, like Boris Johnson's, have taken a knock. But then the list of Tories who want to be prime minister is now almost as long as the list of those who don't.The Tory MPs' shop steward, the Chairman of the Tory 1922 Committee of MPs, Sir Graham Brady has been appealing for order and loyalty in the weekend papers, and recently in a BBC interview. That's the sort of thing chairmen - and chairwomen if there ever is one - of the ""22"" are meant to say. But remember Graham Brady is also a passionate Brexiteer. He was being helpful to Mrs May.There's a plan then. There are still lots of blanks to wrangle over at Chequers before it can be slotted into the gaps in the coming policy Brexit White Paper, and that won't be settled quickly or easily. It's a test of the prime minister's nerve, and the willingness of her Cabinet colleagues to cause trouble.Brussels won't like much or any of it very much. They will likely fear leaving a Britain-shaped hole in the borders of the EU single market. They won't like the ""cherry picking"" of the rules which govern single market or customs union membership - however you may choose to describe those arrangements.Plans, even definitive plans, can change and often do. But at least there is a plan. And that's something. What could go wrong now? Apart from everything."

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-03,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180705034106/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

Here's what happened.Theresa May opened by paying tribute to Private Reece Miller who died while on operations in Estonia. He served the country with great distinction, she added. The PM went on to praise the dedication and hard work of NHS staff on its 70th birthday and in the final bit of her preamble she congratulated the England football team on their World Cup win on Tuesday night.

On the NHS he said it should be properly funded and he added thanks for the work of the firefighters tackling the Saddleworth Moor fire. Turning to his questions, he attacked the PM over bus services:Corbyn notes rising bus fares, falling passenger numbers, and reduced services asking if the PM accepts failure ""on yet another public service."" #PMQs https://t.co/YotVXtOgys pic.twitter.com/a4bYSY5AXhEnd of Twitter post 2 by @BBCPoliticsMrs May responded by highlighting the extra funding being put into the NHS, before saying that people's working habits had been changing which had led to less use of buses around the country. She added that Mr Corbyn should ask local councils what they were doing about bus services.Mr Corbyn claimed 500 bus routes per year had been cut and asked if the prime minister thought ""bus services are a public responsibility or just something you leave to the market"".The prime minister picked up on Mr Corbyn's mention of lower-paid people being hit hardest when bus services were cut or fares increased. She said that the government was helping those people in a variety of ways, such as increasing the minimum wage.You wait ages for a bus question and a whole host came along at once - Mr Corbyn, sticking with his theme, said there were 26m fewer bus journeys across the north of England and the Midlands and he asked the PM if she thought deregulation of the buses had been a success or a failure.“A bus pass isn’t much use if there is not a bus” notes Corbyn 🤔 #PMQs https://t.co/YotVXtOgys pic.twitter.com/l0zq5yrYKuEnd of Twitter post 3 by @BBCPoliticsThe PM did not answer that question directly, instead noting that bus use in London had gone down since Labour's mayor was elected, and then, to cheers from her MPs, said the Conservative Mayor for the West Midlands had extended free bus travel to students and apprentices.""It will be a Labour government that saves the bus industry and a Labour government that gives free fares to under-26-year-olds,"" said Mr Corbyn, who also said private bus firms had made £3.3bn of profit since 2010. He asked why the government didn't give local authorities more powers over bus operators.Mrs May hit back saying she would take ""no lessons"" from Labour on devolution of powers to councils. And she ended with a now-almost-traditional listing of things the government had achieved - such as record employment as it builds a ""Britain fit for the future"".The SNP's Ian Blackford began by congratulating England on their World Cup victory - his party's calling of votes during the match last night annoyed some - before raising the issue of Vote Leave ""being expected to be found guilty of breaking electoral law"".Mrs May said she would not comment on a leaked report that the government had not yet seen. She said the government would consider it when it received it. (you can read the BBC story on it here)She then said all donations to the Scottish Conservatives were accepted and declared in accordance with the law after Mr Blackford accused the party of ""systematically shielding donations from public scrutiny"".Referring to reports on the Ferret website, he alleged the Scottish Conservatives had received £319,000 from the Scottish Unionist Association Trust and said there was no information about who manages the trust, who its donors are or its assets.He urged the prime minister to reveal what checks had taken place before the money was accepted and for an investigation. Mrs May said the Scottish Conservatives worked with the Electoral Commission to make sure donations are accepted and declared properly. (you can read more about this issue here)Labour MP Stephen Pound had a light hearted build-up to asking the PM if she would pay more tax to help fund the NHS:“I recognise that the NHS is held in rather higher esteem in the nation than I am… we both need a bit of care and attention,” jokes Stephen Pound MP, who shares his birthday with #NHS70 #PMQs https://t.co/w7ln1kL0TF pic.twitter.com/XkZSVtfUxgEnd of Twitter post 4 by @BBCPoliticsLabour's Roberta Blackman-Woods brought up the forthcoming trip to the UK for President Donald Trump.There was more transport focus from Conservative MP Sir Oliver Heald:Could #Govia Thameslink be stripped of its franchise after ""unacceptable"" service?

So did Jeremy Corbyn miss an opportunity to rub salt into open wounds, by talking about buses, not Brexit?The Westminster bubble always prefers to hear about its own concerns, but it is flat out wrong to be dismissive of the problems on the buses - and maybe the choice of question reflected his experience of trying to penetrate the PM's carefully phrased formulae on customs unions and immigration.But if Mr Corbyn didn't delve into Brexit, Brexiteers Owen Paterson and Sir Edward Leigh did attempt to drill down. Mr Patterson delivered a humorous-sounding question referencing President Macron's plan to hold performance reviews of his cabinet. But don't mistake the menace behind the genial grin. He was targeting ""soft Brexit"" cabinet ministers like the chancellor and the business secretary, to be sure, but he was also nailing the PM to her own election promises, and signalling that he wanted no retreat from them.Sir Edward followed up by seeking reassurance on key Brexiteer concerns about securing control of immigration, and allowing the UK to strike independent trade deals, unrestricted by the EU's single market rules. The PM assured him her red lines remained in place. It sounds reassuring, but were the questioners reassured? And I was also struck by the giggles produced by her assertion that she led a strong cabinet team - the opposition doesn't even bother to jeer such claims any more.The SNP Leader Ian Blackford had a predictably rough ride after his party forced divisions last night to keep MPs voting while the England-Colombia game was on. But he zeroed in on questions about political funding. Does this mark the opening of a parliamentary second front, attacking Brexit by attacking the legitimacy of the referendum verdict? One telling point is the way the noise level dropped as his question unfolded, and then redoubled as he continued. Maybe the hecklers recognised a threat. Then, the Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey was added to the list of under-fire Cabinet ministers when Labour's Marsha De Cordova raised the blistering rebuke she'd suffered from the Comptroller and Auditor General, the government's Wastefinder-General for misleading the House of Commons over the contents of his National Audit Office's report on the roll-out of the new super-benefit, Universal Credit. First, Marsha De Cordova skilfully avoided the procedural bear traps around accusations of this kind, when a false word could quite easily have resulted in the Speaker intervening, And then the PM responded by announcing that Esther McVey would apologise after question time - when she endured a brief noisy few minutes ""correcting the record"". Following her statement, the Labour Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, Frank Field, said he had applied for an urgent question, to be asked tomorrow, on the issue.So, to summarise, the PM navigated through some dangerous waters on Brexit, but the exchanges with her backbenchers had a rather rote and ritual feel. And the questions provided a reminder that Brexit is not the only issue; Sir Oliver Heald's hardline call for action on the crisis on the railways demonstrates the heat Tory MPs are taking from commuters, the implementation of Universal Credit touches millions of voters and Jeremy Corbyn's bus questions highlighted another public service problem. The PM was, as ever, well prepared and went on the attack where she could. But the overall impression was of problems crowding in from all quarters while the government wrestles with Brexit.

2018-07-04,Jaguar boss: Brexit threatens investment,https://web.archive.org//web/20180705034106/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44719656,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJaguar Land Rover has warned that a ""bad"" Brexit deal would threaten £80bn worth of investment plans for the UK and may force it to close factories. The UK's biggest carmaker, owned by India's Tata Motors, said its ""heart and soul is in the UK"".But without frictionless trade JLR said its UK investment plans would be in jeopardy.The warning came as Downing Street set out details of a possible post-Brexit customs arrangement.Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Ralf Speth said: ""A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than £1.2bn profit each year.""As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. We have spent around £50bn in the UK in the past five years - with plans for a further £80bn more in the next five.""This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.""Mr Speth said the firm urgently needs ""greater certainty"" to continue to investing heavily in the UK.He told the Financial Times: ""If I'm forced to go out because we don't have the right deal, then we have to close plants here in the UK and it will be very, very sad. This is hypothetical, and I hope it's an option we never have to go for.""Uncertainty over Brexit, as well as the future of diesel cars, has already led the carmaker to announce a series of changes to its UK business.At the beginning of the year, JLR said it would cut production at its plant in Halewood, Merseyside where it builds three of its Range Rover models.In April, it decided not to renew the contracts for 1,000 temporary workers in Solihull. Last month, JLR said it would shift production of the Land Rover Discovery SUV to Slovakia, potentially leading to some UK job losses.However, the carmaker also said that it was investing in its Solihull site to allow it to build its new Range Rover models, some of which will be electric-powered, from 2020.PB Balaji, chief financial officer at Tata Motors, said: ""Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Motors have always maintained that the uncertainties from Brexit are avoidable and the business seeks clarity to ensure that industry takes timely and right decisions to manage the transition.""Additionally, Jaguar Land Rover needs free and full access to the single market beyond transition to remain competitive which we also firmly believe is in the best long term interests of the United Kingdom.""The recent statement from JLR only reaffirms this position that a Brexit which increases bureaucracy, reduces productivity and competitiveness of the UK industry is in no-one's interest.""As well as Halewood and Solihull, JLR also has a manufacturing plant in Castle Bromwich, Birmingham where it makes its Jaguar cars.Last year, it made more than 600,000 cars, 20% of which were sold to mainland Europe, one of its biggest markets.JLR said that it spent £5.67bn with UK suppliers of production parts during its last financial year, as well as £5.37bn with EU-based businesses.Simon Jack, BBC business editorJLR may be Indian-owned, but its brand and - as the company puts it - its heart and soul is in the UK.It employs 40,000 people directly and 260,000 work in its supply chain. JLR's warning follows those of Airbus, BMW and Nissan who have all said further investment in the UK is ""under review"" and could be cancelled if the country leaves the EU without a deal that ensures frictionless trade. JLR insiders say £80bn worth of future investment in the UK over the next five years ""could be lost"".The intervention of such a major employer - which in many ways is rightly perceived as more British than the likes of BMW, Airbus and Nissan - will heap more pressure on the government ahead of a crunch meeting of government ministers on Friday. At this meeting, business hopes the government will finally settle on its own preferred version of the UK's future economic relationship with its largest market. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the government was ""determined"" to make sure JLR could ""continue to prosper and invest in Britain"".The Jaguar Land Rover warning follows similar statements from BMW and Airbus. However, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called these warnings ""completely inappropriate"".JLR is a great British success story. We are determined to make sure that it can continue to prosper and to invest in Britain. https://t.co/DQ5lSpM2obEnd of Twitter post  by @GregClarkMPMeanwhile, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has warned in a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier that failure to reach an agreement to ensure frictionless trade will  result in customs delays for perishable goods. The BRC says that a third of the food consumed in the UK is imported from the EU."
2018-07-04,Vote Leave campaign 'broke electoral law',https://web.archive.org//web/20180705034106/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44704561,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe official Brexit campaign is expected to be found guilty of four charges of breaking electoral law, the BBC has been told.The draft of an investigation into Vote Leave concludes it broke spending limits and failed to comply with some of the rules.It also imposes fines as a result of its findings.But the group's former chief executive claimed the Electoral Commission had not followed due process.Matthew Elliott has submitted a 500-page dossier to the Electoral Commission rebutting the claims.The commission said Vote Leave had taken the ""unusual step"" of going public having seen the draft report.According to Vote Leave's dossier, the commission finds the campaign group:Crucially, the draft report is said to claim there was coordination between Vote Leave and a smaller campaign, BeLeave, which received a donation of more than £600,000 in the closing weeks of the referendum, after advice from the Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings.For months there have been allegations that the two campaigns broke the rules by working together too closely. The electoral rules stipulate that different campaign groups can work loosely together but they must not have a ""common plan"". This has always been denied by the two groups and has been investigated twice already by the Electoral Commission.Vote Leave now admits there was email correspondence between a donor, Anthony Clake, and Mr Cummings about passing a donation on to BeLeave. It is understood that this third investigation concludes that there was a ""common plan"", and therefore the law was broken.A spokesperson for the Electoral Commission said: ""The commission has concluded its investigation and, having reached initial findings, provided Vote Leave with a 28-day period to make any further or new representations. That period ended on Tuesday 3 July.""The unusual step taken by Vote Leave in sharing its views on the Electoral Commission's initial findings does not affect the process set out in law.""It said it would give ""due considerations"" to representations it had received and then publish a ""thorough and detailed closing report in order to provide a full and balanced account"".Speaking to the BBC, Mr Elliott said the commission had ""listened to one side of the story"".""We offered to go in for interviews, both at board level and at staff level,"" he said.""They haven't accepted any interviews from our side.""Mr Elliott said he thought Vote Leave had ""acted both within the letter of the law and also the spirit of the law"", and that it was perfectly legitimate that they would ""work alongside other groups and encourage them and encourage their activities"".He denied that he was simply trying to deflect the coming criticism of the campaign.""We're saying 'can they look at our side of the story?''', he said, adding that they would take legal action to try to overturn the charges if they were not withdrawn.Tamsin Allen, the solicitor who represents the whistleblowers who went public with claims that Vote Leave broke the law, said: ""Vote Leave may not like this conclusion, but there is clearly a proper evidential basis for it.""The commission should be permitted to complete its work and we await the release of its final report.""One of the whistleblowers, Christopher Wylie, called for the referendum to be rerun, saying: ""If sanctions are issued against Vote Leave or their affiliates, this means the law was broken.""Another whistleblower, former Vote Leave activist Shahmir Sanni, said: ""I'm waiting for the report, but just for clarity, I told you so.""During Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said she would not comment on ""a leaked report"" after the matter was raised by the SNP.She added that the government would consider the final report and any recommendations.A spokesman for Anthony Clake, whose donation was given to BeLeave at the suggestion of Mr Cummings, said: ""Mr Clake was told by Mr Cummings that Vote Leave was reaching its spending limits, so he suggested that he could give it to BeLeave instead, which he did.""Any alleged collusion between the campaigns is a matter for them.""

We are relying on you. We know some of you want to be the future Party Leader. Please show your steel on Friday. @BorisJohnson @michaelgove @PennyMordaunt @LiamFox @andrealeadsom Chris GraylingEnd of Twitter post  by @andreajenkynsBut speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics, Mr Rees-Mogg hit out at suggestions the new arrangement could, in a bid to ensure smooth trading, involve a single market on goods with the EU and  close alignment with its regulations.Mr Rees-Mogg, who leads the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs, said this would be a ""really foolish policy"" and ""would not be a sensible way to run our economy after we've left the EU"", adding: ""I won't be reassured until I know the details of what comes out of Friday one way or the other.""In an attempt to address concerns, Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions the government would ensure ""we are out of the customs union, that we are out of the single market, that we are out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, we are out of the Common Agricultural Policy, we are out of the Common Fisheries Policy, we bring an end to free movement, we take control of our borders, we have an independent trade policy""."

The Ministry of Justice said court fees for council tax summons had been set too high since 2013-4 following an ""administrative error"".Councils had overpaid by about £9m a year since then, it said, and were entitled to be compensated in full.Officials said urgent action was due to cut fees to their correct level. Local authorities have to obtain Council Tax Liability Orders if they want to take legal action to recover unpaid tax from residents. Councils issued about 3.5 million summons for council tax arrears last year. Campaigners say this figure has risen sharply in recent years following the abolition of council tax benefit in 2013 and responsibility for providing support to people on low incomes passing to cash-strapped local authorities.Following a review of its fees system, the Ministry of Justice said it had discovered it had ""inadvertently"" over-charged £2.50 for each application over several years - a figure in excess of the legal costs involved in recovery.Details of how councils will be reimbursed will be outlined soon.The department would not comment on how large the final bill would be but said it would cost Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunal Service £9m in revenue in the current financial year.""Following a thorough review of fees across our courts and tribunals, we have identified a small number that have been charged incorrectly,"" a spokesman said.""We are taking urgent action to reduce those fees to their correct level and will set out details of a refund scheme as soon as possible.""It said the incorrect figures represented a ""fraction"" of the 300 separate fees charged for civil and family proceedings in magistrates and other courts in England.Total legal and other administration costs relating to council tax arrears totalled £292m in 2016-7, up £10m on the previous year.Council tax evasion and fraud costs the exchequer millions every year but campaigners have long urged a review of penalties for offenders and greater regulation of the use of bailiffs and other debt recovery firms.More than 4,800 people were taken to court and threatened with prison for not paying a council tax debt in 2016-17, the BBC reported last November, a rise of 11% on 2013. At least 62 people were imprisoned in England and Wales for council tax offences in 2016-17."
2018-07-04,UK 'to keep more of its fish' after Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180705034106/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44701010,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe fishing industry will get a larger share of domestic catch after Brexit once the UK ""decides access"" to its own waters, Michael Gove has insisted.The environment secretary said the UK would be in the ""driving seat"" in quota negotiations once the UK leaves the EU's Common Fisheries Policy but would not commit to a specific figure.At the moment, quotas are assigned to each country, with limits on species. UK fishing groups are pressing to keep more than 80% of domestic catch. The Scottish government said it had not been properly consulted about the UK's proposals for fishing after Brexit, unveiled on Wednesday, and had ""significant concerns"" about them. The UK says it gets a bad deal under current arrangements. In 2014, half of UK fish production was exported to the EU, a quarter to outside the EU and a quarter was consumed domestically.There were protests earlier this year when it was revealed that the UK would continue to be bound by the Common Fisheries Policy during the post-Brexit transition period which is due to run until the end of 2020.Ministers have urged the industry to keep their ""eyes on the prize"" of getting full control and have now published a White Paper setting out their vision for how they UK will do this as an ""independent coastal state"".Mr Gove told the BBC that from 2021 the UK would control fishing access to a 200 nautical mile ""exclusive economic zone"" around its coastline. While he would not be drawn on what share of catch the UK could keep in this area after Brexit, he said there was no reason the UK should be in a ""weaker position"" than Norway or Iceland - which retains 80% and 95% respectively of fish caught in their territorial waters.""Like other independent coastal states, we can decide who has access to our waters and we can ensure that a greater proportion of the fish in our waters is caught by British vessels, landed in British ports and processed by British producers,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today.While accepting there would still be annual negotiations over catch quotas in British waters, he said ""it will be a negotiation where we hold the cards and we are in the driving seat"". Mr Gove said market access for fish exports - which has yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU - would be treated separately from the question of access to each other's waters. The EU has previously suggested the two issues should be tied together.During a Commons debate on the plans, Conservative MP John Redwood said Brexit could be a fillip for the UK's 10,000 or so fish and chip shops.""Isn't it the case that we have a huge opportunity here to make sure that much more of the fish is landed by our boats in order to make sure that our traditional fish and chips is once again fish from our fishing grounds, properly looked after by a national policy?"" he said.But Labour warned of a gap between what Mr Gove hoped for and what he could deliver.""This white paper is full of optimism for the negotiations but the only deal so far agreed on fishing is we'll keep EU fishing policies during the transition period - and we're not holding our breath that this will all go according to plan,"" said shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman. Ministers have said they will publish an annual statement of fish stocks and work with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments, to whom fishing policy is devolved, to help any struggling stocks to recover as well as helping them to ""maximise their power to manage their fisheries"". But the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman Stephen Gethins said there was no mention in the report of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, which he said had been vital in helping coastal communities in Scotland and across the UK to diversify. ""There are a number of areas where we think there have been omissions,"" he told BBC News.""And half the fish landed are sold into European markets so there are concerns around what will happen with that valuable product.""Scottish Fishermen's Federation chief executive Bertie Armstrong - who has suggested the UK could emulate Norway and Iceland - urged ministers to show ""real backbone"" in the negotiations ahead.""At last we have a positive statement of taking back control of our waters and righting some of the wrongs that have been running for forty years,"" he said.Fishing featured prominently in the 2016 EU referendum campaign, with Leave campaigners saying the current rules encouraged overfishing and mismanaged stocks - and it led to one of the campaign's most memorable moments as Nigel Farage and Bob Geldof traded insults on boats during a protest on the Thames.UKIP's fishing spokesman Mike Hookem warned the industry would see little change under Mr Gove's plans. Gove's #FisheriesWhitePaper is nothing more than a smokescreen to maintain the CFP status quo! If the Minister thinks the UK industry will settle for a few extra fish, while a small minority walk away with the rest, he is kidding himself.

The Muslim Council of Britain recently complained that its own request for an inquiry had been ignored and accused the party of ""turning a blind eye"" to the issue.It has compiled a dossier listing Conservative councillors and candidates who have been suspended or expelled following allegations of anti-Muslim prejudice.It has voiced concern about the tone of Richmond Park MP Zac Goldsmith's 2016 campaign for the London mayoralty, and about social media messages shared by Harrow East MP Bob Blackman - who has strongly denied any allegation of anti-Muslim prejudice.In an article for the Guardian, Baroness Warsi - who was the UK's first female Muslim cabinet minister - said both Mr Goldsmith and Mr Blackman should receive ""mandatory enrolment"" on diversity training courses.The Conservatives' promise of voluntary courses for those who wanted them was ""not enough"", she said, warning the party needed to be ""proactive and change its culture"".The peer said she had written to Theresa May about the issue and submitted a dossier of evidence but ""absolutely nothing tangible"" had happened in response.The time for an internal investigation had passed, she said, and only a ""forensic, wide-ranging and transparent inquiry"" would now suffice. The Conservatives say any members found to have behaved inappropriately have been suspended and investigations launched. "

""However, media statements soon indicated the negotiations were being undermined,"" he said. ""So we must park the proposal for the time being and revert to established procedure.""Mr Price added: ""We cannot put off the irresistible call for defining change.  ""Change in the way we frame our politics; the projection of who we are, what we stand for, what we have fought long and hard for and what's ultimately important to us.""Mr ap Iorwerth was the first to launch his campaign, via a social media video on Wednesday, saying Ms Wood had invited a debate on the leadership and that supporters and party members across Wales had ""encouraged me to allow my name to go forward"". He said: ""That encouragement has come from people at all elected levels, but mainly from ordinary party members, including some who, I'm quite sure, will back Leanne!""Mr ap Iorwerth said he was accepting the nominations in the spirit of a ""constructive debate"" that can ""energise the party and the country"".""My commitment is to Wales, and to a fairer and more prosperous future for the country,"" he said. ""Plaid Cymru has to lead the way to that new, confident Wales"".Something has not been connecting for Plaid - we have not seen the electoral earthquake predicted by Adam Price, the tectonic plates haven't shifted to any degree.That has led to a growing sense of malaise in the Plaid Cymru assembly group. Some wanted Leanne Wood to move away from niche issues, others think the only way to power is to extend a hand to the Tories. It just became apparent that people wanted different things and the leader couldn't accommodate.My sense is that both rival candidates would rather it hadn't come to this. Plaid's pivotal momentBefore joining the assembly, Mr ap Iorwerth was a reporter and presenter for BBC Wales, and presented Newyddion 9 on S4C.He became an AM in a by-election in 2013, succeeding former Plaid leader Ieuan Wyn Jones who stepped down from the assembly to run a science park.Earlier in June Mr ap Iorwerth told a press conference that he had ""no plans and neither does anyone else have plans to put their name forward in that particular window"".Mr Price was an MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr from 2001 to 2010. An attempt he and other MPs made to impeach Tony Blair over the Iraq War in 2004 failed.After voluntarily leaving the Commons in 2010 he embarked on a Fulbright scholarship at Harvard University.  He was elected to the Welsh Assembly in 2016, once again representing Carmarthen East and Dinefwr."

Here is a guide to the ""who, why, and when"".Why is there a contest? Carwyn Jones shocked the Welsh Labour conference in April when he announced he would step down as their leader and first minister at the end of the year.  He said he had been through ""the darkest of times"" - a reference to the death last November of Carl Sargeant, four days after Mr Jones sacked him as communities secretary. Who is in the running?Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford was first to declare, with backing from more than the minimum five AMs needed for the nomination.   Vaughan Gething, Eluned Morgan and Huw Irranca-Davies have also said they want to stand but unless the rules change on nominations not all of them will get onto the ballot paper.When will the winner be named?Welsh Labour will hold a special conference in September to decide the rules of the contest, amid debate over whether it should be one member one vote (OMOV) or an electoral college which gives more weight to the views of MPs, AMs and organisations such as trade unions.   The result is expected around early December, nine years to the month that Carwyn Jones took over from Rhodri Morgan.Why is there a contest?Neil Hamilton was ousted as leader of the five-strong UKIP group in May by Caroline Jones, who promised a more collaborative approach to Senedd politics.  The former Tory MP vowed to regain the group leadership, prompting UKIP HQ in London to step in and order a ballot of UKIP members in Wales to settle the row.Who is in the running?Neil Hamilton and Caroline Jones have both declared their intention to stand, along with Gareth Bennett, who has vowed to campaign to abolish the assembly.When will the winner be named?UKIP has said it expects to announce the result of the membership ballot by the end of July.Why is there a contest?Andrew RT Davies quit the leadership last Wednesday feeling he had lost the support of his colleagues.  He had been condemned within the party the previous Friday for accusing firms such as Airbus of undermining Brexit by voicing their concerns about the impact on trade.    But the ardent supporter of Brexit later told BBC Wales he had been aware of moves to unseat him for some time. Who is in the running?Interim leader Paul Davies has said he would like the job on a permanent basis, and Suzy Davies has also put her name forward.  While both backed Remain in the 2016 referendum on Europe, former Welsh Secretary David Jones has said the next assembly group leader should reflect what he called the ""overwhelmingly Eurosceptic"" views of grassroots members in Wales.When will the winner be named?A postal ballot of Welsh Conservative members will take place in August, and the result declared on 6 September. Why is there a contest?Plaid rules allow for a leadership contest every two years, and the window for a challenge closed on Wednesday.  Despite Leanne Wood's high profile in TV election debates in recent years, there has been unhappiness within party ranks at the apparent lack of progress in terms of AMs and MPs elected.   In June Ms Wood said she would welcome a contest and felt ""very"" confident of winning it.Who is in the running?Earlier in June Rhun ap Iorwerth said he had ""no plans"" to challenge Ms Wood, but has announced a bid saying she had invited a debate on Plaid's leadership and supporters had urged him to stand.  On Monday, Adam Price called on Ms Wood to share the leadership with a man to boost Plaid's fortunes or face the prospect of a challenge.  She turned the proposal down and Mr Price has now thrown his hat into the ring too.When will the winner be named?Plaid Cymru says it will announce a timetable shortly.The Welsh Lib Dems had a leadership election last November, when Jane Dodds beat Elizabeth Evans in a vote of the membership.   She took over from Mark Williams, the last remaining Welsh Lib Dem MP who stepped down after losing his Ceredigion seat at the 2017 general election.   With the sole Lib Dem AM Kirsty Williams serving in the Welsh Government as education secretary, the party changed its rules which previously said the Welsh leader had to be an AM or MP.    "
2018-07-04,Hard or soft?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180705034106/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44532288,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA ""make-or-break"" meeting on the UK's future relationship with the European Union will be held by ministers this week. Have the voters they represent been able to decide what kind of Brexit they want?Two years after the UK narrowly voted to leave the European Union, ministers are working towards the withdrawal deadline of 29 March 2019 - despite reports that they are divided over what Brexit should look like.The debate - which has also seen arguments about whether there should be referendum on a final deal - is often presented as a choice between so-called ""hard"" and ""soft"" Brexit. These terms mean different things to different people - but a ""hard"" Brexit is generally taken to mean a significant change, with the UK leaving the EU single market and customs union, and no longer implementing EU freedom of movement rules.""Soft"" Brexit is often used to describe the UK keeping some kind of free trade arrangement with the EU, remaining in a customs union and allowing EU citizens to live and work in the UK. But where do the UK's voters, who remain more or less evenly divided on whether they support leaving the EU, stand on what the future relationship should be like post-Brexit? Please upgrade your browserTwo polling companies, Opinium and ORB International, have been tracking this issue since the referendum. The wording of their questions is important.Opinium asked voters: ""If it becomes apparent that we will not be able to have one without the other, which of the following should be the government's negotiating priority during the Brexit negotiations?  Staying in the single market even if it means allowing free movement of labour, or ending free movement of labour even if it means we leave the single market?""The first option refers to a ""soft"" Brexit, the second to a ""hard"" one.The graph below shows the average percentage choosing each answer at four key points since January 2017.Three things stand out. First, many voters find answering this question difficult - about a quarter continue to say they are not sure which would be the better choice. It may be some are struggling with what is meant by ""the single market"" or ""free movement"", while others would perhaps like to be able to do both.Second, there is no clear majority in favour of either option. Third, there seems to have been a slight - but only slight - tilt in favour of staying in the single market rather than ending free movement. The four-point advantage for staying in the single market contrasts with a five-point lead for ending free movement in a couple of polls that Opinium conducted in early 2017. But this is just one question from one company. And all pollsters know the answer they get often depends on how the question is posed. ORB has taken a different approach.Every month since November 2016, it has asked people to agree or disagree with the following proposition: ""Having greater control over immigration ['hard Brexit'] is more important than having access to free trade with the EU ['soft Brexit']."" The graph shows the average for all the polls conducted in five time periods.Voters evidently find ORB's question easier to answer, though as many as 15% still stay they don't know. Among those who do answer, slightly more say they back a hard Brexit - that is, they agree that controlling immigration is more important than free trade with the EU. There is no consistent evidence that this picture has changed during the past two years.However, ORB's data confirms Opinium's suggestion that the UK is split in its views about the kind of Brexit it would like to see.This is perhaps not surprising given that the country is still more or less evenly divided between Remain and Leave.In its recent polls, Opinium has found that, on average, about two-thirds of Remain voters (68%) prioritise staying in the single market, while three-fifths of Leave supporters (61%) feel it is more important to end free movement. The balance of opinion among Conservative and Labour supporters is rather different too. According to Opinium, 40% of Conservative supporters would prioritise ending free movement and only 20% staying in the single market. But among Labour supporters, the equivalent figures are 11% and 45% respectively. Some of the demographic divisions revealed by the 2016 referendum are repeated in the hard-v-soft debate too. ORB's recent polls suggest only 26% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 35% of 25- to 34-year-olds agree it is more important to control immigration than to secure access to free trade with the EU. In contrast, most of those aged 65 or over (56%) and 55- to 64-year-olds (53%) hold that view.Meanwhile, women (38%) are much more likely than men (16%) to say they are not sure whether the UK should stay in the single market, or end free movement.Another aspect of the hard-v-soft debate on which polling has been relatively scarce is whether or not the UK should stay in a customs union with the EU. But in the past couple of months, Opinium has asked people if they've heard about a customs union, and whether the government should try to stay in the EU customs union in order to prioritise EU trade or to leave it to allow the UK to grow its trade links with the rest of the world. On both occasions, more than a fifth said they had not heard of the customs union at all, while 16-17% said they didn't know what the government's priority should be. So, despite the heated debate the issue has recently generated at Westminster, it appears to have passed many voters by. Among those with a preference, public opinion is again more or less evenly divided, with 31-32% arguing the UK should stay in the customs union and 30% disagreeing. How Sweden is preparing for Russia to hack its electionLocal election results 2018: How important was the Brexit effect?Why politicians often row about taxThe six tribes that could shape Europe's futureSo, however the issue is addressed, two points stand out about public attitudes towards Brexit. First, many voters are not at all sure about what kind of Brexit they would like. Second, among those who do have a view, opinion is more or less evenly divided. This makes it very difficult for any politician to be sure how best to interpret the ""will of the people"" as expressed in the EU referendum. But that is the challenge that they face as the Brexit negotiations now move up a gear.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.John Curtice is professor of politics at Strathclyde University and research fellow at the NatCen Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.He is also chief commentator at WhatUKthinks.org.Edited by Jennifer Clarke"

2018-07-04,New customs plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20180705034106/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44694861,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSo, finally, Theresa May has found a way. Not to get Brexit over the finishing line, obviously. But at least out of the starting block. Or so she hopes.Not to unite the Cabinet. No-one could do that. But at least to herd most of them into line behind her. Or so she hopes.And if one or two can't or won't get with the programme - there's the door.The door, of course, being the door of Chequers, her country retreat, where she'll gather her Cabinet again on Friday and try - very hard, apparently - to get agreement on her plan for a negotiating position which might, just might, fly in Brussels.How, though? Theresa May's ""red-lines"" always look and sound very red and very clear. They did again yesterday in the Commons when she pledged Britain to leave the EU, the customs union and the single market. That, I'm now told by well placed sources, is still the plan. Sort of. Only the so-called ""third option"" for Britain's future customs relationship with the EU looks much like an amalgam of the two which ran into a Cabinet road block - and on close examination more like the close ""customs partnership"", which Mrs May came to prefer, than any other. Not that it's being sold to Brexiteers like that. And there is a lot in the new plan that might appeal, as it must, to the Brexiteer gallery.So what's the big idea?A single market trade deal on goods is the vital component. Business will probably like that, as far as it goes. Though, it won't be called a single market because that sounds too aligned to Brussels. Agri-food trade would be part of that deal too. It has to be to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - which is vital if Brexit talks in Brussels are to get anywhere at all.What then of services? And financial services? The Cabinet is split. Business Secretary Greg Clark's not alone in wanting a single market deal - or whatever it's called - to include services. But that's not, I gather, the plan. City firms saw this coming, and are saying again today they want in. But Theresa May's way is to make them wait during the Brexit transition while negotiations go on. The City is undoubtedly concerned about the impact of Brexit, particularly the risk of a ""hard Brexit"" and negotiations ending in no deal at all. Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, expressed the same concerns last week.But the fact is you don't need a single services market to avoid a hard Irish border. There is still time to negotiate the nature and degree of alignment between the UK and the EU.Theresa May will stick to her red lines. Only they'll soon start to look a little blurred. No customs union, at least as it's defined now. No customs checks, or tariffs on goods either, but Britain would apply EU level tariffs, except where the UK can seek and sign trade deals beyond Europe (leave aside, for a moment, the view of much derided ""experts"" that outside trade deals will be low value or, in the case of America, say, tough on the UK and dependent on deregulation - and not just of chlorinated chicken). Where UK tariffs are lower than the EU's there'd be refunds.The European Court of Justice has been a huge sticking point. May's solution, I'm told, envisages some middle way; some some form of trade arbitration that ultimately, in some way, recognises, the court's authority. And as for the big deep red line of freedom of movement of people. There's room for some concession here too, in the name of ""labour mobility"". It's been thought that Home Secretary Sajid Javid is against preferential access for EU citizens. But I'm hearing he may be open to the idea if it's part of a decent trade deal.So, will the Cabinet Brexiteers and sceptics buy it? That's the prime minister's big gamble. Some in government suspect she may duck a decisive confrontation even now. But assuming she's up for it: Boris must decide whether to work with her, and fight his corner on the inside, or walk and pursue his private interests, somehow becoming Britain's next prime minister conceivably somewhere on the list. Brexit Secretary David Davis? Hard to know. But he sees his job as a contribution to history and won't, surely, want to give it up if he can avoid it. His hopes of becoming PM may, like Boris Johnson's, have taken a knock. But then the list of Tories who want to be prime minister is now almost as long as the list of those who don't.The Tory MPs' shop steward, the Chairman of the Tory 1922 Committee of MPs, Sir Graham Brady has been appealing for order and loyalty in the weekend papers, and recently in a BBC interview. That's the sort of thing chairmen - and chairwomen if there ever is one - of the ""22"" are meant to say. But remember Graham Brady is also a passionate Brexiteer. He was being helpful to Mrs May.There's a plan then. There are still lots of blanks to wrangle over at Chequers before it can be slotted into the gaps in the coming policy Brexit White Paper, and that won't be settled quickly or easily. It's a test of the prime minister's nerve, and the willingness of her Cabinet colleagues to cause trouble.Brussels won't like much or any of it very much. They will likely fear leaving a Britain-shaped hole in the borders of the EU single market. They won't like the ""cherry picking"" of the rules which govern single market or customs union membership - however you may choose to describe those arrangements.Plans, even definitive plans, can change and often do. But at least there is a plan. And that's something. What could go wrong now? Apart from everything."

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-04,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180705034106/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Theresa May has said they have ""a duty"" to reach agreement on Friday, amid splits over how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit.She is expected to propose keeping the UK aligned with the EU on trading rules for goods but not services.An ex-minister warned that would mean ""something less than the full Brexit"".If ministers reach an agreement, the EU can then choose to accept or reject their proposals.Speaking on Friday, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""ready to adapt our offer should the UK's red lines change"" but insisted there could be no ""unravelling"" of the single market. Ministers are expected to be at Chequers, a 16th Century house in Buckinghamshire which is the PM's country residence, until about 22.00 GMT. They had to hand in their phones and any smartwatches on arrival. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the proposal would include a common rulebook on some sectors - like industrial goods and agricultural goods - for ""practical"" supply chain reasons.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm pretty confident we will end up with a concrete position which everybody is able to sign up to.""But Brexiteer ministers are understood to be unhappy. Seven cabinet ministers met at the Foreign Office on Thursday evening to discuss the proposal.There have also been suggestions that the prime minister's proposal would make a US trade deal more difficult. No 10 says it is ""categorically untrue that we will not be able to strike a trade deal with the US"".David Jones, a former minister at the Department for Exiting the EU, said Mrs May's proposal looked set to breach her ""red lines"" on leaving the customs union, single market and jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. BBC Political Editor Laura KuenssbergOften the hype about a political event is in inverse proportion to the drama of what actually comes to pass. Maybe not this time.To say that Brexiteer ministers are a bit miffed with Mrs May's plan, which they only received in its entirety on Thursday afternoon, is an understatement. There is plenty in there that they don't like, and it's easy to see why.Ahead of the meeting, Mrs May said the cabinet had ""a great opportunity - and a duty. To set an ambitious course to enhance our prosperity and security outside the European Union - and to build a country that genuinely works for everyone"".Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said a workable agreement that could be taken to the EU was needed and ""simply a truce in the cabinet was not good enough for Britain"". Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said time was running out for the UK and the worst outcome would be ministers emerging ""arm in arm, saying they've agreed, because that means there's another helping of fudge being served up and what is being put forward is likely to be rejected by Europe"". Meanwhile sources close to David Cameron confirmed the former PM met Boris Johnson on Thursday and discussed Brexit.But they said there was ""no grand view"" on the negotiations and disputed reports Mr Cameron had agreed that Theresa May's plan was the ""worst of all worlds"".There have been differing views within the cabinet about how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit, and what compromises should be made to achieve ""as frictionless as possible"" trade.The aim is to agree a UK proposal on how future relations should work on Friday, the details of which would then be published in a White Paper net week.That would then be the subject of negotiations with the EU - which might have different ideas.Ministers have yet to agree what they want to replace the UK's membership of the EU's customs union, which allows for tariff-free trading between members.One of the key issues is the need to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the UK is outside the customs union.The EU and UK say there can be no return to a hard border. But Eurosceptic MPs say tying the UK to the EU after it leaves will prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries.Meanwhile 46 other Conservative MPs have urged Mrs May to listen to the voice of business and target a deal which enables ""frictionless trade to continue"".Please upgrade your browserThe ""facilitated customs arrangement"" is understood to be a proposal for a post-Brexit customs agreement which would allow the UK the freedom to set its own tariffs on goods arriving into the country. Technology would be used to determine where the goods will ultimately end up - and therefore whether UK or EU tariffs should be paid.It would keep the UK aligned to EU regulations in some sectors- such as industrial and agricultural goods - but Parliament would be able to decide where to deviate.Details of how the plan would work in practice have yet to be published. But Downing Street says it is confident the arrangement would be partly in place by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020 - with the system being fully operational by the next general election, due in 2022.It is not clear whether the EU will agree to it.The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019. But to allow time for parliaments in the UK and the EU to approve whatever deal is agreed, the aim is for the framework for future relations to be agreed this autumn.But the UK government has not, as yet, settled on what its post-Brexit relationship with the EU should look like.EU leaders last week told Mrs May it was time to ""lay the cards on the table"" if a Brexit deal was to be done on time.Businesses, including Jaguar Land Rover, Airbus and BMW, have also been stepping up the pressure on the government to provide more detail."

It does endorse the IHRA's working definition of anti-Semitism and includes behaviours it lists as likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics think it leaves out four examples: However, Labour insisted the examples which are not in the bulleted section are addressed in the guidelines.In their joint statement, Jonathan Goldstein of the Jewish Leadership Council and Marie van der Zyl of the Board of Deputies said it was ""for Jews to determine themselves what anti-Semitism is"".The Labour Against Anti-Semitism campaign described it as a ""toothless document"" adding: ""The Labour Party already has very little credibility left as the anti-racist body it has always claimed to be. ""The formal adoption of this document would see any remaining credibility lost, perhaps permanently.""A Labour source said Labour Against Anti-Semitism's claims were ""ludicrous and entirely false"".And a spokesman for the Labour Party said: ""These are the most detailed and comprehensive guidelines on anti-Semitism adopted by any political party in this country.""They draw on the IHRA examples and other sources to provide practical examples of anti-Semitism which can be applied to complaints cases and used in political education programmes to foster deeper understanding of anti-Semitism among members.""Mr Umunna and Ms Turley are not the only Labour MPs to criticise the code.

Mark Carney said recent data had given him ""greater confidence"" that weak first-quarter growth ""was largely due to the weather"". He said household spending and sentiment had ""bounced back strongly"".England winning the World Cup would be an ""unalloyed, unadulterated absolute good"" for the economy, Mr Carney added.In a speech at the Northern Powerhouse Summit in Newcastle, Mr Carney said: ""Overall, recent domestic data suggest the economy is evolving largely in line with the May Inflation Report projections, which see demand growing at rates slightly above those of supply and domestic cost pressures building.""The pound edged up 0.2% against the dollar to $1.3254 following his remarks.Last month, three members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee - including chief economist Andy Haldane - voted in favour of lifting the interest rate to 0.75%. Mr Carney was among the six MPC members who voted to keep rates on hold at 0.5%.  He also warned that a global trade war could dampen economic growth.Mr Carney said ""protectionist rhetoric"" was rising and was now turning into action: ""There are some, tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity.""He cited evidence from the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI), which suggested that global export orders and manufacturing output have fallen back from highs at the start of the year.On Friday, the US will implement a 25% import tariff on a list of hundreds of Chinese goods. On the same day, China will also impose 25% tariffs on a range of US goods, including pork products, fish and rice.

Charlie Rowley, 45, and Dawn Sturgess, 44, collapsed at a house in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on Saturday and remain critically ill.Home secretary Sajid Javid said the nerve agent was the same as that used on ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in March.Russia said Theresa May's government was subjecting them ""to hell"".Mr Javid accused Russia of using Britain as a ""dumping ground for poison"" after the second incident involving the nerve agent.But a Russian Embassy spokesman said all allegations of the country's involvement were ""merely speculative"". The Met said there were around 100 detectives from the Counter Terrorism Network working alongside Wiltshire Police on the ""major incident"". Salisbury District Hospital's chief executive Cara Charles-Barks said the couple are ""extremely unwell"" and remain in a critical condition. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said that because the highest concentration of Novichok was found on the couple's hands, police believe the item they handled could be a container or receptacle that was used to carry the nerve agent.He said the most likely hypothesis is that the Novichok was left over from an item discarded after the attack on the Skripals. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said there was nothing in the couple's background to suggest the pair had been targeted.The BBC's home affairs correspondent June Kelly said it has been suggested the item ""could be a vial or syringe because of the couple's lifestyle"". Chemical weapons expert Richard Guthrie said it was possible that the couple came across the Novichok after it had been disposed of ""in a haphazard way"".Debbie Stark, south west deputy director from Public Health England said the risk to the public of further poisoning incidents ""remains low"".Police have set up a helpline for anyone who needs further advice: 0800 092 0410 or 0207 158 0124.In a statement to MPs, Mr Javid said: ""It is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on.""He said the ""strong working assumption"" was that the couple came into contact with Novichok in a location which had not been cleaned up following the Skripal poisoning in nearby Salisbury.""It is completely unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns, to be dumping grounds for poison,"" he added.He said he could not rule out the possibility that the Novichok found in Amesbury was from the same batch used in the Salisbury attack and that scientists would be ""looking into that"".Earlier, Mrs May said it was ""deeply disturbing"" to see two more people exposed to Novichok in the UK, and the police would leave ""no stone unturned in their investigation"".Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said British streets must not be allowed to become ""killing fields for state actors"".But the spokesman for the Russian Embassy said the government had yet to contact them about the incidentHe added: ""Instead of genuine co-operation, London is doing everything possible to muddy the waters, to confuse and frighten its own citizens. ""One can only guess what the reasons behind such a line of behaviour are."" Ms Sturgess' father Stephen, 65, told The Times the family found out from TV news that she may have been poisoned by a nerve agent.""We heard from the hospital on Sunday, and we gave them Dawn's GP details but we didn't hear anything from the police.""We know as much as the next person in the street. We actually called the police station for information.""Natalie Smyth from Amesbury said: ""I'm furious that it took four days for them [the police] to even mention it could have been Novichock."" ""Were they lying to us about it being drug related?""Although the risk to the public remains low, Public Health England (PHE) have advised those who were in the areas from 22:00 BST on Friday and which are now cordoned off to wash their clothes and wipe down personal items.Clothing that cannot be washed should be double-bagged and owners should await ""further instructions"".Debbie Stark from PHE said areas of Salisbury that have already been cleaned as part of the Skripal incident - such as the Maltings shopping centre - are safe.Residents at John Baker House, the supported housing where Ms Sturgess is believed to have been staying, have been evacuated and told they will have to be rehoused.The police warned members of the public against picking up unfamiliar items.Sites in Amesbury and Salisbury believed to have been visited by the couple before they fell ill have been cordoned off as a precaution, including a church, park and chemist.This latest incident is likely to raise fears about the efficiency of  the multimillion pound clean-up to decontaminate nine locations across Salisbury after the Skripal poisoning.The revelation that two more people have been exposed to the nerve agent Novichock has shocked people in Salisbury. Residents have experienced months of disruption and anxiety since the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March. Now many are wondering whether, despite a clean-up operation, their city is safe?Read more hereThere have been accusations from Russia that the UK is persecuting the country and failing to co-operate.The Skripal case is still shrouded in darkness, says Russia spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, as she called on Theresa May's government to stop the ""dirty"" games.She said Russia has sent ""dozens of offers of co-operation"" and she was confident London would have to apologise to her country.Are you in the area?

Ms McVey said she would meet the NAO boss on Monday and again apologised for ""the phrasing of the words"" she used. But she insisted that Universal Credit was helping people get into employment.For the second successive day in the Commons she stood by her claim that the NAO (National Audit Office) report on Universal Credit did not take into account the latest developments, saying that changes made earlier this year had not fed through during the period covered, which was to April this year.The head of the NAO - Sir Amyas Morse - took the unusual step on Wednesday of publicly writing to Ms McVey to take issue with how she had responded to the report on Monday.Among the issues he raised, he said: ""I'm afraid your statement that the NAO was concerned Universal Credit is currently 'rolling but too slowly' and needs to 'continue at a faster rate' is also not correct. ""While we recognise regrettable early delays, my recommendation made clearly on page 11 of the report is the department must now ensure it is ready before it starts to transfer people over from previous benefits.""Ms McVey apologised for her wording on this point when she appeared in the Commons on Wednesday, and again on Thursday.She explained her error to MPs by saying the report had said there was ""no practical alternative"" to Universal Credit and that it had also said it regretted the slow pace of its roll-out, so she had taken that to mean the NAO was recommending it be speeded up.She added: ""If people know me they will always say about me I am open and I am straight and I will say it is as it is.""Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""The secretary of state should be ashamed she has been forced to come to this House again.""Why and how did she come to say falsely over two separate occasions in this Parliament that the NAO report said the roll-out of Universal Credit should be speeded up?""How can these statements be inadvertent  slips of the tongue? Has she ever read the NAO report? If she has, how can she draw the conclusions that she has? If she misread these reports so badly, this brings into question her competence and her judgement. ""If she did the read the report and chose to misrepresent its findings, she has clearly broken the ministerial code. Either way, she should resign."" In the report published last month, the NAO said the government's flagship benefits system was not delivering value for money and could end up costing more to administer than the benefits system it is replacing. It warned some claimants switching to Universal Credit, which rolls six working-age benefits into one, had waited eight months to be paid. While the report noted that the Department for Work and Pensions did ""not accept"" that Universal Credit had caused hardship among claimants, it pointed to a recent internal departmental report that showed 40% of claimants were experiencing financial difficulties.Universal Credit merges six benefits (income support; income-based jobseeker's allowance; income-related employment and support allowance; housing benefit; child tax credit; working tax credit) into one.It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler. A single payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover the benefits for which they are eligible.Claimants then have to pay costs, such as rent, out of their UC payment. It can be claimed by people whether they are in or out of work - but payment decreases as you earn more.SNP frontbencher Alison Thewliss said the NAO report ""blows a hole as wide as the Clyde through everything the Tories have been saying"" on Universal Credit.Labour MP Meg Hillier asked Ms McVey to confirm that she had confidence in the NAO, with the minister replying that ""they do their job"".Ms McVey said her department believed Universal Credit would bring a £34bn benefit to the UK economy over the next 10 years and a 200,000 increase in employment.She said that Labour had predicted that a million more people would be unemployed if Universal Credit was brought in, but actually millions more people were in work and she added: ""I have never asked Labour to apologise for their misleading figures.""Universal Credit is currently available in 353 job centres and the government says it is ""on track"" to be rolled out to all job centres nationally by the end of 2018.In her 2 July statement, Ms McVey said 83% of claimants who responded had said they were satisfied with customer service.

But to allow time for parliaments in the UK and the EU to approve whatever deal is agreed, the aim is for the framework for future relations to be agreed this autumn. According to No 10, the new plan would allow the UK the freedom to set its own tariffs on goods arriving into the country.Technology would be used to determine where the goods will ultimately end up - and therefore whether UK or EU tariffs should be paid.Downing Street says it is confident the arrangement would be partly in place by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020 - with the system being fully operational by the next general election, which is due in 2022.On regulations, it is understood that the UK would closely mirror the EU's rules - but Parliament would be able to decide where to deviate. However, the arrangement has not been explained in full - and it is not clear whether the cabinet will back the plan, or whether the EU would agree.A source close to Brexit Secretary David Davis refused to comment on a Daily Telegraph report that he had already told Mrs May the plan was unworkable.Mr Davis and Mrs May were ""working closely on what will be presented on Friday"", the source said.However Mr Davis is expected to ""forcefully"" express his doubts and reservations about the compromise plan, including the view that it could be a mistake to set out too much of the UK's negotiating position at this stagePlease upgrade your browserAmong the issues that need to be resolved is the need to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the UK is outside the customs union.Eurosceptic MPs have warned Mrs May against tying the UK to the EU after it leaves, saying this will prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. Meanwhile 46 other Conservative MPs have written to Mrs May urging her to listen to the voice of business and target a deal which enables ""frictionless trade to continue"".After Friday's meeting, the government is expected to publish a White Paper setting out its plans in detail.The European Union asked a series of questions about the UK's previous customs proposals and they are still relevant. Will it be temporary? Does it solve the Irish border issue fully or partly? Does it respect the integrity of EU customs policy? How is it supervised? How will the UK system evolve as the EU's does? Will the EU need to change its trade policy? But customs is only a fraction of the relationship between the UK and the EU and so the British idea of aligning to some European regulations is a much bigger deal. And the priority in Brussels is to find a solution to the Northern Irish border. ""If there isn't a deal on that then things could turn nasty quite quickly,"" a diplomat told me. The EU is waiting to see the full White Paper. Officials from the 27 remaining countries are primed to meet soon after it is published and ministers will give their reaction at a meeting on 20 July but civil servants in Brussels expect to be combing through it until the end of the month at least.

2018-07-05,Jaguar boss: Brexit threatens investment,https://web.archive.org//web/20180706101631/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44719656,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJaguar Land Rover has warned that a ""bad"" Brexit deal would threaten £80bn worth of investment plans for the UK and may force it to close factories. The UK's biggest carmaker, owned by India's Tata Motors, said its ""heart and soul is in the UK"".But without frictionless trade JLR said its UK investment plans would be in jeopardy.The warning came as Downing Street set out details of a possible post-Brexit customs arrangement.Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Ralf Speth said: ""A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than £1.2bn profit each year.""As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. We have spent around £50bn in the UK in the past five years - with plans for a further £80bn more in the next five.""This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.""Mr Speth said the firm urgently needs ""greater certainty"" to continue to investing heavily in the UK.He told the Financial Times: ""If I'm forced to go out because we don't have the right deal, then we have to close plants here in the UK and it will be very, very sad. This is hypothetical, and I hope it's an option we never have to go for.""Uncertainty over Brexit, as well as the future of diesel cars, has already led the carmaker to announce a series of changes to its UK business.At the beginning of the year, JLR said it would cut production at its plant in Halewood, Merseyside where it builds three of its Range Rover models.In April, it decided not to renew the contracts for 1,000 temporary workers in Solihull. Last month, JLR said it would shift production of the Land Rover Discovery SUV to Slovakia, potentially leading to some UK job losses.However, the carmaker also said that it was investing in its Solihull site to allow it to build its new Range Rover models, some of which will be electric-powered, from 2020.PB Balaji, chief financial officer at Tata Motors, said: ""Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Motors have always maintained that the uncertainties from Brexit are avoidable and the business seeks clarity to ensure that industry takes timely and right decisions to manage the transition.""Additionally, Jaguar Land Rover needs free and full access to the single market beyond transition to remain competitive which we also firmly believe is in the best long term interests of the United Kingdom.""The recent statement from JLR only reaffirms this position that a Brexit which increases bureaucracy, reduces productivity and competitiveness of the UK industry is in no-one's interest.""As well as Halewood and Solihull, JLR also has a manufacturing plant in Castle Bromwich, Birmingham where it makes its Jaguar cars.Last year, it made more than 600,000 cars, 20% of which were sold to mainland Europe, one of its biggest markets.JLR said that it spent £5.67bn with UK suppliers of production parts during its last financial year, as well as £5.37bn with EU-based businesses.Simon Jack, BBC business editorJLR may be Indian-owned, but its brand and - as the company puts it - its heart and soul is in the UK.It employs 40,000 people directly and 260,000 work in its supply chain. JLR's warning follows those of Airbus, BMW and Nissan who have all said further investment in the UK is ""under review"" and could be cancelled if the country leaves the EU without a deal that ensures frictionless trade. JLR insiders say £80bn worth of future investment in the UK over the next five years ""could be lost"".The intervention of such a major employer - which in many ways is rightly perceived as more British than the likes of BMW, Airbus and Nissan - will heap more pressure on the government ahead of a crunch meeting of government ministers on Friday. At this meeting, business hopes the government will finally settle on its own preferred version of the UK's future economic relationship with its largest market. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the government was ""determined"" to make sure JLR could ""continue to prosper and invest in Britain"".The Jaguar Land Rover warning follows similar statements from BMW and Airbus. However, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called these warnings ""completely inappropriate"".JLR is a great British success story. We are determined to make sure that it can continue to prosper and to invest in Britain. https://t.co/DQ5lSpM2obEnd of Twitter post  by @GregClarkMPMeanwhile, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has warned in a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier that failure to reach an agreement to ensure frictionless trade will  result in customs delays for perishable goods. The BRC says that a third of the food consumed in the UK is imported from the EU."

It put a greater responsibility on websites to enforce copyright laws, and would have meant that any online platform that allowed users to post text, images, sounds or code would need a way to assess and filter content.The most common way to do this is by using an automated copyright system, but they are expensive. The one YouTube uses cost $60m (£53m), so critics were worried that similar filters would need to be introduced to every website if Article 13 became law.There were also concerns that these copyright filters could effectively ban things like memes and remixes which use some copyrighted material.By Mark Savage, music reporter, BBC NewsThe combined clout of Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, Placido Domingo and David Guetta wasn't enough to persuade MEPs to make sweeping changes to copyright law.They were among 1,300 musicians who urged politicians to enact a law forcing sites like YouTube and Facebook to use filters that would stop users illegally uploading their music.Musicians were being cheated out of money, they argued, even though websites were making huge profits off their work.Critics said the laws would stifle creativity - with Creative Commons chief Ryan Merkley observing that The Beatles would have been prevented from performing cover versions under the proposed rules.For you and me, it could have resulted in text, music and videos posted to blogs, social networks and comment sections being yanked from the net at point of upload - somewhat like YouTube's controversial Content ID system on steroids.In the end, MEPs decided the changes needed more debate; and sent the proposals back to the Commission. The two sides will undoubtedly step up their campaigns in the meantime.Opponents of the Copyright Directive celebrated the news that MEPs had rejected it. Julia Reda, a Pirate Party MEP who had campaigned against the changes, tweeted: ""Great success: Your protests have worked! The European Parliament has sent the copyright law back to the drawing board.""Great success: Your protests have worked! The European Parliament has sent the copyright law back to the drawing board. All MEPs will get to vote on #uploadfilters and the #linktax September 10–13. Now let's keep up the pressure to make sure we #SaveYourInternet! pic.twitter.com/VwqAgH0Xs5End of Twitter post  by @SenficonWikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales told the BBC he hoped that the music industry could find a way to compromise before the September debate.""Don't think about filtering everything everyone uploads to the internet. That's a pipe dream but you are never going to get that,"" he said.Instead, he added, they should look to renegotiating deals with platforms such as YouTube to get ""fairer remuneration"".BPI Music, which represents UK record labels, had supported the bill and said it would ""work with MEPs over the next weeks to explain how the proposed directive will benefit not just European creativity, but also internet users"".We respect the decision by MEPs to have a plenary discussion on the draft Copyright Directive. We will work with MEPs over the next weeks to explain how the proposed Directive will benefit not just European creativity, but also internet users and the technology sectorEnd of Twitter post  by @bpi_music"
2018-07-05,'Councils best at boosting failing schools',https://web.archive.org//web/20180706101631/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-44698272,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowCouncils are best when it comes to boosting the inspection grades of inadequate schools, analysis of official figures suggests. Researchers looked at how much schools rated inadequate by Ofsted in 2013 had improved by the end of 2017. Those schools that had remained council maintained were more likely to be good or outstanding than those that had become sponsored academies. The government says academy status helps schools raise standards. But the Local Government Association, said the research, which it commissioned, ""clearly demonstrates the excellent track records councils have in turning round failing schools"". Under changes introduced in 2016, all schools rated inadequate by Ofsted must now become ""sponsor-led academies"", which means being taken over by an academy chain or multi-academy trust and no longer being maintained by their local authority.Researchers from Angel Solutions, better known for producing the inspection analysis website Watchsted, looked at the inspection histories of 429 council maintained schools that had failed their Ofsted inspections in 2013. Of these, they found 152 had stayed with their local authority and 212 had become sponsored academies. Most of the remaining 65 either closed or were taken over by other schools. By December 2017: The Local Government Association, which is holding its annual conference in Birmingham this week, says the figures reinforce calls for the bar on councils intervening in struggling schools to be overturned. In a paper published on Thursday, local authorities argue that they should have a role in improving all schools found to be inadequate, whether maintained or academy schools. ""Underperforming schools are more likely to improve when supported by their local council than by an academy sponsor. ""In all areas of the country, maintained schools outperform academies,"" says the report. The LGA points out that councils have a duty to ensure all children and young people get a good education - but the current rules mean they have limited powers to hold academies to account for their standards. Roy Perry, vice-chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board, said the new figures clearly demonstrated ""the compelling need for councils to be recognised as effective education improvement partners, ready and able to support schools of all types"". ""It is not fair on children and parents to be denied the chance of a better education because their local council, with expertise in school improvement, is barred from helping,"" said Mr Perry. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""These calculations are misleading and fail to take into account that every school will have individual challenges, some of which, such as poor leadership and management, are far greater and taken longer to turn around, than others. ""Placing schools back under local authority control would be a backwards step and would not necessarily deliver the improvements in education children deserve."""

I've had a lot of treatment over the years. I don't know if I would have been able to afford it.""I take medication every day, but I've been lucky because it's obviously worked for me. I have every reason to be grateful to the NHS.""Her memories of her early treatment are quite hazy - she was only 20 months old in 1948.But she says all the nurses were ""very nice"" and remembers her mother bringing in her ration book to give sugar coupons to the women who made the tea ""so they could buy sweets for the children"".After finishing school she worked as a hairdresser for three years, but then retrained as a nurse, eventually specialising in surgical nursing.She has been telling her story as the NHS celebrates its 70th birthday.When the NHS was created it was the first time anywhere in the world that completely free healthcare was made available on the basis of citizenship rather than the payment of fees or insurance.Celebration events are taking place across the UK, including services at Westminster Abbey and York Minister.The NHS logo will also be projected on to famous landmarks including the Eden Project in Cornwall, the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye.There will also be thousands of NHS-themed public tea parties taking place.In a reception at Downing Street on Wednesday night for health staff, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the longevity of the NHS.""In my line of work there are not many ideas from 70 years ago that are unquestionably supported today, but that is undoubtedly the case with our National Health Service,"" she said. ""In a world that has changed almost beyond recognition, the vision at the heart of the NHS - of a tax-funded service that is available to all, free at the point of use with care based on clinical need and not the ability to pay - still retains near-universal acceptance.""Meanwhile, Game of Thrones TV star Emilia Clarke has also been paying her own tribute to the NHS.She has accepted the position of an ambassador for the Royal College of Nursing - something she said she was inspired to do following the excellent care her dying father received two years ago.She watched on as staff comforted him and then her and is now full of praise for the ""awe-inspiring skill"" and ""emotional intelligence"" they showed.""I know my dad received the best care and medical support.""To see family members suffer and then to see nurses selflessly care for that person means so much.""After a panic at hearing bells and buzzers I didn't understand, the hug that came my way and the words that accompanied it both reassured and comforted me.""The NHS is there for everyone - and we will all need it at some point.""Thursday is a time for celebration for the health service. But it also comes at a crucial point.The service has been struggling to hit its targets - it has been missing the key targets for cancer, A&E and hospital operations recently.

Maybe not this time. Cabinet ministers will today meet at Chequers with the aim of approving the prime minister's blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit. But Brexiteer ministers have warned that the 120-page plan as written is flawed. They were discussing late on Thursday how to respond during the cabinet meeting. And to say that they are a bit miffed with the plan, which they only received in its entirety on Thursday afternoon, is an understatement. There is plenty in there that they don't like, and it's easy to see why. The BBC understands that the plan includes:The paper also suggests that, while trade deals with other countries like the US would be possible, they might be harder to do because under rules agreed with the EU, it would be harder to meet other countries' ""asks"". One cabinet minister also expressed unhappiness with the proposed customs model - the facilitated customs arrangement - saying that it was like ""customs partnership minus"" - simply a revision of the customs partnership model that was rejected by the inner Brexit cabinet committee weeks ago.One senior Tory suggested that ""the party wouldn't wear it"". A senior Brexiteer minister said that a lot of the document was ""problematic"", and that there was a ""lot of scope for argument"". Essentially, for those who want a dramatic break with the EU, it falls far short, even though Number 10 insists it is merely an evolution of what the prime minister has already promised. Frankly, from what we have heard, language is doing a lot of the heavy lifting, with much of it ""opaque"". It does sketch out a relationship with the EU that is much tighter than Brexiteers had argued for. Would it really be Brexit? Number 10 would say yes, Jacob Rees Mogg would say no.For the rest of us? That depends what you think the country voted for. Tension around the meeting is high, with ministers being instructed in an email that they will have to hand in their phones and Apple watches on arrival at Chequers. Brexiteer ministers shared concerns at a meeting in the foreign secretary's office on Thursday night over the plan, with a source saying ""it's not going to fly"".  They said that they will ""simply reject it if she tries formally to impose it"". But another Brexiteer source said they would have to ""talk it out"" before coming to any conclusions about the plan.But a cabinet minister who has been pushing for a tight relationship with the EU told the BBC that while the plan was ""fiendishly complicated... no one had a better idea"".  A former cabinet minister who advocates closer ties to the EU told the BBC that they had urged the prime minister to consider sacking Brexiteers who refuse to sign up. They suggested that ""blood on the carpet"" might not be a bad thing. They said they believed the prime minister ""has had enough steel put in her spine"" to be able to command ministers to back her plan or carry out a reshuffle. There is however concern in the City, too, over the suggestion of giving up the prospect of a close deal on services to guarantee an end to free movement. One insider suggested that Chancellor Philip Hammond may try to ""wedge"" services back into the draft agreement on Friday. Sources on all sides of the argument suggest that it is too early to tell how the talks tomorrow will end. There are demands for ""significant redrafting"". The discussions start at around 10:00 BST and are expected to wrap up at about 22:00 BST.  Please upgrade your browserInsiders also suggest that with the EU likely to reject much of the plan, the real debate will focus on what to do if and when Brussels says no, with Brexiteers pushing a ""Canada plus"" model. Another cabinet minister told the BBC that even though the EU was unlikely to accept it straight off, the point of this week's talks was not to find a final agreement, but simply to ""start a conversation"" with Brussels so that vital talks on the future relationship can get going. Until now, the negotiations have focused on the withdrawal agreement - the divorce deal - with no formal engagements over the long-term arrangements. An outline of the political agreement on that deal is supposed to be in place by October. To have any hope of a genuine and substantial deal by the autumn, the prime minister needs Brussels to take her, and her approach, seriously. If she fails to get agreement, her ability to project the authority that's needed for that to happen will be seriously put into question.But if she pushes ahead with the plan she will have to face down a powerful and vocal wing in her party. Some of her colleagues might heave a huge sigh of relief, and think, ""about time too"". But her party, and the rest of us, have no way of knowing tonight if that decision - which would risk her leadership - is one she is really willing to take. "
2018-07-05,Submarine Phil,https://web.archive.org//web/20180706101631/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44736662,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWhen Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, described the Treasury as the ""heart of Remain"" he was only partially correct.When a Cabinet minister said directly to me when asked about relations with Philip Hammond, ""Well, he's a Remainer"", that person missed the target.Mr Hammond and the Treasury have long since given up on any idea that the UK can remain a member of the European Union.But, at heart, the most powerful department in government - and many forget that is still true despite the ""spreadsheet Phil"" dismissal of his critics - believes that the closest possible relationship with the European Union is the only way to reduce the potential of lasting economic damage to Britain post-Brexit.Whilst others such as Mr Johnson and David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, have dominated the headlines, the Treasury has played it differently.Submarine would be a good descriptor.Under the surface, the department has focused its most senior people on persuading departments across government of two things.First, that the economic and trading links between Britain and the rest of the EU are so deep and intractable that a sharp and irrevocable split would carry perilous risk.From that argument came agreement to a ""transition period"" following the UK's official departure from the EU next March.Second, that open economies such as Britain depend on goods being traded freely across borders and that the way to achieve this with the UK's biggest customer, the EU, was via some form of customs deal.From that argument came the ""facilitated customs arrangement"" the Cabinet is discussing at Chequers today.A system that ties the UK so closely to EU regulations and processes that free-trade deals with other counties, such as America, become difficult to the point of impossible.In its arguments for the softest of soft Brexits, the Treasury has had some allies.The first is not a person, but a thing - the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Only via close alignment with the EU can there be any hope that the border can be kept free of customs checks, a key requirement, given the Good Friday agreement, of both the UK government and the EU.The second is Greg Clark, the Business Secretary, who spoke yesterday of the need to listen ""with the greatest respect"" to companies such as Jaguar Land Rover when it said that billions of pounds of investment were at risk and jobs could be lost if barriers were suddenly thrown up between Britain and the EU.In his interview with me in Newcastle yesterday, Mr Clark also executed a subtle but significant change of language.Not that, when it came to goods, Britain would attempt a deal with the EU as friction free ""as possible"".But that it would attempt a deal that was friction free, period.That means some form of customs union on goods with the EU.Third is economic growth, which the Bank of England has said is up to two percentage points below where it was expected to be had Brexit uncertainty not weighed on business investment decisions and consumer spending power.The real world effects of the referendum, the Bank said, were ""material"".Of course, the Treasury has not yet ""won"" anything.The Cabinet has not agreed to the latest Brexit plan.Opponents of Mr Hammond's approach say that ""close alignment"" means the result of the referendum has not been respected and opportunities to exploit new global trade deals could be lost.The ""facilitated customs arrangement"" relies on technological gymnastics so intricate the systems do not yet exist and no other country in the world has attempted to follow a similar path.The European Union is wary of any deal that could be portrayed as giving Britain ""preferential treatment"".The ""having cake and eating it"" problem still remains.But, given that just over a year ago the headlines were talking of Theresa May's plans to sack the Chancellor, Mr Hammond will be at Chequers knowing that the Treasury's submarine approach appears to have secured at least the beach-head towards the softest of soft Brexits."
2018-07-05,Change in Wales,https://web.archive.org//web/20180706101631/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-44710380,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAll four major parties in the Welsh Assembly are facing leadership contests for one reason or another.  Here is a guide to the ""who, why, and when"".Why is there a contest? Carwyn Jones shocked the Welsh Labour conference in April when he announced he would step down as their leader and first minister at the end of the year.  He said he had been through ""the darkest of times"" - a reference to the death last November of Carl Sargeant, four days after Mr Jones sacked him as communities secretary. Who is in the running?Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford was first to declare, with backing from more than the minimum five AMs needed for the nomination.   Vaughan Gething, Eluned Morgan and Huw Irranca-Davies have also said they want to stand but unless the rules change on nominations not all of them will get onto the ballot paper.When will the winner be named?Welsh Labour will hold a special conference in September to decide the rules of the contest, amid debate over whether it should be one member one vote (OMOV) or an electoral college which gives more weight to the views of MPs, AMs and organisations such as trade unions.   The result is expected around early December, nine years to the month that Carwyn Jones took over from Rhodri Morgan.Why is there a contest?Neil Hamilton was ousted as leader of the five-strong UKIP group in May by Caroline Jones, who promised a more collaborative approach to Senedd politics.  The former Tory MP vowed to regain the group leadership, prompting UKIP HQ in London to step in and order a ballot of UKIP members in Wales to settle the row.Who is in the running?Neil Hamilton and Caroline Jones have both declared their intention to stand, along with Gareth Bennett, who has vowed to campaign to abolish the assembly.When will the winner be named?UKIP has said it expects to announce the result of the membership ballot by the end of July.Why is there a contest?Andrew RT Davies quit the leadership last Wednesday feeling he had lost the support of his colleagues.  He had been condemned within the party the previous Friday for accusing firms such as Airbus of undermining Brexit by voicing their concerns about the impact on trade.    But the ardent supporter of Brexit later told BBC Wales he had been aware of moves to unseat him for some time. Who is in the running?Interim leader Paul Davies has said he would like the job on a permanent basis, and Suzy Davies has also put her name forward.  While both backed Remain in the 2016 referendum on Europe, former Welsh Secretary David Jones has said the next assembly group leader should reflect what he called the ""overwhelmingly Eurosceptic"" views of grassroots members in Wales.When will the winner be named?A postal ballot of Welsh Conservative members will take place in August, and the result declared on 6 September. Why is there a contest?Plaid rules allow for a leadership contest every two years, and the window for a challenge closed on Wednesday.  Despite Leanne Wood's high profile in TV election debates in recent years, there has been unhappiness within party ranks at the apparent lack of progress in terms of AMs and MPs elected.   In June Ms Wood said she would welcome a contest and felt ""very"" confident of winning it.Who is in the running?Earlier in June Rhun ap Iorwerth said he had ""no plans"" to challenge Ms Wood, but has announced a bid saying she had invited a debate on Plaid's leadership and supporters had urged him to stand.  On Monday, Adam Price called on Ms Wood to share the leadership with a man to boost Plaid's fortunes or face the prospect of a challenge.  She turned the proposal down and Mr Price has now thrown his hat into the ring too.When will the winner be named?Plaid Cymru says it will announce a timetable shortly.The Welsh Lib Dems had a leadership election last November, when Jane Dodds beat Elizabeth Evans in a vote of the membership.   She took over from Mark Williams, the last remaining Welsh Lib Dem MP who stepped down after losing his Ceredigion seat at the 2017 general election.   With the sole Lib Dem AM Kirsty Williams serving in the Welsh Government as education secretary, the party changed its rules which previously said the Welsh leader had to be an AM or MP.    "

Have the voters they represent been able to decide what kind of Brexit they want?Two years after the UK narrowly voted to leave the European Union, ministers are working towards the withdrawal deadline of 29 March 2019 - despite reports that they are divided over what Brexit should look like.The debate - which has also seen arguments about whether there should be referendum on a final deal - is often presented as a choice between so-called ""hard"" and ""soft"" Brexit. These terms mean different things to different people - but a ""hard"" Brexit is generally taken to mean a significant change, with the UK leaving the EU single market and customs union, and no longer implementing EU freedom of movement rules.""Soft"" Brexit is often used to describe the UK keeping some kind of free trade arrangement with the EU, remaining in a customs union and allowing EU citizens to live and work in the UK. But where do the UK's voters, who remain more or less evenly divided on whether they support leaving the EU, stand on what the future relationship should be like post-Brexit? Please upgrade your browserTwo polling companies, Opinium and ORB International, have been tracking this issue since the referendum. The wording of their questions is important.Opinium asked voters: ""If it becomes apparent that we will not be able to have one without the other, which of the following should be the government's negotiating priority during the Brexit negotiations?  Staying in the single market even if it means allowing free movement of labour, or ending free movement of labour even if it means we leave the single market?""The first option refers to a ""soft"" Brexit, the second to a ""hard"" one.The graph below shows the average percentage choosing each answer at four key points since January 2017.Three things stand out. First, many voters find answering this question difficult - about a quarter continue to say they are not sure which would be the better choice. It may be some are struggling with what is meant by ""the single market"" or ""free movement"", while others would perhaps like to be able to do both.Second, there is no clear majority in favour of either option. Third, there seems to have been a slight - but only slight - tilt in favour of staying in the single market rather than ending free movement. The four-point advantage for staying in the single market contrasts with a five-point lead for ending free movement in a couple of polls that Opinium conducted in early 2017. But this is just one question from one company. And all pollsters know the answer they get often depends on how the question is posed. ORB has taken a different approach.Every month since November 2016, it has asked people to agree or disagree with the following proposition: ""Having greater control over immigration ['hard Brexit'] is more important than having access to free trade with the EU ['soft Brexit']."" The graph shows the average for all the polls conducted in five time periods.Voters evidently find ORB's question easier to answer, though as many as 15% still stay they don't know. Among those who do answer, slightly more say they back a hard Brexit - that is, they agree that controlling immigration is more important than free trade with the EU. There is no consistent evidence that this picture has changed during the past two years.However, ORB's data confirms Opinium's suggestion that the UK is split in its views about the kind of Brexit it would like to see.This is perhaps not surprising given that the country is still more or less evenly divided between Remain and Leave.In its recent polls, Opinium has found that, on average, about two-thirds of Remain voters (68%) prioritise staying in the single market, while three-fifths of Leave supporters (61%) feel it is more important to end free movement. The balance of opinion among Conservative and Labour supporters is rather different too. According to Opinium, 40% of Conservative supporters would prioritise ending free movement and only 20% staying in the single market. But among Labour supporters, the equivalent figures are 11% and 45% respectively. Some of the demographic divisions revealed by the 2016 referendum are repeated in the hard-v-soft debate too. ORB's recent polls suggest only 26% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 35% of 25- to 34-year-olds agree it is more important to control immigration than to secure access to free trade with the EU. In contrast, most of those aged 65 or over (56%) and 55- to 64-year-olds (53%) hold that view.Meanwhile, women (38%) are much more likely than men (16%) to say they are not sure whether the UK should stay in the single market, or end free movement.Another aspect of the hard-v-soft debate on which polling has been relatively scarce is whether or not the UK should stay in a customs union with the EU. But in the past couple of months, Opinium has asked people if they've heard about a customs union, and whether the government should try to stay in the EU customs union in order to prioritise EU trade or to leave it to allow the UK to grow its trade links with the rest of the world. On both occasions, more than a fifth said they had not heard of the customs union at all, while 16-17% said they didn't know what the government's priority should be. So, despite the heated debate the issue has recently generated at Westminster, it appears to have passed many voters by. Among those with a preference, public opinion is again more or less evenly divided, with 31-32% arguing the UK should stay in the customs union and 30% disagreeing. How Sweden is preparing for Russia to hack its electionLocal election results 2018: How important was the Brexit effect?Why politicians often row about taxThe six tribes that could shape Europe's futureSo, however the issue is addressed, two points stand out about public attitudes towards Brexit. First, many voters are not at all sure about what kind of Brexit they would like. Second, among those who do have a view, opinion is more or less evenly divided. This makes it very difficult for any politician to be sure how best to interpret the ""will of the people"" as expressed in the EU referendum. But that is the challenge that they face as the Brexit negotiations now move up a gear.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.John Curtice is professor of politics at Strathclyde University and research fellow at the NatCen Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.He is also chief commentator at WhatUKthinks.org.Edited by Jennifer Clarke"

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-05,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180706101631/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

Theresa May has said they have ""a duty"" to reach agreement on Friday, amid splits over how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit.She is expected to propose keeping the UK aligned with the EU on trading rules for goods but not services.An ex-minister warned that would mean ""something less than the full Brexit"".If ministers reach an agreement, the EU can then choose to accept or reject their proposals.Speaking on Friday, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""ready to adapt our offer should the UK's red lines change"" but insisted there could be no ""unravelling"" of the single market. Ministers are expected to be at Chequers, a 16th Century house in Buckinghamshire which is the PM's country residence, until about 22.00 GMT. They had to hand in their phones and any smartwatches on arrival. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the proposal would include a common rulebook on some sectors - like industrial goods and agricultural goods - for ""practical"" supply chain reasons.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm pretty confident we will end up with a concrete position which everybody is able to sign up to.""But Brexiteer ministers are understood to be unhappy. Seven cabinet ministers met at the Foreign Office on Thursday evening to discuss the proposal.There have also been suggestions that the prime minister's proposal would make a US trade deal more difficult. No 10 says it is ""categorically untrue that we will not be able to strike a trade deal with the US"".David Jones, a former minister at the Department for Exiting the EU, said Mrs May's proposal looked set to breach her ""red lines"" on leaving the customs union, single market and jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. BBC Political Editor Laura KuenssbergOften the hype about a political event is in inverse proportion to the drama of what actually comes to pass. Maybe not this time.To say that Brexiteer ministers are a bit miffed with Mrs May's plan, which they only received in its entirety on Thursday afternoon, is an understatement. There is plenty in there that they don't like, and it's easy to see why.Ahead of the meeting, Mrs May said the cabinet had ""a great opportunity - and a duty. To set an ambitious course to enhance our prosperity and security outside the European Union - and to build a country that genuinely works for everyone"".Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said a workable agreement that could be taken to the EU was needed and ""simply a truce in the cabinet was not good enough for Britain"". Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said time was running out for the UK and the worst outcome would be ministers emerging ""arm in arm, saying they've agreed, because that means there's another helping of fudge being served up and what is being put forward is likely to be rejected by Europe"". Meanwhile sources close to David Cameron confirmed the former PM met Boris Johnson on Thursday and discussed Brexit.But they said there was ""no grand view"" on the negotiations and disputed reports Mr Cameron had agreed that Theresa May's plan was the ""worst of all worlds"".There have been differing views within the cabinet about how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit, and what compromises should be made to achieve ""as frictionless as possible"" trade.The aim is to agree a UK proposal on how future relations should work on Friday, the details of which would then be published in a White Paper net week.That would then be the subject of negotiations with the EU - which might have different ideas.Ministers have yet to agree what they want to replace the UK's membership of the EU's customs union, which allows for tariff-free trading between members.One of the key issues is the need to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the UK is outside the customs union.The EU and UK say there can be no return to a hard border. But Eurosceptic MPs say tying the UK to the EU after it leaves will prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries.Meanwhile 46 other Conservative MPs have urged Mrs May to listen to the voice of business and target a deal which enables ""frictionless trade to continue"".Please upgrade your browserThe ""facilitated customs arrangement"" is understood to be a proposal for a post-Brexit customs agreement which would allow the UK the freedom to set its own tariffs on goods arriving into the country. Technology would be used to determine where the goods will ultimately end up - and therefore whether UK or EU tariffs should be paid.It would keep the UK aligned to EU regulations in some sectors- such as industrial and agricultural goods - but Parliament would be able to decide where to deviate.Details of how the plan would work in practice have yet to be published. But Downing Street says it is confident the arrangement would be partly in place by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020 - with the system being fully operational by the next general election, due in 2022.It is not clear whether the EU will agree to it.The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019. But to allow time for parliaments in the UK and the EU to approve whatever deal is agreed, the aim is for the framework for future relations to be agreed this autumn.But the UK government has not, as yet, settled on what its post-Brexit relationship with the EU should look like.EU leaders last week told Mrs May it was time to ""lay the cards on the table"" if a Brexit deal was to be done on time.Businesses, including Jaguar Land Rover, Airbus and BMW, have also been stepping up the pressure on the government to provide more detail."

The EU's chief negotiator said ""realistic and workable"" UK proposals are needed, as the cabinet meets at Chequers, for what happens post-Brexit. Theresa May is expected to propose keeping the UK aligned with the EU on trading rules for goods, not services.If the cabinet agree, proposals will then go to the EU.But Mr Barnier warned in a speech:  ""The single market is our main economic public good. There will be no damaging it, no unravelling what we have achieved together with the UK.""He also repeated warnings that time is running out to reach a deal. ""Time is short. We need to quickly have realistic and workable solutions and obviously we look forward to the UK's White Paper.""The UK's proposals will facilitate both the UK's internal political debate and negotiation with us.""Our objective has always been to find an agreement with the UK, not against the UK.""Talks with the EU continue over the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU in March next year. What happens to the Irish border remains a sticking point.Both sides want a deal to be reached by the next European Council meeting in October.Mr Barnier also said there was a need to ""de-dramatise"" the issue of the ""backstop"" - the EU's proposal to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, if the EU and UK cannot agree new arrangements in time.Under the EU's proposals ""a limited set of EU rules would continue to apply in Northern Ireland as they do today"", Mr Barnier said in a speech."

Although classed as a working trip rather than a state visit, the president will be greeted with a military ceremony in the Great Court, with the bands of the Scots, Irish and Welsh Guards playing the Liberty Fanfare, Amazing Grace and the National Emblem. Invited guests, including a number of business leaders, will eat dinner to the sounds of the Countess of Wessex's Orchestra, which will play a ""series of classic British and American hits"", according to Mrs May's deputy spokeswoman. Mr Trump, whose mother was Scottish, will then be piped out at the end by the Royal Regiment of Scotland.After spending the night at Winfield House in London, hosted by his ambassador Robert Johnson, the president will join the prime minister to watch a UK military exercise, before the pair travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for bilateral talks. The president and first lady will then travel to Windsor to meet the Queen on Friday afternoon. On the final leg of the tour, the couple will fly to Scotland, where they plan to spend the weekend. Thousands are expected to protest in London on Thursday and Friday against the president's visit.London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit.Others are holding marches through the city and in Scotland - where President Trump owns golf courses.

2018-07-06,Airbus: Ministers have 'no clue' on Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180706153405/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44735505,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe chief executive of planemaker Airbus has accused the government of having no idea how to take the UK out of the EU without damaging the country.Tom Enders said it ""still has no clue, or at least no consensus, on how to execute Brexit without severe harm"".He was speaking as ministers prepare to meet at the prime minister's country residence to agree a blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU.Airbus is taking steps to mitigate the impact of Brexit, Mr Enders said.""Brexit in any form, soft or hard, light or clean - whatever you call it - will be damaging,"" he added.A government spokesperson said it was confident of reaching a good Brexit deal, adding: ""We do not expect a no-deal scenario to arise.""Mr Enders' comments follow a warning given last month that Airbus could leave the UK if the country leaves the single market and customs union without a transition deal.At the time, the company said: ""This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country.""Airbus makes wings for the A320, A330/A340, A350 and A380 passenger planes in the UK and has 14,000 staff.By Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondentTom Enders made his comments in a light-hearted fashion - with a reference to England and France potentially facing each other in the World Cup final thrown in. But the message was deadly serious. The gloves have come off.It seems Airbus has lost patience with what it perceives as government infighting, and is demanding at least a degree of clarity over what the future will bring. In June, the European aerospace giant warned that a hard Brexit could force it to reconsider its investments in the UK. That produced a slap-down from the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who said its ""threats"" were ""completely inappropriate"".In response, Mr Enders pointed out today that if there was one company that made its voice heard, not only in London but in European capitals as well, it was Airbus. No plans to stay quiet then - and so a forthright message was delivered just as ministers gathered ahead of that oh-so-important meeting at Chequers.Airbus said the current planned transition period, due to end in December 2020, was too short for it to make changes to its supply chain.Mr Enders said he had a duty to Airbus shareholders to speak up: ""We have been very clear about what the consequences particularly of a hard Brexit would be."" His comments are the latest warning on Brexit by big business. On Thursday, Jaguar Land Rover - the UK's biggest carmaker - said a ""bad"" Brexit deal could force it to close factories and would threaten £80bn of investment plans for the UK."

The code states that ""anti-Semitism is racism. It is unacceptable in our party and in wider society"".But some critics think it does not sign up in full to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition of anti-Semitism.Labour insists it does meet the full IHRA definition, which it says was adopted by the party in December 2016.Labour MPs Chuka Umunna, Liz Kendall and Anna Turley are among those who have been critical.Mr Umunna tweeted he was ""utterly appalled"":Our values dictate that we treat all groups the same and yet, again and again, we see examples of the Jewish community being treated differently to other groups by the Labour Party.

It does endorse the IHRA's working definition of anti-Semitism and includes behaviours it lists as likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics think it leaves out four examples: However, Labour insisted the examples which are not in the bulleted section are addressed in the guidelines.In their joint statement, Jonathan Goldstein of the Jewish Leadership Council and Marie van der Zyl of the Board of Deputies said it was ""for Jews to determine themselves what anti-Semitism is"".The Labour Against Anti-Semitism campaign described it as a ""toothless document"" adding: ""The Labour Party already has very little credibility left as the anti-racist body it has always claimed to be. ""The formal adoption of this document would see any remaining credibility lost, perhaps permanently.""A Labour source said Labour Against Anti-Semitism's claims were ""ludicrous and entirely false"".And a spokesman for the Labour Party said: ""These are the most detailed and comprehensive guidelines on anti-Semitism adopted by any political party in this country.""They draw on the IHRA examples and other sources to provide practical examples of anti-Semitism which can be applied to complaints cases and used in political education programmes to foster deeper understanding of anti-Semitism among members.""Mr Umunna and Ms Turley are not the only Labour MPs to criticise the code. Bassetlaw MP John Mann tweeted:The Macpherson definition of racism has been accepted until now by every mainstream political party in Parliament. The Labour NEC are the first to refuse to accept it, which has huge consequences. https://t.co/U3IZVcCXOkEnd of Twitter post  by @JohnMannMPWhile Leicester West MP Liz Kendall said on Twitter:IHRA definition of anti semitism is used by U.K, Scottish & Welsh Govts, 124 local councils & Crown Prosecution Service.

Mark Carney said recent data had given him ""greater confidence"" that weak first-quarter growth ""was largely due to the weather"". He said household spending and sentiment had ""bounced back strongly"".England winning the World Cup would be an ""unalloyed, unadulterated absolute good"" for the economy, Mr Carney added.In a speech at the Northern Powerhouse Summit in Newcastle, Mr Carney said: ""Overall, recent domestic data suggest the economy is evolving largely in line with the May Inflation Report projections, which see demand growing at rates slightly above those of supply and domestic cost pressures building.""The pound edged up 0.2% against the dollar to $1.3254 following his remarks.Last month, three members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee - including chief economist Andy Haldane - voted in favour of lifting the interest rate to 0.75%. Mr Carney was among the six MPC members who voted to keep rates on hold at 0.5%.  He also warned that a global trade war could dampen economic growth.Mr Carney said ""protectionist rhetoric"" was rising and was now turning into action: ""There are some, tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity.""He cited evidence from the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI), which suggested that global export orders and manufacturing output have fallen back from highs at the start of the year.On Friday, the US will implement a 25% import tariff on a list of hundreds of Chinese goods. On the same day, China will also impose 25% tariffs on a range of US goods, including pork products, fish and rice. In a Q&A session after his speech, Mr Carney - who was wearing a Three Lions lapel badge - was asked about the economic impact of an England win.""It would be an unalloyed, unadulterated absolute good. Everything would be good,"" he replied.The Bank governor also praised the England team's work ethic, humility and its innovation, adding: ""This is a pleasure to watch right now, so we are all behind them.""When the event host said ""In Gareth we trust"", Mr Carney quipped: ""I will get my waistcoat this afternoon."""

Charlie Rowley, 45, and Dawn Sturgess, 44, collapsed at a house in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on Saturday and remain critically ill.Home secretary Sajid Javid said the nerve agent was the same as that used on ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in March.Russia said Theresa May's government was subjecting them ""to hell"".Mr Javid accused Russia of using Britain as a ""dumping ground for poison"" after the second incident involving the nerve agent.But a Russian Embassy spokesman said all allegations of the country's involvement were ""merely speculative"". The Met said there were around 100 detectives from the Counter Terrorism Network working alongside Wiltshire Police on the ""major incident"". Salisbury District Hospital's chief executive Cara Charles-Barks said the couple are ""extremely unwell"" and remain in a critical condition. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said that because the highest concentration of Novichok was found on the couple's hands, police believe the item they handled could be a container or receptacle that was used to carry the nerve agent.He said the most likely hypothesis is that the Novichok was left over from an item discarded after the attack on the Skripals. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said there was nothing in the couple's background to suggest the pair had been targeted.The BBC's home affairs correspondent June Kelly said it has been suggested the item ""could be a vial or syringe because of the couple's lifestyle"". Chemical weapons expert Richard Guthrie said it was possible that the couple came across the Novichok after it had been disposed of ""in a haphazard way"".Debbie Stark, south west deputy director from Public Health England said the risk to the public of further poisoning incidents ""remains low"".Police have set up a helpline for anyone who needs further advice: 0800 092 0410 or 0207 158 0124.In a statement to MPs, Mr Javid said: ""It is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on.""He said the ""strong working assumption"" was that the couple came into contact with Novichok in a location which had not been cleaned up following the Skripal poisoning in nearby Salisbury.""It is completely unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns, to be dumping grounds for poison,"" he added.He said he could not rule out the possibility that the Novichok found in Amesbury was from the same batch used in the Salisbury attack and that scientists would be ""looking into that"".Earlier, Mrs May said it was ""deeply disturbing"" to see two more people exposed to Novichok in the UK, and the police would leave ""no stone unturned in their investigation"".Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said British streets must not be allowed to become ""killing fields for state actors"".But the spokesman for the Russian Embassy said the government had yet to contact them about the incidentHe added: ""Instead of genuine co-operation, London is doing everything possible to muddy the waters, to confuse and frighten its own citizens. ""One can only guess what the reasons behind such a line of behaviour are."" Ms Sturgess' father Stephen, 65, told The Times the family found out from TV news that she may have been poisoned by a nerve agent.""We heard from the hospital on Sunday, and we gave them Dawn's GP details but we didn't hear anything from the police.""We know as much as the next person in the street. We actually called the police station for information.""Natalie Smyth from Amesbury said: ""I'm furious that it took four days for them [the police] to even mention it could have been Novichock."" ""Were they lying to us about it being drug related?""Although the risk to the public remains low, Public Health England (PHE) have advised those who were in the areas from 22:00 BST on Friday and which are now cordoned off to wash their clothes and wipe down personal items.Clothing that cannot be washed should be double-bagged and owners should await ""further instructions"".Debbie Stark from PHE said areas of Salisbury that have already been cleaned as part of the Skripal incident - such as the Maltings shopping centre - are safe.Residents at John Baker House, the supported housing where Ms Sturgess is believed to have been staying, have been evacuated and told they will have to be rehoused.The police warned members of the public against picking up unfamiliar items.Sites in Amesbury and Salisbury believed to have been visited by the couple before they fell ill have been cordoned off as a precaution, including a church, park and chemist.This latest incident is likely to raise fears about the efficiency of  the multimillion pound clean-up to decontaminate nine locations across Salisbury after the Skripal poisoning.The revelation that two more people have been exposed to the nerve agent Novichock has shocked people in Salisbury. Residents have experienced months of disruption and anxiety since the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March. Now many are wondering whether, despite a clean-up operation, their city is safe?Read more hereThere have been accusations from Russia that the UK is persecuting the country and failing to co-operate.The Skripal case is still shrouded in darkness, says Russia spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, as she called on Theresa May's government to stop the ""dirty"" games.She said Russia has sent ""dozens of offers of co-operation"" and she was confident London would have to apologise to her country.Are you in the area?

2018-07-06,Labour wants McVey to quit over comments,https://web.archive.org//web/20180706153405/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44723227,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEsther McVey has faced calls to quit over ""inadvertently misleading"" the Commons about the official NAO spending watchdog's view of Universal Credit.Labour said the work and pensions secretary either ""misread"" or ""chose to misrepresent"" the NAO report and ""either way, she should resign"". Ms McVey said she would meet the NAO boss on Monday and again apologised for ""the phrasing of the words"" she used. But she insisted that Universal Credit was helping people get into employment.For the second successive day in the Commons she stood by her claim that the NAO (National Audit Office) report on Universal Credit did not take into account the latest developments, saying that changes made earlier this year had not fed through during the period covered, which was to April this year.The head of the NAO - Sir Amyas Morse - took the unusual step on Wednesday of publicly writing to Ms McVey to take issue with how she had responded to the report on Monday.Among the issues he raised, he said: ""I'm afraid your statement that the NAO was concerned Universal Credit is currently 'rolling but too slowly' and needs to 'continue at a faster rate' is also not correct. ""While we recognise regrettable early delays, my recommendation made clearly on page 11 of the report is the department must now ensure it is ready before it starts to transfer people over from previous benefits.""Ms McVey apologised for her wording on this point when she appeared in the Commons on Wednesday, and again on Thursday.She explained her error to MPs by saying the report had said there was ""no practical alternative"" to Universal Credit and that it had also said it regretted the slow pace of its roll-out, so she had taken that to mean the NAO was recommending it be speeded up.She added: ""If people know me they will always say about me I am open and I am straight and I will say it is as it is.""Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""The secretary of state should be ashamed she has been forced to come to this House again.""Why and how did she come to say falsely over two separate occasions in this Parliament that the NAO report said the roll-out of Universal Credit should be speeded up?""How can these statements be inadvertent  slips of the tongue? Has she ever read the NAO report? If she has, how can she draw the conclusions that she has? If she misread these reports so badly, this brings into question her competence and her judgement. ""If she did the read the report and chose to misrepresent its findings, she has clearly broken the ministerial code. Either way, she should resign."" In the report published last month, the NAO said the government's flagship benefits system was not delivering value for money and could end up costing more to administer than the benefits system it is replacing. It warned some claimants switching to Universal Credit, which rolls six working-age benefits into one, had waited eight months to be paid. While the report noted that the Department for Work and Pensions did ""not accept"" that Universal Credit had caused hardship among claimants, it pointed to a recent internal departmental report that showed 40% of claimants were experiencing financial difficulties.Universal Credit merges six benefits (income support; income-based jobseeker's allowance; income-related employment and support allowance; housing benefit; child tax credit; working tax credit) into one.It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler. A single payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover the benefits for which they are eligible.Claimants then have to pay costs, such as rent, out of their UC payment. It can be claimed by people whether they are in or out of work - but payment decreases as you earn more.SNP frontbencher Alison Thewliss said the NAO report ""blows a hole as wide as the Clyde through everything the Tories have been saying"" on Universal Credit.Labour MP Meg Hillier asked Ms McVey to confirm that she had confidence in the NAO, with the minister replying that ""they do their job"".Ms McVey said her department believed Universal Credit would bring a £34bn benefit to the UK economy over the next 10 years and a 200,000 increase in employment.She said that Labour had predicted that a million more people would be unemployed if Universal Credit was brought in, but actually millions more people were in work and she added: ""I have never asked Labour to apologise for their misleading figures.""Universal Credit is currently available in 353 job centres and the government says it is ""on track"" to be rolled out to all job centres nationally by the end of 2018.In her 2 July statement, Ms McVey said 83% of claimants who responded had said they were satisfied with customer service.

As they met in Berlin, Mrs Merkel said Brexit talks were at a ""crucial phase"".She said that a political framework for future relations needed to be clear by October.Downing Street said Theresa May and Angela Merkel had ""constructive"" talks about Brexit in Berlin and the cabinet's discussions at Chequers would decide a ""substantial way forward which would enable the pace and intensity of negotiations to increase"".Meanwhile Brexiteer ministers including Boris Johnson, David Davis, Michael Gove, Liam Fox and Esther McVey were holding talks on Thursday evening, ahead of the meeting on Friday.David Davis just leaving Downing St- McVey, Johnson, Fox, Leadsom and Gove all apparently in meeting in FCOEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakThe two leaders' meeting came as Downing Street set out some of the detail of its new proposal for how trade between the UK and the EU could be handled after Brexit.There are differing views within the cabinet about how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit, and what compromises should be made to achieve ""as frictionless as possible"" trade.After months of tension and disagreement, the prime minster is gathering the entire cabinet at her country retreat, Chequers, with the aim of agreeing a UK proposal on how future relations with the EU will work.That would then be the subject of negotiations with the EU - which might have different ideas.The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019. But to allow time for parliaments in the UK and the EU to approve whatever deal is agreed, the aim is for the framework for future relations to be agreed this autumn. According to No 10, the new plan would allow the UK the freedom to set its own tariffs on goods arriving into the country.Technology would be used to determine where the goods will ultimately end up - and therefore whether UK or EU tariffs should be paid.Downing Street says it is confident the arrangement would be partly in place by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020 - with the system being fully operational by the next general election, which is due in 2022.On regulations, it is understood that the UK would closely mirror the EU's rules - but Parliament would be able to decide where to deviate. However, the arrangement has not been explained in full - and it is not clear whether the cabinet will back the plan, or whether the EU would agree.A source close to Brexit Secretary David Davis refused to comment on a Daily Telegraph report that he had already told Mrs May the plan was unworkable.Mr Davis and Mrs May were ""working closely on what will be presented on Friday"", the source said.However Mr Davis is expected to ""forcefully"" express his doubts and reservations about the compromise plan, including the view that it could be a mistake to set out too much of the UK's negotiating position at this stagePlease upgrade your browserAmong the issues that need to be resolved is the need to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the UK is outside the customs union.Eurosceptic MPs have warned Mrs May against tying the UK to the EU after it leaves, saying this will prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. Meanwhile 46 other Conservative MPs have written to Mrs May urging her to listen to the voice of business and target a deal which enables ""frictionless trade to continue"".After Friday's meeting, the government is expected to publish a White Paper setting out its plans in detail.The European Union asked a series of questions about the UK's previous customs proposals and they are still relevant. Will it be temporary? Does it solve the Irish border issue fully or partly? Does it respect the integrity of EU customs policy? How is it supervised? How will the UK system evolve as the EU's does? Will the EU need to change its trade policy? But customs is only a fraction of the relationship between the UK and the EU and so the British idea of aligning to some European regulations is a much bigger deal. And the priority in Brussels is to find a solution to the Northern Irish border. ""If there isn't a deal on that then things could turn nasty quite quickly,"" a diplomat told me. The EU is waiting to see the full White Paper. Officials from the 27 remaining countries are primed to meet soon after it is published and ministers will give their reaction at a meeting on 20 July but civil servants in Brussels expect to be combing through it until the end of the month at least.

2018-07-06,Jaguar boss: Brexit threatens investment,https://web.archive.org//web/20180706153405/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44719656,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJaguar Land Rover has warned that a ""bad"" Brexit deal would threaten £80bn worth of investment plans for the UK and may force it to close factories. The UK's biggest carmaker, owned by India's Tata Motors, said its ""heart and soul is in the UK"".But without frictionless trade JLR said its UK investment plans would be in jeopardy.The warning came as Downing Street set out details of a possible post-Brexit customs arrangement.Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Ralf Speth said: ""A bad Brexit deal would cost Jaguar Land Rover more than £1.2bn profit each year.""As a result, we would have to drastically adjust our spending profile. We have spent around £50bn in the UK in the past five years - with plans for a further £80bn more in the next five.""This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome.""Mr Speth said the firm urgently needs ""greater certainty"" to continue to investing heavily in the UK.He told the Financial Times: ""If I'm forced to go out because we don't have the right deal, then we have to close plants here in the UK and it will be very, very sad. This is hypothetical, and I hope it's an option we never have to go for.""Uncertainty over Brexit, as well as the future of diesel cars, has already led the carmaker to announce a series of changes to its UK business.At the beginning of the year, JLR said it would cut production at its plant in Halewood, Merseyside where it builds three of its Range Rover models.In April, it decided not to renew the contracts for 1,000 temporary workers in Solihull. Last month, JLR said it would shift production of the Land Rover Discovery SUV to Slovakia, potentially leading to some UK job losses.However, the carmaker also said that it was investing in its Solihull site to allow it to build its new Range Rover models, some of which will be electric-powered, from 2020.PB Balaji, chief financial officer at Tata Motors, said: ""Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Motors have always maintained that the uncertainties from Brexit are avoidable and the business seeks clarity to ensure that industry takes timely and right decisions to manage the transition.""Additionally, Jaguar Land Rover needs free and full access to the single market beyond transition to remain competitive which we also firmly believe is in the best long term interests of the United Kingdom.""The recent statement from JLR only reaffirms this position that a Brexit which increases bureaucracy, reduces productivity and competitiveness of the UK industry is in no-one's interest.""As well as Halewood and Solihull, JLR also has a manufacturing plant in Castle Bromwich, Birmingham where it makes its Jaguar cars.Last year, it made more than 600,000 cars, 20% of which were sold to mainland Europe, one of its biggest markets.JLR said that it spent £5.67bn with UK suppliers of production parts during its last financial year, as well as £5.37bn with EU-based businesses.Simon Jack, BBC business editorJLR may be Indian-owned, but its brand and - as the company puts it - its heart and soul is in the UK.It employs 40,000 people directly and 260,000 work in its supply chain. JLR's warning follows those of Airbus, BMW and Nissan who have all said further investment in the UK is ""under review"" and could be cancelled if the country leaves the EU without a deal that ensures frictionless trade. JLR insiders say £80bn worth of future investment in the UK over the next five years ""could be lost"".The intervention of such a major employer - which in many ways is rightly perceived as more British than the likes of BMW, Airbus and Nissan - will heap more pressure on the government ahead of a crunch meeting of government ministers on Friday. At this meeting, business hopes the government will finally settle on its own preferred version of the UK's future economic relationship with its largest market. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the government was ""determined"" to make sure JLR could ""continue to prosper and invest in Britain"".The Jaguar Land Rover warning follows similar statements from BMW and Airbus. However, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called these warnings ""completely inappropriate"".JLR is a great British success story. We are determined to make sure that it can continue to prosper and to invest in Britain. https://t.co/DQ5lSpM2obEnd of Twitter post  by @GregClarkMPMeanwhile, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) has warned in a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier that failure to reach an agreement to ensure frictionless trade will  result in customs delays for perishable goods. The BRC says that a third of the food consumed in the UK is imported from the EU."

2018-07-06,Day of drama,https://web.archive.org//web/20180706153405/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44733802,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowOften the hype about a political event is in inverse proportion to the drama of what actually comes to pass. Maybe not this time. Cabinet ministers will today meet at Chequers with the aim of approving the prime minister's blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit. But Brexiteer ministers have warned that the 120-page plan as written is flawed. They were discussing late on Thursday how to respond during the cabinet meeting. And to say that they are a bit miffed with the plan, which they only received in its entirety on Thursday afternoon, is an understatement. There is plenty in there that they don't like, and it's easy to see why. The BBC understands that the plan includes:The paper also suggests that, while trade deals with other countries like the US would be possible, they might be harder to do because under rules agreed with the EU, it would be harder to meet other countries' ""asks"". One cabinet minister also expressed unhappiness with the proposed customs model - the facilitated customs arrangement - saying that it was like ""customs partnership minus"" - simply a revision of the customs partnership model that was rejected by the inner Brexit cabinet committee weeks ago.One senior Tory suggested that ""the party wouldn't wear it"". A senior Brexiteer minister said that a lot of the document was ""problematic"", and that there was a ""lot of scope for argument"". Essentially, for those who want a dramatic break with the EU, it falls far short, even though Number 10 insists it is merely an evolution of what the prime minister has already promised. Frankly, from what we have heard, language is doing a lot of the heavy lifting, with much of it ""opaque"". It does sketch out a relationship with the EU that is much tighter than Brexiteers had argued for. Would it really be Brexit? Number 10 would say yes, Jacob Rees Mogg would say no.For the rest of us? That depends what you think the country voted for. Tension around the meeting is high, with ministers being instructed in an email that they will have to hand in their phones and Apple watches on arrival at Chequers. Brexiteer ministers shared concerns at a meeting in the foreign secretary's office on Thursday night over the plan, with a source saying ""it's not going to fly"".  They said that they will ""simply reject it if she tries formally to impose it"". But another Brexiteer source said they would have to ""talk it out"" before coming to any conclusions about the plan.But a cabinet minister who has been pushing for a tight relationship with the EU told the BBC that while the plan was ""fiendishly complicated... no one had a better idea"".  A former cabinet minister who advocates closer ties to the EU told the BBC that they had urged the prime minister to consider sacking Brexiteers who refuse to sign up. They suggested that ""blood on the carpet"" might not be a bad thing. They said they believed the prime minister ""has had enough steel put in her spine"" to be able to command ministers to back her plan or carry out a reshuffle. There is however concern in the City, too, over the suggestion of giving up the prospect of a close deal on services to guarantee an end to free movement. One insider suggested that Chancellor Philip Hammond may try to ""wedge"" services back into the draft agreement on Friday. Sources on all sides of the argument suggest that it is too early to tell how the talks tomorrow will end. There are demands for ""significant redrafting"". The discussions start at around 10:00 BST and are expected to wrap up at about 22:00 BST.  Please upgrade your browserInsiders also suggest that with the EU likely to reject much of the plan, the real debate will focus on what to do if and when Brussels says no, with Brexiteers pushing a ""Canada plus"" model. Another cabinet minister told the BBC that even though the EU was unlikely to accept it straight off, the point of this week's talks was not to find a final agreement, but simply to ""start a conversation"" with Brussels so that vital talks on the future relationship can get going. Until now, the negotiations have focused on the withdrawal agreement - the divorce deal - with no formal engagements over the long-term arrangements. An outline of the political agreement on that deal is supposed to be in place by October. To have any hope of a genuine and substantial deal by the autumn, the prime minister needs Brussels to take her, and her approach, seriously. If she fails to get agreement, her ability to project the authority that's needed for that to happen will be seriously put into question.But if she pushes ahead with the plan she will have to face down a powerful and vocal wing in her party. Some of her colleagues might heave a huge sigh of relief, and think, ""about time too"". But her party, and the rest of us, have no way of knowing tonight if that decision - which would risk her leadership - is one she is really willing to take. "

2018-07-06,Change in Wales,https://web.archive.org//web/20180706153405/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-44710380,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAll four major parties in the Welsh Assembly are facing leadership contests for one reason or another.  Here is a guide to the ""who, why, and when"".Why is there a contest? Carwyn Jones shocked the Welsh Labour conference in April when he announced he would step down as their leader and first minister at the end of the year.  He said he had been through ""the darkest of times"" - a reference to the death last November of Carl Sargeant, four days after Mr Jones sacked him as communities secretary. Who is in the running?Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford was first to declare, with backing from more than the minimum five AMs needed for the nomination.   Vaughan Gething, Eluned Morgan and Huw Irranca-Davies have also said they want to stand but unless the rules change on nominations not all of them will get onto the ballot paper.When will the winner be named?Welsh Labour will hold a special conference in September to decide the rules of the contest, amid debate over whether it should be one member one vote (OMOV) or an electoral college which gives more weight to the views of MPs, AMs and organisations such as trade unions.   The result is expected around early December, nine years to the month that Carwyn Jones took over from Rhodri Morgan.Why is there a contest?Neil Hamilton was ousted as leader of the five-strong UKIP group in May by Caroline Jones, who promised a more collaborative approach to Senedd politics.  The former Tory MP vowed to regain the group leadership, prompting UKIP HQ in London to step in and order a ballot of UKIP members in Wales to settle the row.Who is in the running?Neil Hamilton and Caroline Jones have both declared their intention to stand, along with Gareth Bennett, who has vowed to campaign to abolish the assembly.When will the winner be named?UKIP has said it expects to announce the result of the membership ballot by the end of July.Why is there a contest?Andrew RT Davies quit the leadership last Wednesday feeling he had lost the support of his colleagues.  He had been condemned within the party the previous Friday for accusing firms such as Airbus of undermining Brexit by voicing their concerns about the impact on trade.    But the ardent supporter of Brexit later told BBC Wales he had been aware of moves to unseat him for some time. Who is in the running?Interim leader Paul Davies has said he would like the job on a permanent basis, and Suzy Davies has also put her name forward.  While both backed Remain in the 2016 referendum on Europe, former Welsh Secretary David Jones has said the next assembly group leader should reflect what he called the ""overwhelmingly Eurosceptic"" views of grassroots members in Wales.When will the winner be named?A postal ballot of Welsh Conservative members will take place in August, and the result declared on 6 September. Why is there a contest?Plaid rules allow for a leadership contest every two years, and the window for a challenge closed on Wednesday.  Despite Leanne Wood's high profile in TV election debates in recent years, there has been unhappiness within party ranks at the apparent lack of progress in terms of AMs and MPs elected.   In June Ms Wood said she would welcome a contest and felt ""very"" confident of winning it.Who is in the running?Earlier in June Rhun ap Iorwerth said he had ""no plans"" to challenge Ms Wood, but has announced a bid saying she had invited a debate on Plaid's leadership and supporters had urged him to stand.  On Monday, Adam Price called on Ms Wood to share the leadership with a man to boost Plaid's fortunes or face the prospect of a challenge.  She turned the proposal down and Mr Price has now thrown his hat into the ring too.When will the winner be named?Plaid Cymru says it will announce a timetable shortly.The Welsh Lib Dems had a leadership election last November, when Jane Dodds beat Elizabeth Evans in a vote of the membership.   She took over from Mark Williams, the last remaining Welsh Lib Dem MP who stepped down after losing his Ceredigion seat at the 2017 general election.   With the sole Lib Dem AM Kirsty Williams serving in the Welsh Government as education secretary, the party changed its rules which previously said the Welsh leader had to be an AM or MP.    "
2018-07-06,Hard or soft?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180706153405/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44532288,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA ""make-or-break"" meeting on the UK's future relationship with the European Union will be held by ministers this week. Have the voters they represent been able to decide what kind of Brexit they want?Two years after the UK narrowly voted to leave the European Union, ministers are working towards the withdrawal deadline of 29 March 2019 - despite reports that they are divided over what Brexit should look like.The debate - which has also seen arguments about whether there should be referendum on a final deal - is often presented as a choice between so-called ""hard"" and ""soft"" Brexit. These terms mean different things to different people - but a ""hard"" Brexit is generally taken to mean a significant change, with the UK leaving the EU single market and customs union, and no longer implementing EU freedom of movement rules.""Soft"" Brexit is often used to describe the UK keeping some kind of free trade arrangement with the EU, remaining in a customs union and allowing EU citizens to live and work in the UK. But where do the UK's voters, who remain more or less evenly divided on whether they support leaving the EU, stand on what the future relationship should be like post-Brexit? Please upgrade your browserTwo polling companies, Opinium and ORB International, have been tracking this issue since the referendum. The wording of their questions is important.Opinium asked voters: ""If it becomes apparent that we will not be able to have one without the other, which of the following should be the government's negotiating priority during the Brexit negotiations?  Staying in the single market even if it means allowing free movement of labour, or ending free movement of labour even if it means we leave the single market?""The first option refers to a ""soft"" Brexit, the second to a ""hard"" one.The graph below shows the average percentage choosing each answer at four key points since January 2017.Three things stand out. First, many voters find answering this question difficult - about a quarter continue to say they are not sure which would be the better choice. It may be some are struggling with what is meant by ""the single market"" or ""free movement"", while others would perhaps like to be able to do both.Second, there is no clear majority in favour of either option. Third, there seems to have been a slight - but only slight - tilt in favour of staying in the single market rather than ending free movement. The four-point advantage for staying in the single market contrasts with a five-point lead for ending free movement in a couple of polls that Opinium conducted in early 2017. But this is just one question from one company. And all pollsters know the answer they get often depends on how the question is posed. ORB has taken a different approach.Every month since November 2016, it has asked people to agree or disagree with the following proposition: ""Having greater control over immigration ['hard Brexit'] is more important than having access to free trade with the EU ['soft Brexit']."" The graph shows the average for all the polls conducted in five time periods.Voters evidently find ORB's question easier to answer, though as many as 15% still stay they don't know. Among those who do answer, slightly more say they back a hard Brexit - that is, they agree that controlling immigration is more important than free trade with the EU. There is no consistent evidence that this picture has changed during the past two years.However, ORB's data confirms Opinium's suggestion that the UK is split in its views about the kind of Brexit it would like to see.This is perhaps not surprising given that the country is still more or less evenly divided between Remain and Leave.In its recent polls, Opinium has found that, on average, about two-thirds of Remain voters (68%) prioritise staying in the single market, while three-fifths of Leave supporters (61%) feel it is more important to end free movement. The balance of opinion among Conservative and Labour supporters is rather different too. According to Opinium, 40% of Conservative supporters would prioritise ending free movement and only 20% staying in the single market. But among Labour supporters, the equivalent figures are 11% and 45% respectively. Some of the demographic divisions revealed by the 2016 referendum are repeated in the hard-v-soft debate too. ORB's recent polls suggest only 26% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 35% of 25- to 34-year-olds agree it is more important to control immigration than to secure access to free trade with the EU. In contrast, most of those aged 65 or over (56%) and 55- to 64-year-olds (53%) hold that view.Meanwhile, women (38%) are much more likely than men (16%) to say they are not sure whether the UK should stay in the single market, or end free movement.Another aspect of the hard-v-soft debate on which polling has been relatively scarce is whether or not the UK should stay in a customs union with the EU. But in the past couple of months, Opinium has asked people if they've heard about a customs union, and whether the government should try to stay in the EU customs union in order to prioritise EU trade or to leave it to allow the UK to grow its trade links with the rest of the world. On both occasions, more than a fifth said they had not heard of the customs union at all, while 16-17% said they didn't know what the government's priority should be. So, despite the heated debate the issue has recently generated at Westminster, it appears to have passed many voters by. Among those with a preference, public opinion is again more or less evenly divided, with 31-32% arguing the UK should stay in the customs union and 30% disagreeing. How Sweden is preparing for Russia to hack its electionLocal election results 2018: How important was the Brexit effect?Why politicians often row about taxThe six tribes that could shape Europe's futureSo, however the issue is addressed, two points stand out about public attitudes towards Brexit. First, many voters are not at all sure about what kind of Brexit they would like. Second, among those who do have a view, opinion is more or less evenly divided. This makes it very difficult for any politician to be sure how best to interpret the ""will of the people"" as expressed in the EU referendum. But that is the challenge that they face as the Brexit negotiations now move up a gear.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.John Curtice is professor of politics at Strathclyde University and research fellow at the NatCen Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.He is also chief commentator at WhatUKthinks.org.Edited by Jennifer Clarke"

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-06,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180706153405/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

The cabinet meeting on Friday to get the grumpy group on board with Theresa May's plan for Brexit ran a little longer than her team had hoped, by 40 minutes. But now they are cock-a-hoop over what they achieved. Tensions in the Tory Party over Europe are still profound. But the Brexiteers were subdued with some neat Whitehall manoeuvring, and strong political arguments in preparation. Ministers this week received one paper explaining why a Canada-style trade deal couldn't work because it wouldn't prevent an Irish hard border. Another then about why the Norway model, the European Economic Area, couldn't work. A third paper too explaining how leaving with no deal might cause such an economic upset, that the Tories would be punished for a generation. Then finally late on Thursday before the meeting - ta dah! - a paper proposing the magic solution, well at least the prime minister's compromise. That layering of arguments was repeated in real life by the sessions on Friday at Chequers. Experts (they're back apparently) from government explained the problems with the models, and answered questions from the floor. The idea was to illustrate to those present that, while they might have their own desires, in the end, they were not compatible with the government's priorities. One cabinet minister described it as ""confronting reality rather than the referendum slogans"". Then, voila, they were presented again with the prime minister's ""evolved Mansion House"" model, the only answer on offer on Friday aside from stalking out.  One of those present said there was an ""overwhelming sense"" in the room that ""we just had to decide"". The middle ground in the cabinet - those who aren't on either ardent wing - were, it's said, tangibly determined to push for a decision with the prime minister more or less giving the impression to ministers that the only way to avoid taking part in that decision was to quit.  With the day designed as it was, only one seemingly workable plan was presented, so despite deep political division it was inevitably agreed. One cabinet minister joked: ""Put people in a room until they are so hot they will agree to anything."" But Friday's scorching temperatures were coincidental. The way the plan was made by Number 10 and their officials absolutely was not. Every member of the cabinet had their say. Not surprisingly, Brexteers Boris Johnson, Andrea Leadsom, David Davis and Esther McVey are said to have ""moaned a bit"", by one of their colleagues. Home Secretary Sajid Javid asked for assurances from the prime minister that there'd be no sliding on the promise to end unlimited EU immigration. But sources say Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson did not indulge in a fit of political pique, but actually ""engaged on the substance"", in what another described as a bit of a ""symbolic pushback"". Despite all the turbulence of recent months there was no huge face off. All that Brexiteer bravado failed to emerge. One crucial reason, those present say, is because early in the afternoon Michael Gove, one of their number, said overtly that he'd back the PM's plan. One minister said: 'He pulled the rug from under Boris and DD's feet."" Another said: ""He was the decisive voice.""If one of the main voices from the Vote Leave campaign said the deal was a runner, immediately it became harder for the others to resist. Had the Brexiteers been willing, or able, to put up common resistance, the day could have ended very differently.  But as one Brexit source described it, the way the Chequers summit moved: ""The anger had no home."" Michael Gove, who of course is resented by many for knifing Boris Johnson, just gave Eurosceptics another reason to suspect him. There are difficult questions now for the Brexiteers. Be in no doubt, Theresa May's plan is a far closer relationship with the EU than they desired. They are not happy but they are also not united. As a group they are still powerful, they still have the numbers to make life nigh impossible for the prime minister. Even though their representatives at the cabinet table on Friday didn't bite, they have not disappeared. There is discussion among them about what to do next. Some will start the rattling, leadership chatter is likely to surface around the margins. Some may plot to vote against the government soon simply to make a point. Others will argue to let the prime minister have her way, for now.  On Friday the cabinet made a big decision. Theresa May's foes may not have Chequers as a base to hatch their plan, but in the coming days, they are likely to decide. "

Here are the key points from the three page deal published by the government.The UK will ""maintain a common rulebook for all goods"" with the EU, including agricultural products, after Brexit.A treaty will be signed committing the UK to ""continued harmonisation"" with EU rules - avoiding friction at the UK-EU border, including Northern Ireland.Parliament will oversee the UK's trade policy and have the ability to ""choose"" to diverge from the EU rules, ""recognising that this would have consequences"".""Co-operative arrangements"" will be established between EU and UK competition regulators.""Different arrangements"" will be organised for services ""where it is in our interests to have regulatory flexibility"".A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements.This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".The borders between the UK and EU will be treated as a ""combined customs territory"".The UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge  EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU.A post-Brexit UK would be able to ""control its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world"" without causing border disruption. This avoids a hard Irish border, and removes the need for ""backstop"" arrangements to be put in place before the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the government says.The agreement says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"".A ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work.These proposals represent ""a precise and responsible approach to the final stage of the negotiations"", the government says.According to the government the plan:The early reaction from Brexiteers has been that they need to see the full 100-plus page plan  to see whether or not they agree with the government's claims.Full details will be released in a white paper next week.This is not a final Brexit deal. This is an agreement on the UK's preferred way forward as negotiations with the European Union about the future relationship reach a crucial stage. "

The plan was agreed by the prime minister's senior ministers at a 12-hour cabinet awayday on Friday.Mrs May said the plan ""will be good for the UK and good for the EU"".But there has been unhappiness among Tory Brexiteers, with Jacob Rees-Mogg telling the BBC that when the detail emerged, it could yet be worse than leaving the EU without a deal.Mr Rees-Mogg, leader of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said that so far only the three page summary of the deal had been published, and he would have to wait and see the full 100-plus page document to see whether it was in line with the Conservative election manifesto, or amounted to a ""punishment Brexit"".Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""not convinced"" by the deal, and criticised ""leaving out services from trade arrangements in the future... I've got a feeling the whole thing might start to unravel in the next few days"".All Conservative backbench MPs were invited to a briefing with the party's chief whip Julian Smith in Downing Street on Saturday, with about 40 thought to have attended. The message from those leaving the briefing, such as Tory MP Nigel Evans, was that the proposal was for a ""pragmatic"" Brexit delivering on the big referendum issues of sovereignty, immigration and the national finances without harming the ability to trade quickly and freely with the EU.Mr Evans said Mrs May would make a statement to Parliament about the plan on Monday and also address a meeting of all Conservative backbench MPs.The plan that ministers signed up to on Friday aims to create a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods with the bloc, based on a ""common rule book"".It also supports what could amount to a ""combined customs territory"" for the UK and EU.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the prime minister had ""picked a side"" by opting for a closer relationship with the EU than many colleagues desired - and she now had to sell it to her party and the other European leaders.No 10, she added, hoped the new commitments would unlock the next phase of talks with the rest of the EU but it was not yet clear how many, or what kind, of objections had been raised within the cabinet. Downing Street said the proposals marked a ""substantial evolution"" in the UK's position and would resolve outstanding concerns about the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.""This is a proposal that I believe will be good for the UK and good for the EU, and I look forward to it being received positively,"" Mrs May told the BBC. One pro-Brexit cabinet minister told the BBC there was ""no point"" pushing for a vote as ""we were well and truly outnumbered by 20 to seven"".The UK said it now wanted to accelerate the negotiations in an effort to secure an agreement by October, but also warned it will step up preparations for leaving on 29 March 2019 without a deal. EU negotiator Michel Barnier, who earlier suggested the EU would be willing to shift its position if the UK relaxed some of its ""red lines"", tweeted to say the plans would be assessed to see if they were ""workable and realistic"".#Chequers discussion on future to be welcomed. I look forward to White Paper. We will assess proposals to see if they are workable & realistic in view of #EUCO guidelines. Next negotiations w/ #UK on WP, & Withdrawal Agreement, w/c 16 July #BrexitEnd of Twitter post  by @MichelBarnierThe prime minister had gathered her 26 cabinet ministers together at her country residence to try to resolve differences over the shape of the UK's relations with the EU and break the current deadlock with the EU. The main details of the Chequers statement are as follows:Mrs May said this was an ""important step"" in the process of negotiating the UK's smooth exit from the EU.""Of course we still have work to do with the EU in ensuring that we get to that end point in October. But this is good we have come today, following our detailed discussions, to a positive future for the UK,"" she said.She said the proposals, to be formally published in a white paper next week, would give the UK the freedom to strike trade deals with other countries while maintaining regulatory, environmental and consumer standards.In a letter sent to all Conservative MPs, she said she had allowed colleagues to express their views while policy was developed but ""agreement on this proposal marks the point where this is no longer the case and collective responsibility is fully restored"". There is no mention in the document of either the single market or the customs union, which the UK has committed to leave after the end of a transition period in December 2020.Under plans for a free trade zone, the UK would be committed legally to following EU law for a large part of the economy, including manufacturing and farming. While Parliament would retain the right to diverge from EU regulations in these areas, the document makes clear that ""choosing not to pass the relevant legislation would have consequences for market access, security co-operation or the frictionless border"".The document also commits the government to step up preparedness for a no-deal scenario, as one of a range of possible outcomes, ""given the short period remaining before the necessary conclusion of negotiations"".The CBI employers group welcomed the proposals for a free trade area in goods which it said would provide a ""confidence boost"" to business. The Federation of Small Businesses said it was ""encouraging"" to see an agreed negotiating position from government. But FSB chairman Mike Cherry warned: ""The reaction from the rest of the EU is crucial for there to be concrete progress when negotiations restart in just over a week's time. The clock is ticking.""Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said there was ""a danger that this is a lowest common denominator plan"" designed to hold the cabinet together, rather than ""secure the strong negotiating position that we need with the EU"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Once upon a time we were told 'Brexit means Brexit', now we are told it means maintaining a common rulebook for all goods, a joint institutional framework for interpreting the agreement and the UK and EU forming this combined customs territory.""That looks very much like regulatory alignment, the ECJ (European Court of Justice) and half a customs union to me."" Scotland first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the agreement was ""hopefully a step forward"". But the SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, called the agreement ""a fudge"", adding: ""There might be agreement, for now, in the cabinet. The EU will not buy this.""Nigel Dodds, for the Democratic Unionist Party, said:  ""The government's commitment at Chequers to the political and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom with no borders between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom is a welcome reaffirmation of what is an absolute priority for us.""Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said it could be the case that ""Brexiteers have signed up to it knowing perfectly well that it is not going to pass the European Union and they'll then be able to blame Europe for the fact that it won't work"". Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards said: ""This latest proposal continues to cherry pick certain aspects of EU membership in a way that the EU's negotiators have made perfectly clear is unacceptable. More fudge means yet more uncertainty and yet more damage to our economy.""Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who backed Brexit in the referendum, said the deal would end free movement of people and would end the remit of the European Court of Justice in the UK - saying that UK judges always pay regards to other countries' courts, such as Canada or Hong Kong.He added, on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, that the cabinet had agreed to step up preparations for the UK leaving the EU without a Brexit deal.Fellow cabinet Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom also tweeted her backing for the deal.As a passionate Brexiteer with huge optimism about future as a free trading nation, I agree with the PM that keeping the UK together is vital. Alignment on goods, with Parliament sovereign on each decision, free to trade, no more vast payments, ending free movement - good for UK https://t.co/9ZKQkxSaXcEnd of Twitter post  by @andrealeadsomPro-Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave said it would represent a ""bad deal for the UK"" which would ""only slide further as the EU takes more and more"".Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan amounted to a ""sell-out to global corporates"" and would do nothing for the 90% of British firms which do not export to Europe. Veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP Sir Bill Cash said he was ""deeply disappointed to say the least"" about the plans, which he suggested could contradict the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act passed by MPs last month.

In the afternoon, he will meet the Queen in Windsor and then fly to Scotland, where the couple plan to spend the weekend.Thousands are expected to protest in London on Thursday and Friday and marches are also planned for Scotland, where Mr Trump owns golf courses.The Treasury has confirmed it will fund policing costs of up to £5m in Scotland. With officers sent in to help, local policing was being reduced to a ""reactive service"", Mr Kempton said, with additional strain due to the World Cup and the Novichok poisonings in Amesbury.""You have to ask what would happen if were unable to resource incidents like these,"" Mr Kempton added.""Would we see the situation where the military were drafted in place of police officers? Green uniforms instead of the blue ones people would - and should - expect to see?

The EU's chief negotiator said ""realistic and workable"" UK proposals are needed, as the cabinet meets at Chequers, for what happens post-Brexit. Theresa May is expected to propose keeping the UK aligned with the EU on trading rules for goods, not services.If the cabinet agree, proposals will then go to the EU.But Mr Barnier warned in a speech:  ""The single market is our main economic public good. There will be no damaging it, no unravelling what we have achieved together with the UK.""He also repeated warnings that time is running out to reach a deal. ""Time is short. We need to quickly have realistic and workable solutions and obviously we look forward to the UK's White Paper.""The UK's proposals will facilitate both the UK's internal political debate and negotiation with us.""Our objective has always been to find an agreement with the UK, not against the UK.""Talks with the EU continue over the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU in March next year. What happens to the Irish border remains a sticking point.Both sides want a deal to be reached by the next European Council meeting in October.Mr Barnier also said there was a need to ""de-dramatise"" the issue of the ""backstop"" - the EU's proposal to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, if the EU and UK cannot agree new arrangements in time.Under the EU's proposals ""a limited set of EU rules would continue to apply in Northern Ireland as they do today"", Mr Barnier said in a speech."

The code states that ""anti-Semitism is racism. It is unacceptable in our party and in wider society"".But some critics think it does not sign up in full to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition of anti-Semitism.Labour insists it does meet the full IHRA definition, which it says was adopted by the party in December 2016.Labour MPs Chuka Umunna, Liz Kendall and Anna Turley are among those who have been critical.Mr Umunna tweeted he was ""utterly appalled"":Our values dictate that we treat all groups the same and yet, again and again, we see examples of the Jewish community being treated differently to other groups by the Labour Party. This is discrimination, pure and simple, and it is totally unacceptable.End of Twitter post  by @ChukaUmunnaWhile Ms Turley tweeted: I am sincerely sorry to Jewish people in this country. Labour are getting this all terribly wrong. Not in my name. https://t.co/wQZUVSd4naEnd of Twitter post  by @annaturleyThe Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews said in a joint statement that it was ""impossible to understand"" why Labour had not adopted the IHRA definition in full - as the UK Jewish community, governments and local councils had done.Labour's code, which was approved by a sub-committee of its National Executive Committee, came about after the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry into anti-Semitism. It does endorse the IHRA's working definition of anti-Semitism and includes behaviours it lists as likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics think it leaves out four examples: However, Labour insisted the examples which are not in the bulleted section are addressed in the guidelines.In their joint statement, Jonathan Goldstein of the Jewish Leadership Council and Marie van der Zyl of the Board of Deputies said it was ""for Jews to determine themselves what anti-Semitism is"".The Labour Against Anti-Semitism campaign described it as a ""toothless document"" adding: ""The Labour Party already has very little credibility left as the anti-racist body it has always claimed to be. ""The formal adoption of this document would see any remaining credibility lost, perhaps permanently.""A Labour source said Labour Against Anti-Semitism's claims were ""ludicrous and entirely false"".And a spokesman for the Labour Party said: ""These are the most detailed and comprehensive guidelines on anti-Semitism adopted by any political party in this country.""They draw on the IHRA examples and other sources to provide practical examples of anti-Semitism which can be applied to complaints cases and used in political education programmes to foster deeper understanding of anti-Semitism among members.""Mr Umunna and Ms Turley are not the only Labour MPs to criticise the code. Bassetlaw MP John Mann tweeted:The Macpherson definition of racism has been accepted until now by every mainstream political party in Parliament. The Labour NEC are the first to refuse to accept it, which has huge consequences. https://t.co/U3IZVcCXOkEnd of Twitter post  by @JohnMannMPWhile Leicester West MP Liz Kendall said on Twitter:IHRA definition of anti semitism is used by U.K, Scottish & Welsh Govts, 124 local councils & Crown Prosecution Service.

2018-07-07,Airbus: Ministers have 'no clue' on Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180708020034/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44735505,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe chief executive of planemaker Airbus has accused the government of having no idea how to take the UK out of the EU without damaging the country.Tom Enders said it ""still has no clue, or at least no consensus, on how to execute Brexit without severe harm"".He was speaking as ministers prepare to meet at the prime minister's country residence to agree a blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU.Airbus is taking steps to mitigate the impact of Brexit, Mr Enders said.""Brexit in any form, soft or hard, light or clean - whatever you call it - will be damaging,"" he added.A government spokesperson said it was confident of reaching a good Brexit deal, adding: ""We do not expect a no-deal scenario to arise.""Mr Enders' comments follow a warning given last month that Airbus could leave the UK if the country leaves the single market and customs union without a transition deal.At the time, the company said: ""This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country.""Airbus makes wings for the A320, A330/A340, A350 and A380 passenger planes in the UK and has 14,000 staff.By Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondentTom Enders made his comments in a light-hearted fashion - with a reference to England and France potentially facing each other in the World Cup final thrown in. But the message was deadly serious. The gloves have come off.It seems Airbus has lost patience with what it perceives as government infighting, and is demanding at least a degree of clarity over what the future will bring. In June, the European aerospace giant warned that a hard Brexit could force it to reconsider its investments in the UK. That produced a slap-down from the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who said its ""threats"" were ""completely inappropriate"".In response, Mr Enders pointed out today that if there was one company that made its voice heard, not only in London but in European capitals as well, it was Airbus. No plans to stay quiet then - and so a forthright message was delivered just as ministers gathered ahead of that oh-so-important meeting at Chequers.Airbus said the current planned transition period, due to end in December 2020, was too short for it to make changes to its supply chain.Mr Enders said he had a duty to Airbus shareholders to speak up: ""We have been very clear about what the consequences particularly of a hard Brexit would be."" His comments are the latest warning on Brexit by big business. On Thursday, Jaguar Land Rover - the UK's biggest carmaker - said a ""bad"" Brexit deal could force it to close factories and would threaten £80bn of investment plans for the UK."

Mark Carney said recent data had given him ""greater confidence"" that weak first-quarter growth ""was largely due to the weather"". He said household spending and sentiment had ""bounced back strongly"".England winning the World Cup would be an ""unalloyed, unadulterated absolute good"" for the economy, Mr Carney added.In a speech at the Northern Powerhouse Summit in Newcastle, Mr Carney said: ""Overall, recent domestic data suggest the economy is evolving largely in line with the May Inflation Report projections, which see demand growing at rates slightly above those of supply and domestic cost pressures building.""The pound edged up 0.2% against the dollar to $1.3254 following his remarks.Last month, three members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee - including chief economist Andy Haldane - voted in favour of lifting the interest rate to 0.75%. Mr Carney was among the six MPC members who voted to keep rates on hold at 0.5%.  He also warned that a global trade war could dampen economic growth.Mr Carney said ""protectionist rhetoric"" was rising and was now turning into action: ""There are some, tentative signs that this more hostile and uncertain trading environment may be dampening activity.""He cited evidence from the IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI), which suggested that global export orders and manufacturing output have fallen back from highs at the start of the year.On Friday, the US will implement a 25% import tariff on a list of hundreds of Chinese goods. On the same day, China will also impose 25% tariffs on a range of US goods, including pork products, fish and rice. In a Q&A session after his speech, Mr Carney - who was wearing a Three Lions lapel badge - was asked about the economic impact of an England win.""It would be an unalloyed, unadulterated absolute good. Everything would be good,"" he replied.The Bank governor also praised the England team's work ethic, humility and its innovation, adding: ""This is a pleasure to watch right now, so we are all behind them.""When the event host said ""In Gareth we trust"", Mr Carney quipped: ""I will get my waistcoat this afternoon."""

During this period the UK will continue to abide by European Court rulings.David Lidington, the Minister for the Cabinet Office, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) jurisdiction ""extinguishes"" on 29 March 2019 - at the end of the Article 50 process.Is he right?The UK is expected to leave the European Union next March and then enter a transition period.This period is meant to last until the end of December 2020. The government calls it an implementation period and says it will allow for the ""orderly withdrawal"" of the UK from the EU.During the transition, the UK's relationship with the EU will be similar to what it is now. For example, it will continue to belong to the single market and the customs union. The UK will also continue to be under the full jurisdiction of the ECJ.The draft withdrawal agreement, published by the European Commission in March, sets out the terms of the transition. It said: ""The Court of Justice of the European Union shall continue to have jurisdiction for any proceedings brought before it by the United Kingdom or against the United Kingdom before the end of the transition period.""In January David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, was asked directly in Parliament if the UK would be under the jurisdiction of the European court during the transition.He replied: ""Yes, in that period.""Of course this is all predicated on the government securing a deal on its future relationship with the EU. As Theresa May and others have previously said: ""Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.""So if the government failed to agree post-transition terms with the EU and the UK ended up with a ""no deal"" Brexit, then the UK could leave ECJ jurisdiction in March 2019.But that is not the government's current policy. The Cabinet Office told us Mr Lidington's comments would only apply in a no deal scenario.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

Here is a guide to the ""who, why, and when"".Why is there a contest? Carwyn Jones shocked the Welsh Labour conference in April when he announced he would step down as their leader and first minister at the end of the year.  He said he had been through ""the darkest of times"" - a reference to the death last November of Carl Sargeant, four days after Mr Jones sacked him as communities secretary. Who is in the running?Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford was first to declare, with backing from more than the minimum five AMs needed for the nomination.   Vaughan Gething, Eluned Morgan and Huw Irranca-Davies have also said they want to stand but unless the rules change on nominations not all of them will get onto the ballot paper.When will the winner be named?Welsh Labour will hold a special conference in September to decide the rules of the contest, amid debate over whether it should be one member one vote (OMOV) or an electoral college which gives more weight to the views of MPs, AMs and organisations such as trade unions.   The result is expected around early December, nine years to the month that Carwyn Jones took over from Rhodri Morgan.Why is there a contest?Neil Hamilton was ousted as leader of the five-strong UKIP group in May by Caroline Jones, who promised a more collaborative approach to Senedd politics.  The former Tory MP vowed to regain the group leadership, prompting UKIP HQ in London to step in and order a ballot of UKIP members in Wales to settle the row.Who is in the running?Neil Hamilton and Caroline Jones have both declared their intention to stand, along with Gareth Bennett, who has vowed to campaign to abolish the assembly.When will the winner be named?UKIP has said it expects to announce the result of the membership ballot by the end of July.Why is there a contest?Andrew RT Davies quit the leadership last Wednesday feeling he had lost the support of his colleagues.  He had been condemned within the party the previous Friday for accusing firms such as Airbus of undermining Brexit by voicing their concerns about the impact on trade.    But the ardent supporter of Brexit later told BBC Wales he had been aware of moves to unseat him for some time. Who is in the running?Interim leader Paul Davies has said he would like the job on a permanent basis, and Suzy Davies has also put her name forward.  While both backed Remain in the 2016 referendum on Europe, former Welsh Secretary David Jones has said the next assembly group leader should reflect what he called the ""overwhelmingly Eurosceptic"" views of grassroots members in Wales.When will the winner be named?A postal ballot of Welsh Conservative members will take place in August, and the result declared on 6 September. Why is there a contest?Plaid rules allow for a leadership contest every two years, and the window for a challenge closed on Wednesday.  Despite Leanne Wood's high profile in TV election debates in recent years, there has been unhappiness within party ranks at the apparent lack of progress in terms of AMs and MPs elected.   In June Ms Wood said she would welcome a contest and felt ""very"" confident of winning it.Who is in the running?Earlier in June Rhun ap Iorwerth said he had ""no plans"" to challenge Ms Wood, but has announced a bid saying she had invited a debate on Plaid's leadership and supporters had urged him to stand.  On Monday, Adam Price called on Ms Wood to share the leadership with a man to boost Plaid's fortunes or face the prospect of a challenge.  She turned the proposal down and Mr Price has now thrown his hat into the ring too.When will the winner be named?Plaid Cymru says it will announce a timetable shortly.The Welsh Lib Dems had a leadership election last November, when Jane Dodds beat Elizabeth Evans in a vote of the membership.   She took over from Mark Williams, the last remaining Welsh Lib Dem MP who stepped down after losing his Ceredigion seat at the 2017 general election.   With the sole Lib Dem AM Kirsty Williams serving in the Welsh Government as education secretary, the party changed its rules which previously said the Welsh leader had to be an AM or MP.    "

Have the voters they represent been able to decide what kind of Brexit they want?Two years after the UK narrowly voted to leave the European Union, ministers are working towards the withdrawal deadline of 29 March 2019 - despite reports that they are divided over what Brexit should look like.The debate - which has also seen arguments about whether there should be referendum on a final deal - is often presented as a choice between so-called ""hard"" and ""soft"" Brexit. These terms mean different things to different people - but a ""hard"" Brexit is generally taken to mean a significant change, with the UK leaving the EU single market and customs union, and no longer implementing EU freedom of movement rules.""Soft"" Brexit is often used to describe the UK keeping some kind of free trade arrangement with the EU, remaining in a customs union and allowing EU citizens to live and work in the UK. But where do the UK's voters, who remain more or less evenly divided on whether they support leaving the EU, stand on what the future relationship should be like post-Brexit? Please upgrade your browserTwo polling companies, Opinium and ORB International, have been tracking this issue since the referendum. The wording of their questions is important.Opinium asked voters: ""If it becomes apparent that we will not be able to have one without the other, which of the following should be the government's negotiating priority during the Brexit negotiations?  Staying in the single market even if it means allowing free movement of labour, or ending free movement of labour even if it means we leave the single market?""The first option refers to a ""soft"" Brexit, the second to a ""hard"" one.The graph below shows the average percentage choosing each answer at four key points since January 2017.Three things stand out. First, many voters find answering this question difficult - about a quarter continue to say they are not sure which would be the better choice. It may be some are struggling with what is meant by ""the single market"" or ""free movement"", while others would perhaps like to be able to do both.Second, there is no clear majority in favour of either option. Third, there seems to have been a slight - but only slight - tilt in favour of staying in the single market rather than ending free movement. The four-point advantage for staying in the single market contrasts with a five-point lead for ending free movement in a couple of polls that Opinium conducted in early 2017. But this is just one question from one company. And all pollsters know the answer they get often depends on how the question is posed. ORB has taken a different approach.Every month since November 2016, it has asked people to agree or disagree with the following proposition: ""Having greater control over immigration ['hard Brexit'] is more important than having access to free trade with the EU ['soft Brexit']."" The graph shows the average for all the polls conducted in five time periods.Voters evidently find ORB's question easier to answer, though as many as 15% still stay they don't know. Among those who do answer, slightly more say they back a hard Brexit - that is, they agree that controlling immigration is more important than free trade with the EU. There is no consistent evidence that this picture has changed during the past two years.However, ORB's data confirms Opinium's suggestion that the UK is split in its views about the kind of Brexit it would like to see.This is perhaps not surprising given that the country is still more or less evenly divided between Remain and Leave.In its recent polls, Opinium has found that, on average, about two-thirds of Remain voters (68%) prioritise staying in the single market, while three-fifths of Leave supporters (61%) feel it is more important to end free movement. The balance of opinion among Conservative and Labour supporters is rather different too. According to Opinium, 40% of Conservative supporters would prioritise ending free movement and only 20% staying in the single market. But among Labour supporters, the equivalent figures are 11% and 45% respectively. Some of the demographic divisions revealed by the 2016 referendum are repeated in the hard-v-soft debate too. ORB's recent polls suggest only 26% of 18- to 24-year-olds and 35% of 25- to 34-year-olds agree it is more important to control immigration than to secure access to free trade with the EU. In contrast, most of those aged 65 or over (56%) and 55- to 64-year-olds (53%) hold that view.Meanwhile, women (38%) are much more likely than men (16%) to say they are not sure whether the UK should stay in the single market, or end free movement.Another aspect of the hard-v-soft debate on which polling has been relatively scarce is whether or not the UK should stay in a customs union with the EU. But in the past couple of months, Opinium has asked people if they've heard about a customs union, and whether the government should try to stay in the EU customs union in order to prioritise EU trade or to leave it to allow the UK to grow its trade links with the rest of the world. On both occasions, more than a fifth said they had not heard of the customs union at all, while 16-17% said they didn't know what the government's priority should be. So, despite the heated debate the issue has recently generated at Westminster, it appears to have passed many voters by. Among those with a preference, public opinion is again more or less evenly divided, with 31-32% arguing the UK should stay in the customs union and 30% disagreeing. How Sweden is preparing for Russia to hack its electionLocal election results 2018: How important was the Brexit effect?Why politicians often row about taxThe six tribes that could shape Europe's futureSo, however the issue is addressed, two points stand out about public attitudes towards Brexit. First, many voters are not at all sure about what kind of Brexit they would like. Second, among those who do have a view, opinion is more or less evenly divided. This makes it very difficult for any politician to be sure how best to interpret the ""will of the people"" as expressed in the EU referendum. But that is the challenge that they face as the Brexit negotiations now move up a gear.About this pieceThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.John Curtice is professor of politics at Strathclyde University and research fellow at the NatCen Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.He is also chief commentator at WhatUKthinks.org.Edited by Jennifer Clarke"

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-07,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180708020034/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-07-08,Brexit Secretary David Davis resigns,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709015118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44761056,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBrexit Secretary David Davis has resigned from the UK government.His resignation comes days after Theresa May secured the cabinet's backing for her Brexit plan despite claims from critics that it was ""soft"".Mr Davis was appointed to the post in 2016 and was responsible for negotiating the UK's EU withdrawal.Junior minister Steven Baker quit shortly after Mr Davis - as Mrs May prepares to face MPs and peers on Monday.In his resignation letter, Mr Davis told Mrs May ""the current trend of policy and tactics"" was making it ""look less and less likely"" that the UK would leave the customs union and single market.He said he was ""unpersuaded"" that the government's negotiating approach ""will not just lead to further demands for concessions"" from Brussels.Mr Davis said: ""The general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one.""In her reply, Mrs May said: ""I do not agree with your characterisation of the policy we agreed at Cabinet on Friday.""She said she was ""sorry"" he was leaving but would ""like to thank you warmly for everything you have done... to shape our departure from the EU"".Brexiteer Conservative MP Peter Bone hailed the resignation as a ""principled and brave decision"", adding: ""The PM's proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable.""Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May was ""incapable of delivering Brexit"".David Davis resigning at such a crucial time shows @Theresa_May has no authority left and is incapable of delivering Brexit. With her Government in chaos, if she clings on, it's clear she's more interested in hanging on for her own sake than serving the people of our country.End of Twitter post  by @jeremycorbynBy BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergAfter many months of rumours that he would pull the plug, David Davis has actually quit as Brexit Secretary. His unhappiness in government has been no secret for some time, but after the prime minister's Chequers agreement with cabinet ministers to pursue looser ties with the EU than he desired, he found his position untenable. After a visit to Downing Street on Sunday he concluded that he had no choice but to walk. It's expected that at least one other minister will resign alongside him from the Brexit department. The move, while not completely surprising, throws doubt onto how secure the government's Brexit strategy is. Read Laura's full blog here.In the Commons on Monday Mrs May is expected to tell MPs that the strategy agreed on by the cabinet at Chequers on Friday is the ""right Brexit"" for Britain.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understands Mr Davis was ""furious"" after a meeting at Number 10 earlier on Sunday and ""concluded he could not stay in post"".Davis concluded he could not stay in post after a meeting in Number 10 earlier today - understand he was furious at Number 10 handlingEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakShe also said that Environment Secretary Michael Gove is the favourite to take on the vacant post.On Sunday he told the BBC he was urging Tory MPs to support Mrs May and her Brexit plan.Some Remain-supporting politicians said the resignation was evidence of the need for a second referendum.Baron Adonis, a prominent backer of a second vote, tweeted: ""People's Vote to put Brexit out of its misery a big step closer after DD's resignation. Now the Brexiteers holding Mrs May hostage are falling out, there isn't a majority for any withdrawal treaty in Parliament.""The Liberal Democrats called on people to sign a petition for a vote on the proposed deal, adding: ""The resignation of David Davis is yet more evidence of the chaos of this Tory Brexit. You deserve the final say on this shambolic Brexit with the chance to stay in the EU.""Conservative MP William Wragg, who campaigned for Brexit, said Mr Davis's resignation was ""the right thing to do"" while Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, who quit a junior government role earlier this year to ""fight for Brexit"", said it was ""fantastic news"", adding: ""Well done David Davis for having the principle and guts to resign"". SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on Mrs May to ""see sense and bring forward a plan that heeds the mounting evidence against a hard Brexit""."
2018-07-08,'No fresh sanctions for Russia' says Javid,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709015118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44757239,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSajid Javid has said there are ""no current plans"" to impose fresh sanctions on Russia over the latest nerve agent poisonings in Wiltshire.He repeated the government's assessment that Russia was the source of the poison but said he would not ""jump to conclusions"".The home secretary was speaking during a visit to Amesbury, where two people remain critically ill in hospital.Their symptoms were the same as those of Sergei and Yulia Skripal.Mr Skripal, a Russian former spy, and his daughter were poisoned with Novichok in March. It was Mr Javid's first visit as home secretary to Salisbury and Amesbury, where Dawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, fell ill a week ago. Police believe the couple handled an item contaminated with the nerve agent Novichok. ""What our expert scientists have determined is that the nerve agent in this incident is the same exact nerve agent that was used back in March,"" he said. ""We know back in March that was the Russians. We know it was a barbaric, inhuman act by the Russian state."" Russia has denied any involvement. Mr Javid added: ""Again for this particular incident we need to learn more and let the police do their work.""He met local people and business owners during his visit, and also praised emergency services for their response to the poisonings.The home secretary said ""the risk to the public remains low"", adding that he was ""very confident"" police would uncover the source of the poison. He said the area remains ""open for business"" and urged people to show their support and visit. The police's ""working hypothesis"" is that the Amesbury poisoning and the Salisbury incident are linked, but Mr Javid called for the police to be given ""time and space"" to work.""What I am very confident of, with the amount of police work that's going on here - the support both from Wiltshire Police but also more than 100 officers from the counter-terrorism network involved as well - that they will eventually, one way or the other, get to the bottom of this,"" he said.He rejected suggestions that the government had been too quick to insist Salisbury was safe after the attack on the Skripals in March.It is not believed that the couple in the latest poisoning incident had visited the sites connected to the Skripals in Salisbury, he added."

""We recognise that people will still want to have opportunities in each other's countries,"" she said.But a briefing being circulated to the European Research Group (ERG) - a group of Eurosceptic Conservative backbench MPs - says the prime minister's plan ""would lead directly to a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit"".The 18-page document expresses concern the UK would have to follow EU laws and European Court of Justice rulings and would not be able to develop an ""effective international trade policy"".The BBC understands Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was vocal and hostile in his opposition to Mrs May's plan, which he reportedly said would leave the UK as a ""vassal state"" and be a ""serious inhibitor of free trade"".Allies of Mr Johnson say he is staying in the cabinet to ""make the argument for Brexiteers"".Asked if it was possible EU citizens might get some preferential treatment, the prime minister said: ""We are going to decide. What we're going to do is say what works for the UK, what's right for the United Kingdom?""A day after she secured cabinet approval on a plan for Britain's future relationship with the EU, Mrs May said ministers were now expected to speak with collective responsibility.  ""Collective responsibility has returned... we are moving forward together,"" she told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg.Tory Brexiteer and ERG chair Jacob Rees-Mogg previously told the BBC that when detail of the plan emerged, it could yet be worse than leaving the EU without a deal.Mr Rees-Mogg, said that so far only the three page summary of the deal had been published, and he would have to wait to see the full 100-plus page document to decide whether it was in line with the Conservative election manifesto, or amounted to a ""punishment Brexit"".Mrs May will now have to take the plan to the EU, which she said was now ready to sit down and discuss the proposals. ""From the soundings I've had so far, there is a willingness to sit down and talk about this and a recognition that actually we now are in the stage where we need to agree what the future relationship's going to be,"" Mrs May said on Saturday.""This is a serious, workable proposal,"" she added.The plans that ministers backed would see an end to freedom of movement. But a ""mobility framework"" would be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply to study and work.Mrs May said when people voted to leave the EU, ""they wanted to take control of our money, our laws and our borders and that's exactly what we will do"".The main details from the Chequers statement:"

In the Commons on Monday, Theresa May will tell MPs her plan will mean ""a complete end to freedom of movement"", restore the ""supremacy of the British courts"" and ensure no more ""vast sums of money"" would be sent to Brussels.She is expected to say that since the 2016 referendum decision to leave the EU, ""I have listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit. This is the right Brexit"".Several Tory MPs have expressed unease since Friday, when the cabinet approved a document setting out the UK's vision for its future relationship with the EU after it leaves in March 2019. Under the proposals, yet to be presented to the EU, there would be a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods, based on a ""common rule book"" and a ""combined customs territory"".Boris Johnson is understood to have strongly criticised the plan during the cabinet meeting at Chequers before signing up to it. He is said to have warned colleagues it could be a ""serious inhibitor to free trade"" and striking deals with other countries.The foreign secretary then backed the proposals - despite claiming that defending the plans was like ""polishing a turd"".But environment secretary Mr Gove, who campaigned for Brexit alongside Mr Johnson in the 2016 referendum, told the BBC's Andrew Marr show he was satisfied the solution would ""honour"" the result of the vote.The free movement of people was ending, he said, and the UK Parliament would have the final say over rules governing a ""huge swathe"" of the British economy.""In all the important areas where an independent country chooses to exercise sovereignty, the UK will be able to do so and, in so doing, respect the referendum result and the mandate we were given,"" he said.Asked if Mrs May's offer was all he had hoped for, he replied: ""No, but then I'm a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn't, you shouldn't, make the perfect the enemy of the good.""While urging his colleagues to get behind the prime minister as she tries to secure a deal by October, he said the UK must be prepared for this not happening.""We are being generous to the EU, we are showing flexibility,"" he said. ""If the EU is not generous and flexible, we may have to contemplate walking away without a deal.""No-one wants to walk away now because we are in the middle of a negotiation - what we need to be able to do is to walk away in March 2019.""After ministers signed up to the deal on Friday night, Mrs May said the time for them to air their concerns in public was over and collective cabinet responsibility had been re-instated - a stance endorsed by Mr Gove.The prime minister has urged the EU to take her offer seriously. She refused to rule out offering EU citizens some form of special status as part of a proposed new ""mobility framework"". But Tory Brexiteers not in the government have spoken out against the plan, warning the UK will have to follow EU laws and European Court of Justice rulings and not have an ""effective international trade policy"".Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said the proposed deal was ""indefensible"" as it was ""probably worse than staying in the EU"". He suggested his support for the prime minister was not unconditional. ""At the moment, she's not only let the party down, she's let herself down,"" he told the BBC. ""If she sticks with this deal, I have no confidence in it. If she sticks with this, I will have no confidence in her.""And pro-Remain Tory MP Phillip Lee has suggested the offer was the ""worst of all worlds"" and restated his call for a second referendum - with the option of staying in the EU to be on the ballot paper. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said proposals to avoid customs checks by differentiating between UK and EU-bound goods, in terms of what tariffs should be paid, were ""a bureaucratic nightmare"". ""This has got fudge written all over it,"" he told Andrew Marr. ""She (Theresa May) has not met our demands. It is going to unravel and she will have to think again.""He urged Mrs May to put her customs proposals to a vote in Parliament in a week's time, suggesting Labour's alternative plan for a comprehensive customs union had the backing of the majority of MPs.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""game on"" for the SNP and others who wanted the UK to remain in the existing customs union and single market. On the other side of the debate, UKIP leader Gerard Batten said Mrs May was ""surrendering"" to the EU and ""dashing the hopes and dreams of 17.4 million British voters"" who backed Brexit in 2016.

2018-07-08,Tory tensions on Europe still profound,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709015118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44751167,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowYou can't resolve 40 years of differences with an extra 40 minutes. The cabinet meeting on Friday to get the grumpy group on board with Theresa May's plan for Brexit ran a little longer than her team had hoped, by 40 minutes. But now they are cock-a-hoop over what they achieved. Tensions in the Tory Party over Europe are still profound. But the Brexiteers were subdued with some neat Whitehall manoeuvring, and strong political arguments in preparation. Ministers this week received one paper explaining why a Canada-style trade deal couldn't work because it wouldn't prevent an Irish hard border. Another then about why the Norway model, the European Economic Area, couldn't work. A third paper too explaining how leaving with no deal might cause such an economic upset, that the Tories would be punished for a generation. Then finally late on Thursday before the meeting - ta dah! - a paper proposing the magic solution, well at least the prime minister's compromise. That layering of arguments was repeated in real life by the sessions on Friday at Chequers. Experts (they're back apparently) from government explained the problems with the models, and answered questions from the floor. The idea was to illustrate to those present that, while they might have their own desires, in the end, they were not compatible with the government's priorities. One cabinet minister described it as ""confronting reality rather than the referendum slogans"". Then, voila, they were presented again with the prime minister's ""evolved Mansion House"" model, the only answer on offer on Friday aside from stalking out.  One of those present said there was an ""overwhelming sense"" in the room that ""we just had to decide"". The middle ground in the cabinet - those who aren't on either ardent wing - were, it's said, tangibly determined to push for a decision with the prime minister more or less giving the impression to ministers that the only way to avoid taking part in that decision was to quit.  With the day designed as it was, only one seemingly workable plan was presented, so despite deep political division it was inevitably agreed. One cabinet minister joked: ""Put people in a room until they are so hot they will agree to anything."" But Friday's scorching temperatures were coincidental. The way the plan was made by Number 10 and their officials absolutely was not. Every member of the cabinet had their say. Not surprisingly, Brexteers Boris Johnson, Andrea Leadsom, David Davis and Esther McVey are said to have ""moaned a bit"", by one of their colleagues. Home Secretary Sajid Javid asked for assurances from the prime minister that there'd be no sliding on the promise to end unlimited EU immigration. But sources say Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson did not indulge in a fit of political pique, but actually ""engaged on the substance"", in what another described as a bit of a ""symbolic pushback"". Despite all the turbulence of recent months there was no huge face off. All that Brexiteer bravado failed to emerge. One crucial reason, those present say, is because early in the afternoon Michael Gove, one of their number, said overtly that he'd back the PM's plan. One minister said: 'He pulled the rug from under Boris and DD's feet."" Another said: ""He was the decisive voice.""If one of the main voices from the Vote Leave campaign said the deal was a runner, immediately it became harder for the others to resist. Had the Brexiteers been willing, or able, to put up common resistance, the day could have ended very differently.  But as one Brexit source described it, the way the Chequers summit moved: ""The anger had no home."" Michael Gove, who of course is resented by many for knifing Boris Johnson, just gave Eurosceptics another reason to suspect him. There are difficult questions now for the Brexiteers. Be in no doubt, Theresa May's plan is a far closer relationship with the EU than they desired. They are not happy but they are also not united. As a group they are still powerful, they still have the numbers to make life nigh impossible for the prime minister. Even though their representatives at the cabinet table on Friday didn't bite, they have not disappeared. There is discussion among them about what to do next. Some will start the rattling, leadership chatter is likely to surface around the margins. Some may plot to vote against the government soon simply to make a point. Others will argue to let the prime minister have her way, for now.  On Friday the cabinet made a big decision. Theresa May's foes may not have Chequers as a base to hatch their plan, but in the coming days, they are likely to decide. "

This avoids a hard Irish border, and removes the need for ""backstop"" arrangements to be put in place before the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the government says.The agreement says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"".A ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work.These proposals represent ""a precise and responsible approach to the final stage of the negotiations"", the government says.According to the government the plan:The early reaction from Brexiteers has been that they need to see the full 100-plus page plan  to see whether or not they agree with the government's claims.Full details will be released in a white paper next week.This is not a final Brexit deal.

The plan was agreed by the prime minister's senior ministers at a 12-hour cabinet awayday on Friday.Mrs May said the plan ""will be good for the UK and good for the EU"".But there has been unhappiness among Tory Brexiteers, with Jacob Rees-Mogg telling the BBC that when the detail emerged, it could yet be worse than leaving the EU without a deal.Mr Rees-Mogg, leader of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said that so far only the three page summary of the deal had been published, and he would have to wait and see the full 100-plus page document to see whether it was in line with the Conservative election manifesto, or amounted to a ""punishment Brexit"".Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was ""not convinced"" by the deal, and criticised ""leaving out services from trade arrangements in the future... I've got a feeling the whole thing might start to unravel in the next few days"".All Conservative backbench MPs were invited to a briefing with the party's chief whip Julian Smith in Downing Street on Saturday, with about 40 thought to have attended. The message from those leaving the briefing, such as Tory MP Nigel Evans, was that the proposal was for a ""pragmatic"" Brexit delivering on the big referendum issues of sovereignty, immigration and the national finances without harming the ability to trade quickly and freely with the EU.Mr Evans said Mrs May would make a statement to Parliament about the plan on Monday and also address a meeting of all Conservative backbench MPs.The plan that ministers signed up to on Friday aims to create a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods with the bloc, based on a ""common rule book"".It also supports what could amount to a ""combined customs territory"" for the UK and EU.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the prime minister had ""picked a side"" by opting for a closer relationship with the EU than many colleagues desired - and she now had to sell it to her party and the other European leaders.No 10, she added, hoped the new commitments would unlock the next phase of talks with the rest of the EU but it was not yet clear how many, or what kind, of objections had been raised within the cabinet. Downing Street said the proposals marked a ""substantial evolution"" in the UK's position and would resolve outstanding concerns about the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.""This is a proposal that I believe will be good for the UK and good for the EU, and I look forward to it being received positively,"" Mrs May told the BBC. One pro-Brexit cabinet minister told the BBC there was ""no point"" pushing for a vote as ""we were well and truly outnumbered by 20 to seven"".The UK said it now wanted to accelerate the negotiations in an effort to secure an agreement by October, but also warned it will step up preparations for leaving on 29 March 2019 without a deal. EU negotiator Michel Barnier, who earlier suggested the EU would be willing to shift its position if the UK relaxed some of its ""red lines"", tweeted to say the plans would be assessed to see if they were ""workable and realistic"".#Chequers discussion on future to be welcomed.

Next negotiations w/ #UK on WP, & Withdrawal Agreement, w/c 16 July #BrexitEnd of Twitter post  by @MichelBarnierThe prime minister had gathered her 26 cabinet ministers together at her country residence to try to resolve differences over the shape of the UK's relations with the EU and break the current deadlock with the EU. The main details of the Chequers statement are as follows:Mrs May said this was an ""important step"" in the process of negotiating the UK's smooth exit from the EU.""Of course we still have work to do with the EU in ensuring that we get to that end point in October. But this is good we have come today, following our detailed discussions, to a positive future for the UK,"" she said.She said the proposals, to be formally published in a white paper next week, would give the UK the freedom to strike trade deals with other countries while maintaining regulatory, environmental and consumer standards.In a letter sent to all Conservative MPs, she said she had allowed colleagues to express their views while policy was developed but ""agreement on this proposal marks the point where this is no longer the case and collective responsibility is fully restored"". There is no mention in the document of either the single market or the customs union, which the UK has committed to leave after the end of a transition period in December 2020.Under plans for a free trade zone, the UK would be committed legally to following EU law for a large part of the economy, including manufacturing and farming. While Parliament would retain the right to diverge from EU regulations in these areas, the document makes clear that ""choosing not to pass the relevant legislation would have consequences for market access, security co-operation or the frictionless border"".The document also commits the government to step up preparedness for a no-deal scenario, as one of a range of possible outcomes, ""given the short period remaining before the necessary conclusion of negotiations"".The CBI employers group welcomed the proposals for a free trade area in goods which it said would provide a ""confidence boost"" to business. The Federation of Small Businesses said it was ""encouraging"" to see an agreed negotiating position from government. But FSB chairman Mike Cherry warned: ""The reaction from the rest of the EU is crucial for there to be concrete progress when negotiations restart in just over a week's time. The clock is ticking.""Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said there was ""a danger that this is a lowest common denominator plan"" designed to hold the cabinet together, rather than ""secure the strong negotiating position that we need with the EU"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Once upon a time we were told 'Brexit means Brexit', now we are told it means maintaining a common rulebook for all goods, a joint institutional framework for interpreting the agreement and the UK and EU forming this combined customs territory.""That looks very much like regulatory alignment, the ECJ (European Court of Justice) and half a customs union to me."" Scotland first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the agreement was ""hopefully a step forward"". But the SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, called the agreement ""a fudge"", adding: ""There might be agreement, for now, in the cabinet. The EU will not buy this.""Nigel Dodds, for the Democratic Unionist Party, said:  ""The government's commitment at Chequers to the political and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom with no borders between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom is a welcome reaffirmation of what is an absolute priority for us.""Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said it could be the case that ""Brexiteers have signed up to it knowing perfectly well that it is not going to pass the European Union and they'll then be able to blame Europe for the fact that it won't work"". Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards said: ""This latest proposal continues to cherry pick certain aspects of EU membership in a way that the EU's negotiators have made perfectly clear is unacceptable. More fudge means yet more uncertainty and yet more damage to our economy.""Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who backed Brexit in the referendum, said the deal would end free movement of people and would end the remit of the European Court of Justice in the UK - saying that UK judges always pay regards to other countries' courts, such as Canada or Hong Kong.He added, on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, that the cabinet had agreed to step up preparations for the UK leaving the EU without a Brexit deal.Fellow cabinet Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom also tweeted her backing for the deal.As a passionate Brexiteer with huge optimism about future as a free trading nation, I agree with the PM that keeping the UK together is vital.

The EU's chief negotiator said ""realistic and workable"" UK proposals are needed, as the cabinet meets at Chequers, for what happens post-Brexit. Theresa May is expected to propose keeping the UK aligned with the EU on trading rules for goods, not services.If the cabinet agree, proposals will then go to the EU.But Mr Barnier warned in a speech:  ""The single market is our main economic public good. There will be no damaging it, no unravelling what we have achieved together with the UK.""He also repeated warnings that time is running out to reach a deal. ""Time is short. We need to quickly have realistic and workable solutions and obviously we look forward to the UK's White Paper.""The UK's proposals will facilitate both the UK's internal political debate and negotiation with us.""Our objective has always been to find an agreement with the UK, not against the UK.""Talks with the EU continue over the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU in March next year. What happens to the Irish border remains a sticking point.Both sides want a deal to be reached by the next European Council meeting in October.Mr Barnier also said there was a need to ""de-dramatise"" the issue of the ""backstop"" - the EU's proposal to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, if the EU and UK cannot agree new arrangements in time.Under the EU's proposals ""a limited set of EU rules would continue to apply in Northern Ireland as they do today"", Mr Barnier said in a speech."

2018-07-08,David Davis - the maverick minister,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709015118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44398122,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDavid Davis, who has quit as Brexit secretary, had one of the toughest jobs in politics - negotiating Britain's exit from the EU - and he also has one of the most colourful CVs. A former SAS reservist, who grew up on a south London council estate, David Davis is a self-styled political maverick who had carved out a career as a champion of civil liberties before his unexpected return to front-line politics in July 2016 as secretary of state for exiting the EU.He took to the role of negotiating Brexit with characteristic swagger, brushing off accusations from critics that he was too lazy, or lacked the intellectual depth, for such an apparently complex and nuanced task.""What's the requirement of my job? I don't have to be very clever. I don't have to know that much. I do just have to be calm,"" he told LBC radio.The Brexit secretary job might have been unexpected, but as a long-time opponent of Britain's EU membership it was an opportunity he grabbed with both hands. He proved more publicly loyal to Theresa May than fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson, earning the trust of the prime minister as her representative in Brussels, in what have turned out to be fraught talks with his opposite number, Michel Barnier.His former reputation as someone who likes to be the centre of the media's attention - he once dramatically walked out of David Cameron's shadow cabinet and called a by-election - lingers on.His appearances before Hilary Benn's Brexit select committee have become box-office moments at Westminster.On one occasion, Mr Benn tried to pin him down about comments he had made in July 2016 - two days before Mrs May drafted him into the cabinet - when he said the UK would be able negotiate a free-trade area ""massively larger than the EU"" within two years of Brexit.A laughing Mr Davis said the comments had been made before he had become a minister, later adding: ""That was then, this is now.""Some of his former allies on the libertarian left struggled to come to terms with the new, ministerial Mr Davis. Journalist Henry Porter, who often shared a platform with him at debates and campaign events, wrote in the Observer:  ""I came to like him a lot and to admire his bounce and pugnacity. ""Among all the politicians I knew - with the possible exception of [Remain-supporting Tory MP] Dominic Grieve - David possessed the deepest instinct for liberty.""But Brexit clearly mattered far more to Mr Davis than protecting ancient Parliamentary liberties, said Porter, as he lamented the changes he had seen in his friend since taking on ministerial office. ""While I would be happy to be in the jungle or stuck in a lift with him, I would draw the line at being stranded in a planning room with him,"" he said.Date of birth: 21 December, 1948 (69) Most recent post: Secretary of state for exiting the EU, MP for Haltemprice and Howden since 1987Education: Tooting Bec grammar school, Warwick University (Bsc molecular science and computer science), London Business School, Harvard University management school Family: Married Doreen in 1973. Three childrenBefore politics: Senior executive at sugar giant Tate and LyleInitially seen as an ultra-Thatcherite, David Davis was elected to Parliament in 1987, at the age of 38, after a career in management with sugar giant Tate and Lyle. But Mr Davis did not fit the traditional mould of a Tory MP.Despite being a passionate opponent of socialism in all its forms, his political hero is the late Tony Benn, father of Hilary and hero of the radical, Corbynista left.He had a troubled background. ""I was a wild kid,"" he told an audience at the Royal Festival Hall in 2002, where he shared the stage with Mr Benn, something, he said, that would have made his Labour-voting parents very proud. The two bonded over their shared Euroscepticism - but little else - at that event.He got into Warwick University on an army scholarship and trained with the SAS as a reservist to help pay his way. His military background, and fearless attitude, endeared him to Tory grandees such as the late Alan Clark, another of his heroes, as he began his rise through the party ranks in the early 1990s. Over dinner hosted by Clark at his medieval Saltwood Castle, in Kent, Mr Davis agreed to walk along the crumbling ramparts overlooking the ruins of a chapel.""[He] did the 'black' route without turning a hair, then retraced his footsteps, hands in pockets - first time that's ever been done!"" Clark wrote in his diary.""He is an extraordinarily optimistic and self-confident person,"" Tory MP Andrew Mitchell - a long time friend and ally - told the BBC's Newsnight programme's Nick Watt last year.""I remember one of the Cameroons saying to me in exasperation that he was the only person he knows who did not go to Eton but has the same level of self-confidence you get from an Eton education.""Despite his Eurosceptic views, Mr Davis served as a government whip under pro-EU Prime Minister John Major in the early 1990s, attempting to get rebel Tory MPs to support the Maastricht Treaty, which paved the way for closer European integration.He later served as Mr Major's Europe minister, helping to negotiate some of the agreements with Brussels he has since been charged with unpicking.His ""hard man"" image, working-class background and staunch right-wing credentials made him the frontrunner to replace Michael Howard as Conservative leader in 2005 (he had made an unexpected, and unsuccessful tilt at the job in 2001).He lost out to David Cameron, who made him shadow home secretary, where he carved out a distinctive niche for himself as a defender of traditional British freedoms, even though the two men had little time for each other.In 2008, he dramatically resigned his Haltemprice and Howden seat, and his frontbench role, to fight a by-election in protest at Labour's plans for identity cards and 42-day detention without charge.He won easily but rejected a job in the coalition government in 2010 to continue his civil liberties crusade from the backbenches, often in conflict with then Home Secretary Theresa May.He was involved in legal action against the government over Mrs May's data-retention plans - dubbed the ""snoopers' charter"" by critics - when he got the call to join her cabinet.Mr Davis will celebrate his 70th birthday in December, just over three months before Britain officially leaves the EU at the end of March 2019.

During this period the UK will continue to abide by European Court rulings.David Lidington, the Minister for the Cabinet Office, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the European Court of Justice's (ECJ) jurisdiction ""extinguishes"" on 29 March 2019 - at the end of the Article 50 process.Is he right?The UK is expected to leave the European Union next March and then enter a transition period.This period is meant to last until the end of December 2020. The government calls it an implementation period and says it will allow for the ""orderly withdrawal"" of the UK from the EU.During the transition, the UK's relationship with the EU will be similar to what it is now. For example, it will continue to belong to the single market and the customs union. The UK will also continue to be under the full jurisdiction of the ECJ.The draft withdrawal agreement, published by the European Commission in March, sets out the terms of the transition. It said: ""The Court of Justice of the European Union shall continue to have jurisdiction for any proceedings brought before it by the United Kingdom or against the United Kingdom before the end of the transition period.""In January David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, was asked directly in Parliament if the UK would be under the jurisdiction of the European court during the transition.He replied: ""Yes, in that period.""Of course this is all predicated on the government securing a deal on its future relationship with the EU. As Theresa May and others have previously said: ""Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.""So if the government failed to agree post-transition terms with the EU and the UK ended up with a ""no deal"" Brexit, then the UK could leave ECJ jurisdiction in March 2019.But that is not the government's current policy. The Cabinet Office told us Mr Lidington's comments would only apply in a no deal scenario.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

Here is a guide to the ""who, why, and when"".Why is there a contest? Carwyn Jones shocked the Welsh Labour conference in April when he announced he would step down as their leader and first minister at the end of the year.  He said he had been through ""the darkest of times"" - a reference to the death last November of Carl Sargeant, four days after Mr Jones sacked him as communities secretary. Who is in the running?Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford was first to declare, with backing from more than the minimum five AMs needed for the nomination.   Vaughan Gething, Eluned Morgan and Huw Irranca-Davies have also said they want to stand but unless the rules change on nominations not all of them will get onto the ballot paper.When will the winner be named?Welsh Labour will hold a special conference in September to decide the rules of the contest, amid debate over whether it should be one member one vote (OMOV) or an electoral college which gives more weight to the views of MPs, AMs and organisations such as trade unions.   The result is expected around early December, nine years to the month that Carwyn Jones took over from Rhodri Morgan.Why is there a contest?Neil Hamilton was ousted as leader of the five-strong UKIP group in May by Caroline Jones, who promised a more collaborative approach to Senedd politics.  The former Tory MP vowed to regain the group leadership, prompting UKIP HQ in London to step in and order a ballot of UKIP members in Wales to settle the row.Who is in the running?Neil Hamilton and Caroline Jones have both declared their intention to stand, along with Gareth Bennett, who has vowed to campaign to abolish the assembly.When will the winner be named?UKIP has said it expects to announce the result of the membership ballot by the end of July.Why is there a contest?Andrew RT Davies quit the leadership last Wednesday feeling he had lost the support of his colleagues.  He had been condemned within the party the previous Friday for accusing firms such as Airbus of undermining Brexit by voicing their concerns about the impact on trade.    But the ardent supporter of Brexit later told BBC Wales he had been aware of moves to unseat him for some time. Who is in the running?Interim leader Paul Davies has said he would like the job on a permanent basis, and Suzy Davies has also put her name forward.  While both backed Remain in the 2016 referendum on Europe, former Welsh Secretary David Jones has said the next assembly group leader should reflect what he called the ""overwhelmingly Eurosceptic"" views of grassroots members in Wales.When will the winner be named?A postal ballot of Welsh Conservative members will take place in August, and the result declared on 6 September. Why is there a contest?Plaid rules allow for a leadership contest every two years, and the window for a challenge closed on Wednesday.  Despite Leanne Wood's high profile in TV election debates in recent years, there has been unhappiness within party ranks at the apparent lack of progress in terms of AMs and MPs elected.   In June Ms Wood said she would welcome a contest and felt ""very"" confident of winning it.Who is in the running?Earlier in June Rhun ap Iorwerth said he had ""no plans"" to challenge Ms Wood, but has announced a bid saying she had invited a debate on Plaid's leadership and supporters had urged him to stand.  On Monday, Adam Price called on Ms Wood to share the leadership with a man to boost Plaid's fortunes or face the prospect of a challenge.  She turned the proposal down and Mr Price has now thrown his hat into the ring too.When will the winner be named?Plaid Cymru says it will announce a timetable shortly.The Welsh Lib Dems had a leadership election last November, when Jane Dodds beat Elizabeth Evans in a vote of the membership.   She took over from Mark Williams, the last remaining Welsh Lib Dem MP who stepped down after losing his Ceredigion seat at the 2017 general election.   With the sole Lib Dem AM Kirsty Williams serving in the Welsh Government as education secretary, the party changed its rules which previously said the Welsh leader had to be an AM or MP.    "
2018-07-08,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709015118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-08,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709015118/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

He has since said he is a convert to the Brexit cause. His appointment follows the promotion of staunch Leave supporter Dominic Raab to the cabinet as Brexit secretary - but the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said most of the top jobs in government were now held by ministers who had backed Remain.There are potentially dozens of Tory rebels who want to halt Mrs May's Chequers compromise but it is not clear how committed they are, added our correspondent, and Monday's resignations might have left her with a more pliable and supportive cabinet.  Her future now depends on how Brussels reacts to her Brexit proposals - and what Mr Davis and Mr Johnson plan to do next, she added.Both men had signed up on Friday to Mrs May's blueprint for Brexit - but 48 hours later, first Mr Davis and then Mr Johnson said they could not commit themselves to promoting the plans as they did not believe in them.Brexit minister Steve Baker and two ministerial aides also resigned.After his appointment as Health and Social Care Secretary was announced by Downing Street, Mr Hancock said: ""Really looking forward to joining @DHSCgovuk at such an important time for our great NHS. I can't wait to get started.""Attorney General Jeremy Wright is the new culture secretary, with backbencher Geoffrey Cox replacing him as attorney general."

The prime minister's official spokesman said she would fight any attempt to oust her as prime minister if the required 48 Tory MPs called for a contest.She earlier faced her critics at a packed meeting of backbench Conservative MPs, many of whom share Mr Johnson's concerns about her Brexit stance.Loud applause could be heard at the end of the 1922 Committee meeting, which the PM attended for just over an hour.Leaving the gathering, leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said he did not think there would be a confidence vote over Mrs May.But ministerial aide Chris Green resigned his position as a parliamentary private secretary to the Department for Transport after the meeting, saying in a letter to Mrs May that she had confirmed his fears that ""we would not really leave the EU"" under her proposals.Mr Johnson does not pull any punches, saying Brexit ""should be about opportunity and hope"" and a ""chance to do things differently"", but ""that dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt"".He claims crucial decisions have been postponed, including preparations for a ""no-deal"" scenario, ""with the result that we appear to be heading for a semi-Brexit, with large parts of the economy still locked in the EU system, but with no UK control over that system"". The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards.There have been differences within the Conservatives over how far the UK should prioritise the economy by compromising on issues such as leaving the remit of the European Court of Justice and ending free movement of people.Theresa May only has a majority in Parliament with the support of the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, so any split raises questions about whether her plan could survive a Commons vote. She took her entire cabinet to her country residence on Friday to try to get agreement on a UK vision for post-Brexit relations. An agreement was announced after the 12-hour meeting, but many Brexiteers have been unhappy with the deal which they think will lead to the ""worst of both worlds"". The man leading the UK's negotiating team, David Davis, resigned late on Sunday night, saying that he did not agree with the UK's proposals, so was the wrong person to be going into negotiations with them.He told the BBC that he thought the UK was giving away ""too much, too easily"" and predicted that the European Union would be demanding more concessions in talks.Mr Davis, who has been Brexit Secretary since Mrs May became prime minister in 2016, said he had made compromises since taking on the role, but this was ""one compromise too far"".Speaking in a boisterous House of Commons, Mrs May defended the Brexit plan agreed on Friday, which would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, but not services, after Brexit.She paid tribute to Mr Johnson's ""passion"" in championing a global Britain after Brexit and Mr Davis' work in steering through key Brexit legislation. But she told MPs: ""We do not agree on the best way to deliver our shared commitments to honour the result of the referendum."" Mrs May told MPs that the plan agreed by the cabinet at Chequers was the basis of a ""responsible and credible"" offer to restart renegotiations with the EU.But she warned that if the EU did not engage with her plan, there was a ""serious risk"" of the UK leaving in March 2019 without a deal in a ""disorderly"" manner. Under her proposal, a treaty would be signed committing the UK to ""continued harmonisation"" with EU rules - avoiding friction at the UK-EU border, including Northern Ireland.But Parliament would oversee the UK's trade policy and have the ability to ""choose"" to diverge from the EU rules. Freedom of movement would come to an end but a ""mobility framework"" would ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to study and work in each other's territories.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson and Mr Davis had abandoned a ""sinking ship"", shattering the ""illusion of unity"" initially surrounding the Chequers plan.There was a crisis in government, he said, adding: ""It is clear this government cannot secure a good deal for Britain."" Mrs May came under pressure from prominent Tory Brexiteers on the backbenches, with ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith urging her to rule out further concessions during the talks.The European Commission declined to comment on Mr Davis's exit but Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said he hoped a change in faces might lead to a change in policy. Politicians come and go but the problems they have created for people remain. I can only regret that the idea of #Brexit has not left with Davis and Johnson. But...who knows?End of Twitter post  by @eucopresidentThe UK and the EU have been negotiating Brexit terms for more than a year now and have been hoping to agree broad aims for their future relationship in October.The aim of the Chequers away day had been to agree the UK position - after two years of discussion - but the resignations have put a question mark over that.The uncertainty in the UK comes before the plan is officially put to the European Union, who may well be unhappy with aspects of it they have previously referred to as ""cherry picking"".One other element of Friday's agreement worth noting is that it pledged to speed up preparations for the UK to be ready to leave the EU without a Brexit deal in March next year.Nigel Farage has said he will consider standing for the UKIP leadership for a fourth time when it becomes vacant in March next year, if Brexit is not ""back on track"" and the Chequers agreement still stands.He backed Boris Johnson, saying the former foreign secretary had the chance to ""save Brexit"" by moving against the prime minister."
2018-07-09,Raab replaces Davis as Brexit secretary,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709212819/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44763998,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDominic Raab has been appointed Brexit secretary by Theresa May after David Davis resigned from the government.Mr Raab, who is currently housing minister, was a prominent Leave campaigner during the 2016 referendum.Mr Davis quit late on Sunday night, saying Theresa May had ""given away too much too easily"". The 44-year old Mr Raab, a lawyer before becoming an MP in 2010, will now take over day-to-day negotiations with the EU's Michel Barnier.The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards.There have been differences within the Conservative Party over how far the UK should prioritise the economy by compromising on issues such as leaving the remit of the European Court of Justice and ending free movement of people.The simple question for Davis, by Laura KuenssbergWhat sticks out the most from my interview with David Davis this morning is a very simple question we asked. Is the prime minister's plan really leaving the EU? ""I don't think so,"" he said.That is the sentiment that's widely shared among the Tory party, and perhaps among many voters too. And guess what? It doesn't always matter which side of the referendum they were on either.Some former Remainers say ""look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do this, then for goodness sake let's do it properly or just stay in"".From some Leavers, like Mr Davis, you also get ""look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do it, then for goodness sake let's do it properly"".Mrs May's Conservative Party only has a majority in Parliament with the support in key votes of the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, so any split raises questions about whether her plan could survive a Commons vote - and has also led to renewed questions about whether she will face a challenge to her position.Mr Raab has served in government since after the 2015 election, initially working in the Ministry of Justice before moving to the communities department in January.The European Commission has declined to comment on the change of personnel, saying it would continue to negotiate with ""goodwill"" to try and secure an agreement on the terms of the UK's exit and future relations.Asked how much of a problem Mr Davis's resignation was for the future of the negotiations, a spokesman replied: ""It is not for us, we are here to work."" Mr Davis said he could not remain in his post because he no longer believed in the plan for the UK's future relations with the EU which was backed by the cabinet on Friday.He said he hoped his resignation would make it easier for the UK to resist EU attempts to extract further concessions - but he insisted he was not seeking to undermine or challenge the prime minister. In an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Davis said Mr Raab would be ""very effective"" in the post. Reflecting on his resignation, he said he had lived with compromises in Brexit policy for two years but there came a point where these went ""too far"".""I worry about the fine detail and that it will not work out as we hope,"" he said. Asked what he would say to colleagues who thought it was time to remove Theresa May, he replied it was ""not a good idea"" - insisting that she was a ""good prime minister"". Junior Brexit minister Steve Baker, who also resigned overnight, launched an attack on government policy. He told the BBC's Daily Politics that he had been ""blindsided"" by the Brexit proposal agreed at Chequers.Mr Baker also said that he and his team had been preparing a white paper ""which did not accord with what has been put to the cabinet at Chequers"".The mood at Westminster, by Iain WatsonThe atmosphere is volatile. The long-standing Leave supporters of the European Research Group of Tory MPs will have two meetings today - either side of the PM's address to her own MPs - to discuss next steps.Views differ on whether the government's position is simply impractical - ""the worst of both worlds"" - or whether it actually breaches a manifesto commitment by offering a customs union in all but name.But there is agreement amongst many Brexiteers that the policy should change, and quickly. It is less clear how they will bring that about. If there is not a direct triggering of a leadership contest, what are the options?One is that Brexiteers go ""on strike"" and refuse to back government policy in parliament, weakening her premiership unless she changes course.Another is that backbench Brexiteers put more pressure on like-minded cabinet colleagues to follow David Davis out the door.Speaking to the BBC last week, Mr Raab said the process of negotiating Brexit was ""rocky"" but what mattered was getting there in the end, which would require ""flexibility and pragmatism"". He told the Political Thinking podcast that he was ""relaxed"" about the UK leaving without a deal and it was ""not something I would fear"". Conservative MPs welcomed the appointment of Mr Raab, who has a black belt in karate, one describing him as a ""highly capable"" figure with a clear attention to detail. But Labour said a new man fronting the negotiations ""changed nothing"". ""The deep division at the heart of the Conservative Party has broken out in public and plunged this government into crisis,"" said shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer. ""It is now clearer than ever that Theresa May does not have the authority to negotiate for Britain or deliver a Brexit deal that protects jobs and the economy.""Asked whether Mr Raab would be in charge of the talks, No 10 said Mrs May had ""always been, from the outset, the lead negotiator"". But a spokesman said there was a ""huge body of work to be done, in terms of preparations for the UK leaving the EU and that obviously includes no-deal preparations as well"". Mrs May will address Parliament later on the plan agreed at Chequers on Friday as well as address Tory MPs as she seeks to keep her Brexit strategy on track.Ahead of Monday's statement, opposition MPs and peers - as well as Tory MPs - are being offered briefings by Downing Street on the detail of the Chequers statement. A spokesman for the European Research Group of eurosceptic Tory MPs told the BBC that involving opposition MPs had caused considerable anger and was the government's ""stupidest mistake"". And Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the group, likened a PM relying on opposition MPs to the children's story in which the gingerbread man accepts the offer of a ride across a river from a fox, only to get eaten by it."
2018-07-09,David Davis lifts lid on Brexit tensions,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709212819/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44767321,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIs it really leaving at all? ""I don't think so."" Forget the politicking and the crazy, bitter briefings. If the past few weeks has been like watching the Conservative Party have a nervous breakdown in front of our eyes, this morning they are truly losing the plot. Set aside the psychodrama about minicab cards, late night phone calls, toasts over dinner at Chequers, a foreign secretary no one can find. More of that later no doubt. What sticks out the most from my interview with David Davis this morning is a very simple question we asked. Is the prime minister's plan really leaving the EU? ""I don't think so"", he said. That is the sentiment that's widely shared among the Tory party, and perhaps among many voters too. And guess what? It doesn't always matter which side of the referendum they were on either. Some former Remainers say ""look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do this, then for goodness sake let's do it properly or just stay in"". From some Leavers, like Mr Davis, you also get ""look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do it, then for goodness sake let's do it properly"". Yes, I did mean to write the same line twice just then. We are a million miles from Tory unity, but weirdly there is some agreement at the fringes of the party that the current compromise is, as compromises so often are, something that pleases hardly anyone. And it would be better for No 10 just to go the ""full Norway"", a close relationship with the EU not a Viking experience, or the ""Canada plus"", a free trade agreement not a ten-day tour of the Rockies, or frankly, not leave at all. David Davis' resignation on its own - so far - is not going to bring down the government. It could well unleash a host of events that leads us to that place, but we're still a long way from that. But what it does do is take the lid off the boiling pot of frustration, angst, ambition and despair you find in pockets of the governing party and a sense on both sides that this kind of Brexit might not be worth it. That's not to say most Tory MPs are in the mood for a giant ruckus. Most of them in fact probably back the Chequers compromise, grateful at last that the Cabinet - well most of them - found agreement. And believing, quite possibly correctly, that the vast majority of the public aren't paying attention to much of the flouncing in any case, so can ministers please, please, please, please, get on with it and just shut up. For Number 10, the Chequers plan is a clever enough compromise they believe can get the EU on to the next phase of negotiations. Remember - all of this is happening in order that officials can get down to actually negotiating the nitty-gritty of the long term relationship. It is perfectly possible that within 72 hours or so it is situation normal, well normal-ish. But David Davis was an ""active backbencher"", who delighted in making waves on the issues he cares about for many years. If he thinks Theresa May's Brexit does not mean Brexit, expect plenty of trouble ahead even if today's particular storm passes before the heat wave breaks. "
2018-07-09,Brexit Secretary David Davis resigns,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709212819/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44761056,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDavid Davis, who has been leading UK negotiations to leave the EU, has quit his role as Brexit SecretaryHe told the BBC that he was no longer the best person to deliver the PM's Brexit plan - agreed by the cabinet on Friday - as he did not ""believe"" in it. He said the ""career-ending"" decision was a personal one but he felt the UK was ""giving away too much and too easily"" to the EU in the negotiations.Mrs May said she did not agree but thanked him for his work.The resignation is a blow to Mrs May as she seeks to win over Eurosceptic MPs to her proposed Brexit vision, which would form the basis of the UK's position in on-going talks with the EU.Dominic Raab, who campaigned for Leave during the UK's 2016 EU referendum, has been promoted from housing minister to take over from Mr Davis.The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards.There have been differences within the Conservative Party over how far the UK should prioritise the economy by compromising on issues such as leaving the remit of the European Court of Justice and ending free movement of people.Mrs May's Conservative Party only has a majority in Parliament with the support in key votes of the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, so any split raises questions about whether her plan could survive a Commons vote - and has also led to renewed questions about whether she will face a challenge to her position. In a sign of how delicately positioned the numbers are on Brexit strategy it has emerged that the government has taken the unusual step of arranging a briefing for opposition Labour MPs on the detail of the Brexit plan agreed on Friday. In his resignation letter, Mr Davis told Mrs May that ""the current trend of policy and tactics"" was making it ""look less and less likely"" that the UK would leave the customs union and single market.He said he was ""unpersuaded"" that the government's negotiating approach ""will not just lead to further demands for concessions"" from Brussels.Mr Davis, who was appointed Brexit Secretary in 2016, said: ""The general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one.""In her reply, Mrs May said: ""I do not agree with your characterisation of the policy we agreed at cabinet on Friday.""She said she was ""sorry"" he was leaving but would ""like to thank you warmly for everything you have done... to shape our departure from the EU"".Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he had objected to Theresa May's plan at the Chequers meeting, telling cabinet colleagues at the outset that he was ""the odd man out"".He said it was ""not tenable"" for him to stay in post and try to persuade Tory MPs to back the policy when he did not think it was ""workable"".""The best person to do this is someone who really believes in it, not me.""He said he feared the EU would seek to further water down the UK's plans and his resignation would make it easier for the UK to resist attempts to extract further concessions.Mr Davis told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that he had been compromising for two years and that the latest plan was ""a compromise too far"".But Mr Davis insisted he continued to back Theresa May, saying that if he ""wanted to bring her down"", the time would have been after she failed to win last year's general election outright. A leadership contest now would be ""the wrong thing to do"", adding: ""I won't throw my hat into the ring.""Eurosceptic MP Steve Baker has also resigned. He played a leading role in the Brexit campaign in the run up to the 2016 referendum. He was promoted to the Department for Exiting the EU as a parliamentary under-secretary in June last year.Conservative MP Peter Bone hailed Mr Davis's resignation as a ""principled and brave decision"", adding: ""The PM's proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable.""Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left.""David Davis resigning at such a crucial time shows @Theresa_May has no authority left and is incapable of delivering Brexit. With her Government in chaos, if she clings on, it's clear she's more interested in hanging on for her own sake than serving the people of our country.End of Twitter post  by @jeremycorbynBy BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergAfter many months of rumours that he would pull the plug, David Davis has actually quit as Brexit Secretary. His unhappiness in government has been no secret for some time, but after the prime minister's Chequers agreement with cabinet ministers to pursue closer ties with the EU than he desired, he found his position untenable. After a visit to Downing Street on Sunday he concluded that he had no choice but to walk.The move, while not completely surprising, throws doubt on to how secure the government's Brexit strategy is. Read Laura's full blog hereMrs May is due to address MPs on Monday afternoon and is expected to tell MPs that the strategy agreed by the cabinet at Chequers on Friday is the ""right Brexit"" for Britain.Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said it would be ""very difficult"" for Mrs May's plans to win the backing of MPs without Mr Davis.He told BBC 5 Live: ""These proposals will have to come to the House of Commons in legislation and the question is 'will they command support from Conservative MPs?'""And I think without David Davis there, without his imprimatur, it will be very difficult for them to get the support of Conservative MPs and therefore the prime minister would be well advised to reconsider them.""BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understands Mr Davis was ""furious"" after a meeting at No 10 earlier on Sunday and ""concluded he could not stay in post"".The resignation came as people awaited the verdicts of senior figures from the Brexit side of the 2016 referendum.  There has yet been no on the record comment from Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, while Environment Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC on Sunday he was urging Tory MPs to support Mrs May.One of the leading pro-Remain Conservative MPs Anna Soubry did not refer directly to Mr Davis's resignation, but tweeted it was ""not the time for egos, grandstanding and blind ideology"". The director-general of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, said the resignation was ""a blow"", adding that business had welcomed the agreement of ministers on Friday.Meanwhile, some Remain-supporting politicians said the resignation was evidence of the need for a second referendum.Lord Adonis, a prominent backer of a second vote, tweeted: ""People's Vote to put Brexit out of its misery a big step closer after DD's resignation. Now the Brexiteers holding Mrs May hostage are falling out, there isn't a majority for any withdrawal treaty in Parliament.""The Liberal Democrats called on people to sign a petition for a vote on the proposed deal, adding: ""The resignation of David Davis is yet more evidence of the chaos of this Tory Brexit. You deserve the final say"".Nigel Farage congratulated Mr Davis for quitting and called for Mrs May to be replaced as prime minister, accusing her of being ""duplicitous"" and claiming her response ""shows she is controlled by the civil service""."

She said she had tried to drive to her mother's house after drinking two or three glasses of wine. The former probation board member, who was elected in 2016, was given a 20 month driving ban, £1,000 fine and £100 victim surcharge while prosecution costs of £620 were awarded against her.The committee's recommendation follows an investigation by the watchdog for assembly members, standards commissioner Sir Roderick Evans.In written evidence to the commissioner, Ms Passmore said she did not deliberately fail to give a sample and was distressed after not being able to use her asthma medication properly.In evidence to the standards commissioner, Ms Passmore said she had drunk two or three glasses of wine in Cardiff, having left her car at the assembly car park.After collecting her car later, Ms Passmore said she suffered an asthma attack and took a high dose of medication, prednisone.On her way to her mother's house her car broke down in the St Mellons area of the city and, while waiting for the AA breakdown service, the police arrived.A report from the standards committee said the police asked Ms Passmore to give a sample of breath; she tried but was unable to do so.She was arrested and taken to a police station where she was asked again to provide a sample of her breath for analysis.Again she tried, but was unable to do so, the report added.The committee said such a breach of the code of conduct for AMs should carry a 21-day exclusion, reduced to 14 days because the member had shown remorse and referred herself to the commissioner.Ms Passmore said in her evidence she did not know why she was unable to provide a sample.""I did not intentionally fail to do so and it may be that my asthmatic condition was a contributory factor to my failure,"" she said.Ms Passmore said that, during the process, she was ""very distressed"" - exacerbated because she could not access her medication.When it was eventually offered ""I was prevented from taking the required and necessary dose"", she said. ""I believe this and the fear of my condition being left untreated and in addition to being in shock after the attack strongly contributed to being unable to provide a sample as required.""A doctor came to the police station to examine Ms Passmore, gave her oxygen and summoned an ambulance.""On the way to hospital I was put on a post medication drip. I was detained in hospital until the Saturday afternoon,"" she added.The proposed sanction will need to be approved by AMs before it comes into effect - it is expected this will take place on 18 July.If a motion for her exclusion is passed, because of recess, the sanction will come into effect on 18 September.If it happens Ms Passmore would be the second AM to be excluded, after UKIP AM Michelle Brown was banned from the Senedd for a week over a racial slur she used to describe Labour MP Chuka Umunna.In a personal statement on Monday, Ms Passmore said she assumed responsibility and accepted the committee's recommendation to exclude her.""Whilst I could often be described in public as a self-confident female politician, I have had to encounter private struggles that I have found difficult to master,"" she said.Ms Passmore added that she remained ""committed to doing my job for the people who elected me, to the best of my ability""."

Equipment procurement currently accounts for about a quarter of the annual defence budget which, according to the National Audit Office, totalled £35.3bn in 2016-7.The spending watchdog warned last year of a potential black hole of up to £20bn in the Ministry of Defence's 10-year £179bn equipment and support budget. A new report suggests there is an opportunity to ""revolutionise"" innovation in the defence sector by capitalising on the skills and knowhow of the thousands of veterans who retire every year.The Centre for Entrepreneurs said the UK had to learn from the United States and Israel, among others, about how best to unleash the entrepreneurial potential of its service leavers. Its proposals include:While there are many veterans working in business, including in the defence and security sector, the report said those able to develop high-tech ideas with the greatest growth potential were often not being identified.It said institutions such as London Business School, Warwick Business School, or Cranfield University were best placed to run the training camps because of their experience in executive leadership programmes. The report says all new innovative technology that emerges through such programmes should be tested in military environments, ideally overseen by veterans with commercial expertise. ""All too often in defence, the end-users' experience and insight does not reach those innovating new products,"" said its author Matt Smith, director of the Centre for Entrepreneurs.""Worse still, innovations rarely get tested with service personnel before they are expected to use them in the field.""The Ministry of Defence, the report added, should learn from GCHQ and the City of London about how to partner with specialist organisations to set up innovation hubs and business incubators.The Defence and Security Accelerator, which is based at Porton Down, Wiltshire, has a remit to support innovative research and take new projects, including from small firms and start-ups, to market.But the report suggested its model of procurement ""stifles competition and limits the scope of innovative thinking"" and it should be offering equity-free investment as well as office space and guidance.Mr Williamson said the defence sector was vital to the UK economy, providing specialist and highly-skilled employment in every part of the country. He said a report written by former defence minister Philip Dunne - which calculated the defence industry had annual sales of £22bn and exports of £7bn - showed its reach and importance after Brexit.Mr Dunne said the industry should seize the opportunities to ""adapt and improve its own processes to help meet the challenges of the high-tech defence future"".

2018-07-09,Government outsourcing approach 'flawed',https://web.archive.org//web/20180709212819/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44759910,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government is prioritising cost over quality when outsourcing public sector contracts, leading to worse services, a committee of MPs says.The collapse of construction giant Carillion had exposed ""fundamental flaws"" in the outsourcing process, the Commons Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee said.When Carillion failed in January, it had 420 UK public sector contracts.MPs said its collapse had ""badly shaken public confidence in outsourcing"". But it said the government's approach of ""spending as little money as possible"" meant that contractors were being forced to ""take unacceptable levels of financial risk"". ""Ultimately, this has led to worse public services as companies have been sent a clear signal that cost, rather than quality of services, is the government's consistent priority,"" the committee's report said.According to the committee's calculations, the government has had to renegotiate more than £120m of contracts since the beginning of 2016 to make sure that the public services provided continued.The report also found that the government was unable to provide ""significant evidence"" for its key claim for outsourcing, that it provides ""better services for less public money"".It said this was particularly true for private finance initiative (PFI) deals which are used to fund many public services such as new schools or hospitals.The committee said that the government had admitted that the ""entire (PFI) structure is to keep the debt off the balance sheet"".The MPs are urging the government to be more transparent about how it decides to outsource and award contracts. It also wants ministers to commit to ""realistic assessments of cost"" when it outsources contracts.Committee chairman Sir Bernard Jenkin said it was ""staggering"" that the government had misunderstood the costs of contracts.""It has accepted bids below what it costs to provide the service, so that the contract has had to be renegotiated.""He warned that a crisis like Carillion could happen again unless the government acted.A Cabinet Office spokesman said the government would respond formally to the report in ""due course"".""The government is committed to ensuring a healthy and diverse marketplace of companies bidding for government contracts, and we have recently announced a wide package of new measures to further improve how we work with our vendors,"" he added."

The proposals, announced by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, aim to make it easier to recharge an electric car rather than refuel petrol or diesel vehicles.They include: Mr Grayling said the proposed measures would mean the UK having ""one of the most comprehensive support packages for zero-emission vehicles in the world"".""The prize is not just a cleaner and healthier environment but a UK economy fit for the future and the chance to win a substantial slice of a market estimated to be worth up to £7.6 trillion by 2050,"" he said.The government's Road to Zero strategy has been delayed by a dispute over what sort of cars should be allowed to be sold after 2040.The government's climate change advisers say carbon emissions from vehicles must be stopped by 2040 if the UK is to achieve its demanding long-term targets for protecting the climate. That implies that cars after that date should be fuelled by electricity or hydrogen. But car makers like Toyota, which have specialised in hybrid petrol/electric vehicles, have been arguing that as most journeys are fairly short it doesn't make sense to carry a battery big enough to make a 200-mile trip.It seems they have won their argument that hybrids should still be able to be sold - to the dismay of environmentalists who say the task of tackling carbon emissions from transport is going much too slowly anyway.The Campaign for Better Transport welcomed plans to increase charge points but said ""overall the strategy fails to match the urgency of the situation"".It said new petrol and diesel cars should be banned by 2030 - ten years earlier than the government's proposal - and criticised the ""confusion"" over the future of hybrids.The government has said it sees a role for hybrid technology in its new strategy. In the first six months of this year, electric vehicles made up only 5.5% of the UK's new car market, compared with 4.3% over the same period in 2017.The RAC Foundation, a motoring research charity, found that growth in the electric car industry was hampered by a lack of widespread, reliable and easy-to-use public charging points.Research by the AA showed eight out of 10 drivers see the lack of charging points as a stumbling block to buying an electric car.The motoring organisation said the proposals were ""a step in the right direction"", adding that ""there is still much to do to wean drivers off petrol and diesel cars"".

Two childrenBefore politics: Foreign office lawyer. He was the lead on a team focusing on bringing war criminals to justice at The HagueHe was appointed civil liberties minister in the Ministry of Justice following David Cameron's general election victory in 2015.In 2017, he was branded ""offensive"" by then Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after saying ""the typical user of a food bank is not someone that's languishing in poverty, it's someone who has a cash flow problem"".He played a prominent role in the Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, but was sacked from his junior ministerial role by Theresa May when she took over as prime minister following Mr Cameron's resignation.During her January 2018 reshuffle there were reports that Mr Raab had deliberately been sidelined as part of the ""new generation"" of Tory talent seen as a threat to the ""old guard"".Downing Street said his appointment as Brexit Secretary, an area the PM has made a personal priority, showed the ""high regard"" in which she held him.He proved a loyal pro-Brexit voice on the backbenches, and kept the Leave campaign flag flying as co-founder of the Change Britain campaign group.He was rewarded with a more senior role in the Ministry of Justice following last year's general election, and moved to the job of housing minister in January.There was further controversy when he suggested immigration was driving up house prices, with the Office for National Statistics demanding that he publish the study on which his claims were based. In May this year, his diary secretary was caught up in a Daily Mirror sting.He dismissed the paper's allegations that the 20-year-old had met men through a ""sugar daddy"" website as ""a storm in a teacup"".He said his first concern was for the welfare of the woman, who was suspended from her civil service job.The ""most salacious"" thing in the newspaper's story was an ""untrue"" claim that he ordered the same lunch every day, he told BBC News.The diary secretary was quoted as saying he ordered the same meal every day from Pret A Manger: ""He has the chicken Caesar and bacon baguette, SuperFruit pot and the Vitamin Volcano smoothie, every day. He is so weird. It's the Dom Raab Special."""

He called it ""problematic"" and said it was one of the reasons he has decided to resign.Mr Davis's resignation was followed by that of the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - also over the government's Brexit strategy. But what is the common rulebook and why are some Brexiteers unhappy with it?Currently, EU member states have to follow the same standards and regulations. This is part of the single market rulebook on goods and services.Harmonised standards exist in all sorts of areas, such as chemicals, emissions, pharmaceuticals and food safety.The government wants to maintain parts of this rulebook to allow ""frictionless trade at the border"" after Brexit.Some of the detail was contained in the three page government document, released after the Chequers summit.The document says a treaty would be signed to allow for ""ongoing harmonisation on goods"" including agriculture and food.It also said the UK ""would strike different arrangements for services"".That suggests the UK is not looking to follow the model of the EEA (European Economic Area) countries - like Norway and Iceland. They are not EU members but they follow the single market rulebook on both goods and services.Services are very important to UK businesses: In 2016 the UK exported £106bn in services to the EU and the four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries. That compares to £158bn in goods exports.The government also believes the proposals will allow it to negotiate its own free trade deals with other countries, such as the US - but that is disputed by some Brexiteers. The UK will lose its place in the European Council, its representation at the European Commission and all of its 73 MEPs. The fear amongst some is that the UK will become a rule taker and no longer a rule maker.But the government says that if the EU decides to change the rulebook in the future, it will be the UK Parliament that decides whether to accept the changes.Others, like Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, believe the proposal strengthens parliamentary sovereignty:""There's a world of difference between parliament being unlikely to vote down a new regulation and parliament being unable to vote down a regulation"", he said. ""Unable is where we are now.""But it's not clear what the consequences would be if the UK rejected any changes to the rulebook and standards consequently started to diverge, according to Jill Rutter from the Institute for Government think tank.""Imagine the UK didn't like a change to regulations in the chemical industry"", she says.""In order to maintain access we might have to set up our own regulatory body or set up new arrangements to check chemical goods at the border.""That could mean big set-up costs."" The government document acknowledges that if Parliament voted to reject any changes to the rulebook, it would have to recognise ""that this would have consequences"". In her response to David Davis's resignation letter, Theresa May said not signing up to certain rules would lead to consequences for ""market access, security cooperation or the frictionless border.""Please upgrade your browserThere's also the question of disputes and how to resolve them.The UK wants to set up a joint committee and independent arbitration in the event of a dispute over the rulebook. Cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom says the dispute mechanism would be ""equally presided over by UK courts and the European Court of Justice"".But the detail of how this would work in practice is still to be worked out.More detail is expected in the coming days when the government publishes its Brexit White Paper.Of course this is all predicated on the UK securing a Brexit deal with the EU.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

It is a task that few historians will conclude Mr Johnson achieved. On Monday, he was supposed to be chairing a summit in London on the Western Balkans to show the UK's continuing commitment to European security. Instead, foreign ministers tweeted their frustration at the absence of their host as he agonised about his future. This week is a moment when Britain's voice is meant to be heard - at the Nato summit in Brussels and during President Trump's visit to the UK. There is diplomacy to be done after the death of a British national from what is suspected to be a Russian nerve agent attack, a shocking event that has been overshadowed by the latest dramas over Brexit. Instead, the departure of Mr Johnson will add to the uncertainty that diplomats and politicians from overseas feel about Britain's foreign policy. When Mr Johnson was appointed two years ago, there was hope that his charm and intelligence could turn into statesmanship. Diplomats warmed to this multilingual maverick - here at last was a foreign secretary with some political star quality, who could get Britain heard on the international stage. And certainly at early international meetings, I watched as Mr Johnson was mobbed by fellow ministers seeking selfies with a tousle-haired phenomenon tipped as a future prime minister. But soon hope turned to disappointment. The repeated gaffes and inappropriate remarks often undermined any progress Mr Johnson made with Britain's allies and opponents. There were the jokes about dead bodies in Libya and the recitation of inappropriate verses by Rudyard Kipling in Myanmar. And there was his inaccurate suggestion that the detained British Iranian national Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe had been in Iran training journalists, which her family and supporters said had damaged their campaign to secure her release. Of course, some of the jokes worked and some politicians overseas warmed to the entertaining foreign minister from Britain. There were times when Mr Johnson was an effective minister for foreign affairs. I travelled with him to Libya last year and he met the right people, said the right things, caused no offence and placed the UK firmly in the mix as an international player in that part of north Africa. There were moments in other diplomatic forums, such as meetings with Burmese officials at the United Nations, where Mr Johnson's charm kept the show on the road by sheer force of personality. But there was often frustration at the lack of substance. Foreign envoys would sometimes tell me they couldn't fill their telegrams home simply with jokes written by Boris Johnson. On one occasion, President Sisi of Egypt simply walked out of a meeting with a rather bemused foreign secretary simply because the conversation did not get beyond the pleasantries. Above all, Mr Johnson struggled to set out clearly what the government's ""global Britain"" foreign policy actually meant. His focus on women's education and saving elephants rarely formed part of a bigger picture. What is Britain's response to the rise of countries such as China and India? What is Britain's thinking on the long term pressures of migration from sub-Saharan Africa, where a demographic explosion is expected in coming decades? What is the solution to the government's contradictory policy towards the conflict in Yemen, where Britain sells arms to one side, Saudi Arabia, while giving foreign aid to the other, the civilians left injured and hungry by the fighting? What is Britain's approach to issues such as Syria and North Korea? These are all questions that still require answers. And that is on top of the questions posed by Brexit and Britain's uncertain relationship with an increasingly independent-minded United States led by Donald Trump. The former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted on Monday that Britain ""used to be a nation providing leadership to the world - now, it can't even provide leadership to itself"".British diplomats would challenge such a sweeping assertion and cite the way the UK convinced 28 countries to expel 150 Russian diplomats after the Salisbury nerve agent attack as an example of global leadership. But the question remains: what is British foreign policy? And it is a question that Boris Johnson's successor will have to answer. "
2018-07-09,The maverick minister,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709212819/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44398122,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDavid Davis, who has quit as Brexit secretary, had one of the toughest jobs in politics - negotiating Britain's exit from the EU - and he also has one of the most colourful CVs. A former SAS reservist, who grew up on a south London council estate, David Davis is a self-styled political maverick who had carved out a career as a champion of civil liberties before his unexpected return to front-line politics in July 2016 as secretary of state for exiting the EU.He took to the role of negotiating Brexit with characteristic swagger, brushing off accusations from critics that he was too lazy, or lacked the intellectual depth, for such an apparently complex and nuanced task.""What's the requirement of my job? I don't have to be very clever. I don't have to know that much. I do just have to be calm,"" he told LBC radio.The Brexit secretary job might have been unexpected, but as a long-time opponent of Britain's EU membership it was an opportunity he grabbed with both hands. He proved more publicly loyal to Theresa May than fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson, earning the trust of the prime minister as her representative in Brussels, in what have turned out to be fraught talks with his opposite number, Michel Barnier.His former reputation as someone who likes to be the centre of the media's attention - he once dramatically walked out of David Cameron's shadow cabinet and called a by-election - lingers on.His appearances before Hilary Benn's Brexit select committee have become box-office moments at Westminster.On one occasion, Mr Benn tried to pin him down about comments he had made in July 2016 - two days before Mrs May drafted him into the cabinet - when he said the UK would be able negotiate a free-trade area ""massively larger than the EU"" within two years of Brexit.A laughing Mr Davis said the comments had been made before he had become a minister, later adding: ""That was then, this is now.""Some of his former allies on the libertarian left struggled to come to terms with the new, ministerial Mr Davis. Journalist Henry Porter, who often shared a platform with him at debates and campaign events, wrote in the Observer:  ""I came to like him a lot and to admire his bounce and pugnacity. ""Among all the politicians I knew - with the possible exception of [Remain-supporting Tory MP] Dominic Grieve - David possessed the deepest instinct for liberty.""But Brexit clearly mattered far more to Mr Davis than protecting ancient Parliamentary liberties, said Porter, as he lamented the changes he had seen in his friend since taking on ministerial office. ""While I would be happy to be in the jungle or stuck in a lift with him, I would draw the line at being stranded in a planning room with him,"" he said.Date of birth: 21 December, 1948 (69) Most recent post: Secretary of state for exiting the EU, MP for Haltemprice and Howden since 1987Education: Tooting Bec grammar school, Warwick University (Bsc molecular science and computer science), London Business School, Harvard University management school Family: Married Doreen in 1973. Three childrenBefore politics: Senior executive at sugar giant Tate and LyleInitially seen as an ultra-Thatcherite, David Davis was elected to Parliament in 1987, at the age of 38, after a career in management with sugar giant Tate and Lyle. But Mr Davis did not fit the traditional mould of a Tory MP.Despite being a passionate opponent of socialism in all its forms, his political hero is the late Tony Benn, father of Hilary and hero of the radical, Corbynista left.He had a troubled background. ""I was a wild kid,"" he told an audience at the Royal Festival Hall in 2002, where he shared the stage with Mr Benn, something, he said, that would have made his Labour-voting parents very proud. The two bonded over their shared Euroscepticism - but little else - at that event.He got into Warwick University on an army scholarship and trained with the SAS as a reservist to help pay his way. His military background, and fearless attitude, endeared him to Tory grandees such as the late Alan Clark, another of his heroes, as he began his rise through the party ranks in the early 1990s. Over dinner hosted by Clark at his medieval Saltwood Castle, in Kent, Mr Davis agreed to walk along the crumbling ramparts overlooking the ruins of a chapel.""[He] did the 'black' route without turning a hair, then retraced his footsteps, hands in pockets - first time that's ever been done!"" Clark wrote in his diary.""He is an extraordinarily optimistic and self-confident person,"" Tory MP Andrew Mitchell - a long time friend and ally - told the BBC's Newsnight programme's Nick Watt last year.""I remember one of the Cameroons saying to me in exasperation that he was the only person he knows who did not go to Eton but has the same level of self-confidence you get from an Eton education.""Despite his Eurosceptic views, Mr Davis served as a government whip under pro-EU Prime Minister John Major in the early 1990s, attempting to get rebel Tory MPs to support the Maastricht Treaty, which paved the way for closer European integration.He later served as Mr Major's Europe minister, helping to negotiate some of the agreements with Brussels he has since been charged with unpicking.His ""hard man"" image, working-class background and staunch right-wing credentials made him the frontrunner to replace Michael Howard as Conservative leader in 2005 (he had made an unexpected, and unsuccessful tilt at the job in 2001).He lost out to David Cameron, who made him shadow home secretary, where he carved out a distinctive niche for himself as a defender of traditional British freedoms, even though the two men had little time for each other.In 2008, he dramatically resigned his Haltemprice and Howden seat, and his frontbench role, to fight a by-election in protest at Labour's plans for identity cards and 42-day detention without charge.He won easily but rejected a job in the coalition government in 2010 to continue his civil liberties crusade from the backbenches, often in conflict with then Home Secretary Theresa May.He was involved in legal action against the government over Mrs May's data-retention plans - dubbed the ""snoopers' charter"" by critics - when he got the call to join her cabinet.Mr Davis will celebrate his 70th birthday in December, just over three months before Britain officially leaves the EU at the end of March 2019.

2018-07-09,Brexiteer-in-chief,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709212819/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44737667,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBoris Johnson's resignation as foreign secretary over Theresa May's Brexit policy will delight some Conservatives and dismay others - but does not come as too great a shock.The former London mayor and prominent Leave campaigner has been at odds with Mrs May's vision for Brexit for some time and has not been shy of saying so in public, leading many to wonder why he has not been sacked before now. In May, he called Mrs May's proposals for a post-Brexit customs partnership ""crazy"".Last month, he told Conservative donors the prime minister needed to show ""more guts"" in talks with Brussels and suggested US President Donald Trump could do a better job.More recently, he warned of a ""bog roll"" Brexit - which, rather than the clean break from the EU that many Tories want to see, would instead represent a departure that was ""soft, yielding and infinitely long"".Then, on Sunday, he was quoted as condemning Mrs May's Brexit proposals - agreed by her cabinet at a day-long meeting at Chequers - in colourful and crude terms.He claimed defending the plans was like ""polishing a turd"" - but nevertheless appeared to fall into line with the rest of her ministerial team, as they united behind her, with friends saying he was staying in the cabinet to fight for the kind of Brexit he wanted.He did not comment publicly, however, in contrast to fellow Brexiteer Michael Gove, who mounted a defence of the PM on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, saying her plans were the best option for a clean exit from the EU.Mr Johnson's hand may have been forced by the resignation of Brexit secretary David Davis, who said Mrs May's plans were a ""compromise too far"".As the figurehead of the Leave campaign, his political fortunes are seen as being inextricably linked to the government's ability to deliver a Brexit which satisfies the 17.4 million people who voted to leave in the 2016 referendum.His frontline political career was widely assumed to be over when Theresa May surprised Westminster by appointing him as foreign secretary on taking office in July 2016.Known for his gaffes and love of the limelight, many wondered how he would cope with the diplomatic niceties of his new role.He was not directly involved in the negotiations over the UK's exit from the EU.Instead, he has spent most of his time banging the drum for Britain abroad and dealing with crises such as Syria and Russia.However, he has still been a thorn in Mrs May's side.He has regularly popped up to issue warnings in Brexit-supporting newspapers about the risk of backsliding on key issues, such as the role of the European Court of Justice, the length of any transition period and the freedom to diverge from EU regulations and standards.In the run-up to Mrs May's key Florence speech last October, he seemed to set out his own ""red lines"" for the negotiations, prompting the first of many calls from pro-European Tories for him to be dismissed.As keeper of the Brexit flame, he has exploited the licence that cabinet divisions and uncertainty over UK policy have given him and others to speak out.He has been a frequent critic of the Treasury, claiming its fears about short-term economic disruption are blinding officials to the longer-term opportunities.And he has vigorously stuck by the idea of a Brexit dividend for the UK, repeating the controversial and disputed referendum claim there could be £350m a week in extra cash for the NHS.The prime minister has resisted calls from the opposition and some on her own side to sack Mr Johnson over his increasingly off-message comments.Her critics said this shows her weakness, as the leader of a deeply divided government without a Commons majority.  It may have reflected a nervousness about what Mr Johnson, who remains popular with many party members, might do on the backbenches.The 54-year Eton and Oxford-educated former political journalist has harboured ambitions of getting the top job for many years, but was beaten to No 10 by his contemporary David Cameron.When the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip - who was born in New York and until recently held dual US-UK citizenship - finally got his chance to succeed his friend and rival in the summer of 2016, the prize was snatched away from him in the most dramatic fashion.His campaign manager and fellow Leave supporter Michael Gove abandoned him at the eleventh-hour during the leadership contest, questioning his suitability for the job, and put himself forward instead.Mr Johnson duly withdrew from the leadership race, a move which angered some of his supporters who questioned whether he had the stomach for the fight.His critics say his ambition trumps his principles, most recently when he flew to Afghanistan rather than take part in a vote on the expansion of Heathrow airport, which he has vehemently opposed for many years. The question now is whether his resignation is a prelude to another leadership bid."
2018-07-09,Trump's UK visit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709212819/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44739152,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDonald Trump's trip to the UK will be the 12th by a US president. But this working, not state, visit is expected to be different to those that have gone before.In 1977 Jimmy Carter came to Britain on his first overseas trip as president. His main aim was to attend the G7 summit in London, but he also chose to visit Newcastle.The city had taken part in a scheme designed to build bridges between the United States and the rest of the world. So the newly elected leader of the free world decided to conduct his first act of global diplomacy from a podium outside the concrete splendour of Newcastle Civic Centre. He was given the freedom of the city by the mayor. And when the peanut farmer from Georgia stepped up to the microphone, he greeted an adoring crowd of 20,000 people thus: ""Howay the lads! I am grateful to be a Geordie now.""The local newspaper, the Chronicle, reported: ""They packed the airport. They packed the streets. They packed the area outside the Civic Centre and they opened their arms to him. And he loved it. A great smile spread across his face... as he was greeted by crowds waving both the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes.""This was how it used to be: British crowds cheering US presidents.  When JFK came in 1961, half a million people lined the route between London airport and the west end to catch a glimpse of him and his wife Jackie. The scale of the public adulation was in part due to the fact that US presidents enjoyed great popularity in Britain: they were political show business and our closest allies in recent wars. They also came to the UK more rarely. The first president to visit was Woodrow Wilson in 1918 during the post-World War One peace talks. But it was not for another 27 years - and after another world war - that a second US president came to our shores, in 1945. And all Harry S Truman did was visit King George VI on a naval cruiser anchored in Plymouth harbour. Dwight D Eisenhower did not come until 1959. So, only three presidential visits in 40 years. Lyndon Johnson never came, nor did Gerald Ford.US presidents also enjoyed a warm relationship with the Royal Family. Eisenhower was a particular favourite of the Queen, who invited him to stay at Balmoral - the only president to do so. Like Donald Trump, ""Ike"" also owned property in Scotland: not a golf course but an apartment at Culzean Castle on the Ayrshire coast which had been given to him by the owners, in recognition of his role as supreme allied commander during World War Two.Ronald Reagan also got on well with the Queen, who in 1982 personally invited him to stay at Windsor Castle and go for a ride in the Great Park. In 1994, Bill and Hillary Clinton were honoured with a sleepover on board the royal yacht Britannia in Portsmouth. In 2003 George Bush spent the night at Buckingham Palace - the first president to do so since Wilson in 1918. In contrast, Donald Trump is expected to get a cup of tea when he passes through Windsor on Friday.Nor may President Trump receive quite the same political welcome as his predecessors. He will not attend cabinet as Bill Clinton did in 1997 shortly after Tony Blair was first elected prime minister. He will not get to flip burgers in the Downing Street garden or address both houses of parliament, as President Obama did in 2011. Instead, he will make do with a short visit to the prime minister's country residence, Chequers, like Richard Nixon in 1970. This will be very much a working visit.  A full state visit may have been offered but there is no date in the diary for when it may happen.Of course, presidential visits do not always go smoothly. There was a private diplomatic row in 1982 when the White House delayed replying to the Queen's invitation to Ronald Reagan to stay at Windsor because his wife's astrologer was worried about overseas travel. In 1997 I watched as Bill Clinton's long motorcade was divided in two when London's Tower Bridge was opened to allow through a Thames sailing barge - much to the consternation of the security men. And in 1977, after a banquet at Buckingham Palace, President Carter decided to bid farewell to the Queen Mother by kissing her full on the lips, something that apparently had not happened since King George VI died in 1952. ""I took a sharp step backwards,"" she recalled later. ""Not quite far enough.""So huge efforts will be made to ensure that President Trump's trip goes smoothly. Many demonstrations have been planned, but the huge security operation surrounding his progress from London to Chequers to Windsor to Scotland - largely by air - means that he may not get too close to the protests. Much harder to cover up will be the fundamental policy differences between the US and British governments. Since Donald Trump took office, Theresa May has publicly disagreed with him over his decision to impose trade tariffs, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, move the US embassy to Jerusalem, order a Muslim travel ban and retweet anti-Muslim messages from a British far-right group. British ministers and officials will do their best to welcome Mr Trump but even they are now talking about the need to respect the office of the presidency rather than the current incumbent as an individual. So the president's trip this week will test a relationship that has recently become much harder to keep special."
2018-07-09,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709212819/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-09,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180709212819/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

He also praised Mr Johnson, describing him as a ""good friend of mine"". Mrs May says the proposed new relationship with the EU will ""honour the result of the referendum"" and allow the UK to ""take back control of our borders, our law and our money"".Speaking at a press conference alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the prime minister said her plan would allow for a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"", protecting jobs and livelihoods.It would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, in an attempt to minimise friction for trade at borders.But some Tories are unhappy, saying it will leave the UK tied closely to EU rules and prevent it from striking its own trade deals in years to come. More details are expected on Thursday in a White Paper.Ms Caulfield, who was vice chairwoman for women, supported Leave in the EU referendum. Mr Bradley - who backed Remain - had a brief trying to appeal to young voters. The Conservatives have nine vice chairmen in total, appointed in January's reshuffle.In her resignation letter to Mrs May, Ms Caulfield - the MP for Lewes in Sussex - said the proposed new trading relationship with the EU did not ""fully embrace the opportunities that Brexit can provide"".Mr Bradley, who posted a positive message of support for Mrs May before Friday's Chequers meeting, said he could not now ""with any sincerity defend this course"" to voters in his Leave-backing constituency of Mansfield.Whilst everyone gets very excited about Chequers tomorrow, truth is PM has been consistent with her #Brexit wishlist from day one - control of money, borders and laws. We should support her, get behind her and deliver precisely those things!End of Twitter post  by @bbradleympHe criticised the decision to adopt a ""backstop"" position on customs to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland, saying it was becoming ""the barrier to the kind of wide-ranging free trade agreement with the EU that many in our party and the country would like to see"".Amid continuing unrest on the Tory benches, Andrew Bridgen became the first Conservative MP to publicly confirm he had sent a letter calling for a vote of confidence in Mrs May.Under Conservative Party rules, it requires 15% of all Tory MPs - currently 48 - to write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee to trigger a vote of confidence in the leader.

The US President has previously expressed sympathy for Brexit and said he wanted to do a quick trade deal with the UK once it leaves the EU - which is due to take place on 29 March, 2019.Asked about his forthcoming visit, Mr Trump referred to the turbulence of the past 48 hours, which has prompted speculation about Theresa May's future as leader. ""It is going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato,"" he told reporters on the lawn of the White House. ""We will work it out and all countries will be happy.""So I have Nato, I have the UK - that's a situation with turmoil.""Mr Trump, who has called on other Nato members to pay more for their own defence, joked that his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday ""may be the easiest of all"". Asked about Mrs May's future, he said it was a matter for the British people. ""I get along with her very well. I have a very good relationship. That's certainly up to the people, not up to me.""As for Boris Johnson - seen by many as a potential future challenger to Mrs May - Mr Trump said he was a ""friend of mine"" and he hoped he might find time to speak to him during his visit.""He's been very, very nice to me, very supportive. I like Boris Johnson, I've always liked him.""The ex-foreign secretary, who warned in his resignation letter on Monday that the ""Brexit dream was dying"", has spoken of his ""increasing admiration"" for Mr Trump and speculated about what Brexit negotiations would be like if he was in charge. During his visit, Mr Trump will hold talks with Theresa May, who will also host a dinner for him at Blenheim Palace. He is also due to have tea with The Queen at Windsor Castle.Protests are expected against Mr Trump, whose policies - including a travel ban on a number of predominantly Muslim countries, the detention of child migrants on the US-Mexico border and the imposition of tariffs on EU steel and aluminium exports - have all been criticised by the UK. Mrs May has insisted the UK's strategic and historic links with the US mean hosting its US president is essential, although making clear where the UK disagrees with him.After being appointed foreign secretary on Monday, Jeremy Hunt said the UK would be a ""dependable ally, a country that stands up for the values that matter to the people of this country and will be a strong and confident voice in the world"".Mr Hunt urged all ministers to stand behind the prime minister in pursuit of an agreement with the EU based on the approach agreed at Chequers. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who has insisted any Brexit deal must guarantee there is no ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland, has suggested the Chequers agreement might represent a breakthrough.""If the UK is able to relax some of its red lines, then the European Union should be flexible too,"" he told the Irish Parliament. ""I think perhaps we are now entering into that space.""The Nato summit in Brussels will be held against a backdrop of unprecedented recent tensions between Europe and the United States over trade and defence.Mr Trump has said the US is spending a disproportionate amount to ""protect"" Europe, amid reports that he might be considering reducing US troop numbers on the continent. The US President took to Twitter to berate European members of the transatlantic alliance, only a handful of which spend 2% of their GDP on defence in line with Nato targets.  Getting ready to leave for Europe. First meeting - NATO. The U.S. is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them. Not fair to the U.S. taxpayer. On top of that we lose $151 Billion on Trade with the European Union. Charge us big Tariffs (& Barriers)!End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpBut Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, hit back, saying the EU spent more on defence than either Russia or China.Dear @realDonaldTrump.

2018-07-10,UK to send 440 more troops to Afghanistan,https://web.archive.org//web/20180711061501/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44787636,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK is to send 440 more non-combat troops to Afghanistan, the prime minister will announce at the Brussels Nato summit.The commitment to Nato's mission in Afghanistan will take the total number of UK troops in the country to 1,090.Around half of the troops will deploy from the Welsh Guards in August and the remainder will follow by February 2019.They will help ""bring the stability and security that the Afghan people deserve,"" Theresa May said.At the height of the war, Nato had  more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone. As of last month, the number of Nato personnel stood at 16,000 from 39 countries, operating mainly from Kabul and focusing on training and assisting the army and police.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson - who wrote to Mrs May recommending more troops - said ""whenever the call comes, the UK is always one of the first to step up and support our friends and allies across the globe"".Nato asked Britain to deploy more troops a year ago. In September of last year, the US committed an extra 3,000 troops to support Afghan forces.Ahead of the summit, which begins on Wednesday, US president Donald Trump, hit out at his Nato allies for failing to spend enough on defence. ""The US is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them,"" Mr Trump tweeted.Analysis by BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale Sending another 440 British troops will make the UK the third biggest contributor to the Nato train, advise, and assist mission in Afghanistan.The extra troops will arrive later this summer and will reinforce the UK-led Kabul Security Force. It is not a return to a combat role. Its primary role is to transport international advisers safely around the capital - what British soldiers have dubbed ""Armoured Uber"".The US leader's main objection is that a number of member states have not increased their defence budgets to the target of 2% of economic output.But Mrs May said she expects ""to agree an ambitious package of measures to strengthen our deterrence and defence"" at the summit. ""And we will continue to make the case for all allies to follow the UK's example and meet the 2% pledge,"" she added.The last UK combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014 after being involved in the conflict since 2001.The additional troops will add to Britain's existing contribution to the UK-led Kabul Security Force and mentor the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces in the country's capital. ""Lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan will help keep the streets of Britain safe and this uplift signals our unwavering commitment to realising that future,"" Mr Williamson said."
2018-07-10,Facebook faces maximum fine for data misuse,https://web.archive.org//web/20180711061501/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44785151,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK's data protection watchdog intends to fine Facebook £500,000 for data breaches - the maximum allowed.The Information Commissioner's Office said Facebook had failed to ensure another company - Cambridge Analytica - had deleted users' data.The ICO will also bring a criminal action against Cambridge Analytica's defunct parent company SCL Elections. And it has raised concerns about political parties buying personal information from ""data brokers"".Facebook said it would respond to the report ""soon"".The ICO also said another company - Aggregate IQ - which worked with the Vote Leave campaign in the run up to the EU Referendum - must stop processing UK citizens' data.The action comes 16 months after the ICO began its probe into political campaigners' use of personal data following concerns raised by whistleblower Christopher Wylie, among others.Mr Wylie, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica - a London-based political consulting firm - said his company had made unauthorised use of personal data harvested from millions of Facebook users.  The ICO found that Facebook had breached its own rules and failed to make sure that Cambridge Analytica had deleted this personal data.While Cambridge Analytica insisted it had indeed wiped the data after Facebook's erasure request in December 2015, the ICO said it had seen evidence that copies of the data had been shared with others.""This potentially brings into question the accuracy of the deletion certificates provided to Facebook,"" said an ICO spokesperson.Responding to the ICO report, Mr Wylie said: ""Months ago, I reported Facebook and Cambridge Analytica to the UK authorities.  ""Based on that evidence, Facebook is today being issued with the maximum fine allowed under British law. ""Cambridge Analytica, including possibly its directors, will be criminally prosecuted.""The ICO has also written to the UK's 11 main political parties compelling them to have their data protection practices audited.It is concerned the parties may have bought lifestyle information about members of the public from data brokers, who might have not have obtained the necessary consent.In particular, the ICO raised concern about one data broker: Emma's Diary. The firm offers medical advice to pregnant women and gift packs after babies are born.The ICO said it was concerned about how transparent the firm had been about its political activities.It said that the Labour Party had confirmed using the firm, but did not provide other details at this point beyond saying it intended to take some form of regulatory action.The service's owner Lifecycle Marketing could not be reached for comment. But it has told the Guardian that it does not agree with the ICO's findings.Looking wider, the ICO noted that Facebook had been the biggest recipient of digital advertising by political parties and campaigns to date. Yet, it said, the US firm had neither done enough to explain to its members how they were being targeted as a consequence, nor given them enough control over how their sensitive personal data was used.As a result, it said, Facebook was guilty of two breaches of the Data Protection Act.The tech firm's chief privacy officer has issued a brief response.""As we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015,"" said Erin Egan.""We have been working closely with the ICO in their investigation of Cambridge Analytica, just as we have with authorities in the US and other countries. We're reviewing the report and will respond to the ICO soon.""Cambridge Analytica and its parent SCL Elections began insolvency proceedings in May.But the ICO said it was still taking legal steps to bring a criminal prosecution against the business.The basis for this would be that SCL Elections had failed to properly respond to an earlier demand that it give a US academic a copy of any personal information it held on him along with an explanation as to its source and usage.Prof David Carroll first asked for the data in January 2017, and the ICO served a related enforcement order four months later.Bearing in mind SCL Elections is now out of business, the ICO said it might consider taking action against the company's directors.""A successful prosecution may result in a conviction and an unlimited fine,"" added a spokeswoman.The ICO said it had established that the Canadian data analytics firm AggregateIQ - AIQ - had access to UK voters' personal data provided by the Brexit referendum's Vote Leave campaign.It said it was now investigating whether this information had been transferred and accessed outside the UK and whether this amounted to a breach of the data protection act.The watchdog added that it continued to investigate to what degree AIQ and SCL Elections had shared UK personal data.And it said it had served an enforcement notice forbidding AIQ from continuing to make use of a list of UK citizens' email addresses and names that it still holds.Other action includes:The ICO said it expects the next stage of its investigation to be complete by the end of October."

Following the meeting, Board of Deputies President Jonathan Arkush said: ""Naz Shah is one of the only people involved in Labour's anti-Semitism crisis who has sought to make amends for her actions, and for this we commend her and now regard Naz as a sincere friend of our community.""She nearly doubled her majority at the 2017 general election. She recently hit the headlines after she was forced to take part in a key Brexit vote in a wheelchair after being discharged from hospital. She hit out at the ""undignified"" way she had been treated by Conservative whips. "

I not only feel proud to have known him, I feel immensely privileged.""Mrs May added: ""There can be few people who have served our country for as long, and with such dedication, as Lord Carrington did - from his gallantry as a tank commander in the Second World War, for which he was awarded the Military Cross, to his service in government under two monarchs and six prime ministers, dating back to Winston Churchill.""Former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine said his late colleague and friend was a ""great patriot"" who represented the ""essence of One Nation Conservatism"".""Frankly, he is one of the greats,"" he told the BBC. He paid tribute to his integrity in taking personal responsibility for the failure to anticipate the Falklands invasion. ""Peter Carrington carried the can and resigned. I think history will show it was not quite as simple as that. But this was a man who know what he believed to be right.""Members of the House of Lords - where he spent over 70 years - paid their own tributes as the day's sitting got under way.Lords Leader Baroness Evans said he his contribution to public life was ""unsurpassed in modern times"", and Labour's Baroness Smith said he had a ""truly remarkable life and career"".Crossbencher Lord Luce recalled his decision to resign over the Falklands invasion, adding that ""his only concern was to put his country before himself""."
2018-07-10,PM's new cabinet meets amid Brexit turmoil,https://web.archive.org//web/20180711061501/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44775197,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May's new-look cabinet has met for the first time after a string of resignations over her Brexit strategy left her government in crisis.Mrs May was forced to carry out a reshuffle of her top team after Boris Johnson and David Davis both quit.The prime minister has warned the Tory party it must unite or face the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn in power.Jeremy Hunt, who has replaced Mr Johnson as foreign secretary, said he would be ""four square"" behind her.After the cabinet meeting, Mrs May tweeted that she was ""looking ahead to a busy week"".US President Donald Trump, who arrives in the country for a visit on Thursday, said the UK was in ""turmoil"" and ""it is up to the people"" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister.The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU after that.The delay has been partly blamed on deep disagreements within the Conservative Party over what shape Brexit should take.Essentially the arguments are about how much the UK should prioritise business interests by compromising on post-referendum promises to end free movement of people, remove the UK from the remit of the European Court of Justice, and also have an independent trade policy which allows the UK to set its own trade rules and strike its own trade deals.Last Friday at the prime minister's country retreat at Chequers Mrs May brokered a ""collective"" agreement on proposals for the future relationship between the EU and UK.However, Mr Johnson - whose departure on Monday followed that of Brexit Secretary David Davis and several junior figures - accused Mrs May of pursuing a ""semi-Brexit"".In his resignation letter, he said the Brexit ""dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt"".Mr Davis, who has been leading Brexit negotiations for the UK so far, said he did not agree with the prime minister's proposals, so was the wrong person to be going into negotiations with them.He said that the UK was ""giving away too much, too easily"" ahead of negotiations with the European Union.Several junior government figures also quit, including Brexit minister Steve Baker who told the BBC's Daily Politics they had been ""blindsided"" by the No 10 plan that emerged at Chequers.Asked on Tuesday morning whether he too had considered resigning, another prominent Brexiteer, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, replied ""absolutely not"" and declared himself ""100%"" behind Mrs May's Brexit plan.On Monday evening, the prime minister faced down backbench critics at a meeting of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, amid rumours they were close to getting the 48 signatures needed to trigger a no-confidence vote that could spark a leadership election.She told her critics the alternative to the party coming together could be a left-wing Labour administration, with Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister.The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said that while Brexiteers were still unhappy with the Chequers plan, their focus was on getting that changed, not on ousting Mrs May. ""There is a genuine weariness and horror at the thought of more disruption, turmoil and a possible leadership contest,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Above all, I just don't think one should underestimate Mrs May's sheer durability - you look around her cabinet table and there are bodies littered all over the place… and she is still there. ""Yes, her position is extraordinarily fragile and vulnerable, but it is far from game over.""Former Conservative leader Lord Howard called for a ""degree of humility all around"".He told the Today programme: ""I do think it would be extremely foolish and extremely ill-advised for anyone to send in letters to mount a motion of no confidence in the prime minister and I am delighted that good sense seems to be breaking out.""The UK's negotiations with the EU will now be fronted by Dominic Raab, a staunch Leave supporter who has been promoted from the job of housing minister.Mr Hunt, who has been health secretary for the past six years, was a Remain campaigner in the 2016 EU referendum. He has since said he is a convert to the Brexit cause.But his appointment means the four great offices of state - prime minister, chancellor, foreign secretary, and home secretary - are all held by ministers who voted to stay in the EU.In his first comments as foreign secretary, Mr Hunt said he would be standing ""four square"" behind the prime minister ""so that we can get through an agreement with the European Union based on what was agreed by the cabinet last week at Chequers"".Matt Hancock is the new health secretary, with Attorney General Jeremy Wright replacing him as the culture secretary, and backbencher Geoffrey Cox becoming the new attorney general.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson and Mr Davis had abandoned a ""sinking ship"", shattering the ""illusion of unity"" initially surrounding the Chequers plan.The UK and the EU have been negotiating Brexit terms for more than a year now and have been hoping to agree broad aims for their future relationship in October.The aim of the Chequers away day had been to agree the UK position - after two years of discussion - but the resignations have put a question mark over that.The uncertainty in the UK comes before the plan is officially put to the EU, who may well be unhappy with aspects of it they have previously referred to as ""cherry picking"".One other element of Friday's agreement worth noting is that it pledged to speed up preparations for the UK to be ready to leave the EU without a Brexit deal in March next year.Labour MP and Remainer Chuka Umunna told Today that all the drama of Monday needed to be put to one side, saying: ""This has gone from a soap opera to a comedy, and it would be funny were it not for the fact that the subject matter is going to have a fundamental impact on hundreds of thousands of people's jobs."""

Mr Johnson's parliamentary private secretary Conor Burn has also stepped down. Brexit minister Steve Baker also left the government.Housing minister Dominic Raab has replaced Mr Davis as Brexit secretary.Mr Johnson does not pull any punches, saying Brexit ""should be about opportunity and hope"" and a ""chance to do things differently"", but ""that dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt"".He claims crucial decisions have been postponed, including preparations for a ""no-deal"" scenario, ""with the result that we appear to be heading for a semi-Brexit, with large parts of the economy still locked in the EU system, but with no UK control over that system"". In her letter accepting his resignation, the prime minister said she had allowed cabinet ministers ""considerable latitude to express their individual views"" on Brexit.""But the agreement we reached on Friday marks the point where that is no longer the case and if you are not able to provide the support we need to secure this deal in the interests of the United Kingdom, it is right that you should step down.""The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards.There have been differences within the Conservatives over how far the UK should prioritise the economy by compromising on issues such as leaving the remit of the European Court of Justice and ending free movement of people.Mrs May only has a majority in Parliament with the support of the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, so any split raises questions about whether her plan could survive a Commons vote. She took her entire cabinet to her country residence on Friday to try to get agreement on a UK vision for post-Brexit relations. An agreement was announced after the 12-hour meeting, but many Brexiteers have been unhappy with the deal which they think will lead to the ""worst of both worlds"". The man leading the UK's negotiating team, David Davis, resigned late on Sunday night, saying that he did not agree with the UK's proposals, so was the wrong person to be going into negotiations with them.He told the BBC that he thought the UK was giving away ""too much, too easily"" and predicted that the EU would be demanding more concessions in talks.Mr Davis, who had been Brexit secretary since Mrs May became prime minister in 2016, said he had made compromises since taking on the role, but this was ""one compromise too far"".Speaking in a boisterous House of Commons, Mrs May defended the Brexit plan agreed on Friday, which would see the UK agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU for trading in goods, but not services, after Brexit.She paid tribute to Mr Johnson's ""passion"" in championing a global Britain after Brexit and Mr Davis' work in steering through key Brexit legislation. But she told MPs: ""We do not agree on the best way to deliver our shared commitments to honour the result of the referendum."" Mrs May told MPs that the plan agreed by the cabinet at Chequers was the basis of a ""responsible and credible"" offer to restart renegotiations with the EU.But she warned that if the EU did not engage with her plan, there was a ""serious risk"" of the UK leaving in March 2019 without a deal in a ""disorderly"" manner. Under her proposal, a treaty would be signed committing the UK to ""continued harmonisation"" with EU rules - avoiding friction at the UK-EU border, including Northern Ireland.But Parliament would oversee the UK's trade policy and have the ability to ""choose"" to diverge from the EU rules. Freedom of movement would come to an end but a ""mobility framework"" would ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to study and work in each other's territories.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Johnson and Mr Davis had abandoned a ""sinking ship"", shattering the ""illusion of unity"" initially surrounding the Chequers plan.There was a crisis in government, he said, adding: ""It is clear this government cannot secure a good deal for Britain."" Mrs May came under pressure from prominent Tory Brexiteers on the backbenches, with ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith urging her to rule out further concessions during the talks.The European Commission declined to comment on the resignations but Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said he hoped a change in faces might lead to a change in policy. Politicians come and go but the problems they have created for people remain. I can only regret that the idea of #Brexit has not left with Davis and Johnson.

2018-07-10,Johnson resignation letter and May reply,https://web.archive.org//web/20180711061501/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44772804,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDear TheresaIt is more than two years since the British people voted to leave the European Union on an unambiguous and categorical promise that if they did so they would be taking back control of their democracy.They were told that they would be able to manage their own immigration policy, repatriate the sums of UK cash currently spent by the EU, and, above all, that they would be able to pass laws independently and in the interests of the people of this  country.Brexit should be about opportunity and hope. It should be a chance to do things differently, to be more nimble and dynamic, and to maximise the particular advantages of the UK as an open, outward-looking global economy.That dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt.We have postponed crucial decisions - including the preparations for no deal, as I argued in my letter to you of last November - with the result that we appear to be heading for a semi-Brexit, with large parts of the economy still locked in the EU system, but with no UK control over that system.It now seems that the opening bid of our negotiations involves accepting that we are not actually going to be able to make our own laws. Indeed we seem to have gone backwards since the last Chequers meeting in February, when I described my frustrations, as Mayor of London, in trying to protect cyclists from juggernauts. We had wanted to lower the cabin windows to improve visibility; and even though such designs were already on the market, and even though there had been a horriﬁc spate of deaths, mainly of female cyclists, we were told that we had to wait for the EU to legislate on the matter.So at the previous Chequers session we thrashed out an elaborate procedure for divergence from EU rules. But even that now seems to have been taken off the table, and there is in fact no easy UK right of initiative. Yet if Brexit is to mean anything, it must surely give ministers and Parliament the chance to do things differently to protect the public. If a country cannot pass a law to save the lives of female cyclists - when that proposal is supported at every level of UK government - then I don't see how that country can truly be called independent.Conversely, the British government has spent decades arguing against this or that EU directive, on the grounds that it was too burdensome or ill-thought out. We are  now in the ludicrous position of asserting that we must accept huge amounts of precisely such EU law, without changing an iota, because it is essential for our economic health - and when we no longer have any ability to inﬂuence these laws as they are made.In that respect we are truly headed for the status of colony - and many will struggle to see the economic or political advantages of that particular arrangement.It is also clear that by surrendering control over our rulebook for goods and agrifoods (and much else besides) we will make it much more difﬁcult to do free trade deals.  And then there is the further impediment of having to argue for an impractical and undeliverable customs arrangement unlike any other in existence.What is even more disturbing is that this is our opening bid. This is already how we see the end state for the UK -  before the other side has made its counter-offer. It is as though we are sending our vanguard into battle with the white ﬂags ﬂuttering above them. Indeed, I was concerned, looking at Friday's document, that there might be further concessions on immigration, or that we might end up effectively paying for access to the single market.On Friday I acknowledged that my side of the argument were too few to prevail, and congratulated you on at least reaching a cabinet decision on the way forward. As I said then, the government now has a song to sing. The trouble is that I have practised the words over the weekend and find that they stick in the throat. We must have collective responsibility. Since I cannot in all conscience champion these proposals, I have sadly concluded that I must go.I am proud to have served as Foreign Secretary in your government. As I step down, I would like ﬁrst to thank the patient ofﬁcers of the Metropolitan Police who have looked after me and my family, at times in demanding circumstances. I am proud too of the extraordinary men and women of our diplomatic service. Over the last few months they have shown how many friends this country has around the  world, as 28 governments expelled Russian spies in an unprecedented protest at the attempted assassination of the Skripals. They have organised a highly successful Commonwealth summit and secured record international support for this government's campaign for 12 years of quality education for every girl, and much more besides. As I leave ofﬁce, the FCO now has the largest and by far the most  effective diplomatic network of any country in Europe — a continent which we will never leave.The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP Dear Boris,Thank you for your letter relinquishing the ofﬁce of Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.I am sorry - and a little surprised - to receive it after the productive discussions we had at Chequers on Friday, and the comprehensive and detailed proposal which we agreed as a Cabinet. It is a proposal which will honour the result of the referendum and the commitments we made in our general election manifesto to leave the single market and the customs union. It will mean that we take back control of our borders, our laws, and our money - ending the freedom of movement, ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the United Kingdom, and ending the days of sending vast sums of taxpayers' money to the European Union. We will be able to spend that money on our priorities instead - such as the £20 billion increase we have announced for the NHS budget, which means that we will soon be spending an extra £394 million a week on our National Health Service.As I outlined at Chequers, the agreement we reached requires the full, collective support of Her Majesty's Government. During the EU referendum campaign, collective responsibility on EU policy was temporarily suspended. As we developed our policy on Brexit, I have allowed Cabinet colleagues considerable latitude to express their individual views. But the agreement we reached on Friday marks the point where that is no longer the case, and if you are not able to provide the support we need to secure this deal in the interests of the United Kingdom, it is right that you should step down.As you do so, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the service you have given to our country, and to the Conservative Party, as Mayor of London and as Foreign Secretary - not least for the passion that you have demonstrated in promoting a Global Britain to the world as we leave the European Union.Yours ever,Theresa May"

His appointment follows the promotion of staunch Leave supporter Dominic Raab to the cabinet as Brexit secretary - but the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said most of the top jobs in government were now held by ministers who had backed Remain.There are potentially dozens of Tory rebels who want to halt Mrs May's Chequers compromise but it is not clear how committed they are, added our correspondent, and Monday's resignations might have left her with a more pliable and supportive cabinet.  Her future now depends on how Brussels reacts to her Brexit proposals - and what Mr Davis and Mr Johnson plan to do next, she added.Both men had signed up on Friday to Mrs May's blueprint for Brexit - but 48 hours later, first Mr Davis and then Mr Johnson said they could not commit themselves to promoting the plans as they did not believe in them.Brexit minister Steve Baker and two ministerial aides also resigned.After his appointment as Health and Social Care Secretary was announced by Downing Street, Mr Hancock said: ""Really looking forward to joining @DHSCgovuk at such an important time for our great NHS.

Is the prime minister's plan really leaving the EU? ""I don't think so,"" he said.That is the sentiment that's widely shared among the Tory party, and perhaps among many voters too. And guess what? It doesn't always matter which side of the referendum they were on either.Some former Remainers say ""look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do this, then for goodness sake let's do it properly or just stay in"".From some Leavers, like Mr Davis, you also get ""look, this is a dodgy compromise, what's the point? If we are going to do it, then for goodness sake let's do it properly"".Mrs May's Conservative Party only has a majority in Parliament with the support in key votes of the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, so any split raises questions about whether her plan could survive a Commons vote - and has also led to renewed questions about whether she will face a challenge to her position.Mr Raab has served in government since after the 2015 election, initially working in the Ministry of Justice before moving to the communities department in January.The European Commission has declined to comment on the change of personnel, saying it would continue to negotiate with ""goodwill"" to try and secure an agreement on the terms of the UK's exit and future relations.Asked how much of a problem Mr Davis's resignation was for the future of the negotiations, a spokesman replied: ""It is not for us, we are here to work."" Mr Davis said he could not remain in his post because he no longer believed in the plan for the UK's future relations with the EU which was backed by the cabinet on Friday.He said he hoped his resignation would make it easier for the UK to resist EU attempts to extract further concessions - but he insisted he was not seeking to undermine or challenge the prime minister. In an interview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Davis said Mr Raab would be ""very effective"" in the post. Reflecting on his resignation, he said he had lived with compromises in Brexit policy for two years but there came a point where these went ""too far"".""I worry about the fine detail and that it will not work out as we hope,"" he said. Asked what he would say to colleagues who thought it was time to remove Theresa May, he replied it was ""not a good idea"" - insisting that she was a ""good prime minister"". Junior Brexit minister Steve Baker, who also resigned overnight, launched an attack on government policy. He told the BBC's Daily Politics that he had been ""blindsided"" by the Brexit proposal agreed at Chequers.Mr Baker also said that he and his team had been preparing a white paper ""which did not accord with what has been put to the cabinet at Chequers"".The mood at Westminster, by Iain WatsonThe atmosphere is volatile. The long-standing Leave supporters of the European Research Group of Tory MPs will have two meetings today - either side of the PM's address to her own MPs - to discuss next steps.Views differ on whether the government's position is simply impractical - ""the worst of both worlds"" - or whether it actually breaches a manifesto commitment by offering a customs union in all but name.But there is agreement amongst many Brexiteers that the policy should change, and quickly. It is less clear how they will bring that about. If there is not a direct triggering of a leadership contest, what are the options?One is that Brexiteers go ""on strike"" and refuse to back government policy in parliament, weakening her premiership unless she changes course.Another is that backbench Brexiteers put more pressure on like-minded cabinet colleagues to follow David Davis out the door.Speaking to the BBC last week, Mr Raab said the process of negotiating Brexit was ""rocky"" but what mattered was getting there in the end, which would require ""flexibility and pragmatism"". He told the Political Thinking podcast that he was ""relaxed"" about the UK leaving without a deal and it was ""not something I would fear"". Conservative MPs welcomed the appointment of Mr Raab, who has a black belt in karate, one describing him as a ""highly capable"" figure with a clear attention to detail. But Labour said a new man fronting the negotiations ""changed nothing"". ""The deep division at the heart of the Conservative Party has broken out in public and plunged this government into crisis,"" said shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer. ""It is now clearer than ever that Theresa May does not have the authority to negotiate for Britain or deliver a Brexit deal that protects jobs and the economy.""Asked whether Mr Raab would be in charge of the talks, No 10 said Mrs May had ""always been, from the outset, the lead negotiator"". But a spokesman said there was a ""huge body of work to be done, in terms of preparations for the UK leaving the EU and that obviously includes no-deal preparations as well"". Mrs May will address Parliament later on the plan agreed at Chequers on Friday as well as address Tory MPs as she seeks to keep her Brexit strategy on track.Ahead of Monday's statement, opposition MPs and peers - as well as Tory MPs - are being offered briefings by Downing Street on the detail of the Chequers statement. A spokesman for the European Research Group of eurosceptic Tory MPs told the BBC that involving opposition MPs had caused considerable anger and was the government's ""stupidest mistake"". And Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the group, likened a PM relying on opposition MPs to the children's story in which the gingerbread man accepts the offer of a ride across a river from a fox, only to get eaten by it."

""It smashes the hard-won Brexit compromise plan to pieces,"" writes London correspondent Florentin Collomp. ""The knives are out in the alleys of Westminster, where the summer promises to be hot"" for the prime minister, he warns. Philippe Bernard of the centre-left Le Monde is not so sure whether Mr Johnson's resignation means ""the beginning of the end for Theresa May... or the beginning of the end of her worries"".He says that after two years of ""futile skirmishes on Brexit, the boil has finally been lanced"" by Mrs May's shift towards keeping close ties with the EU. German commentators can't help drawing World Cup parallels, none more blatant that centre-left Spiegel Online's comparison of the prime minister to England manager Gareth Southgate.""They both want to win game after game, but the difference is that while Southgate has yet to get through the semi-finals, May's final game has already begun,"" writes correspondent Joerg Schindler.He expects hardline Tory Brexiteer MPs to see Boris Johnson's resignation as a ""signal to revolt"" against the prime minister's leadership.""It will be no consolation if Britain wins another penalty shoot-out, as EU statutes do not provide for extra time over Brexit,"" Spiegel concludes.  In Berlin's liberal Der Tagesspiegel, Albrecht Meier also predicts a ""revolt in Westminster"" after Boris Johnson's resignation, adding that ""the prime minister must fear for her job"".As for the EU negotiators in Brussels, they have ""no choice but to wait for the outcome of the political drama in London. There will not be much time left for the negotiations in Brussels... as both sides are still far from the final goal,"" he writes. Dominic Johnson, the foreign editor of the left-wing Tageszeitung, says the breach between Mrs May and the two departing ministers is ""not just about Brexit, but also about loyalty, cabinet discipline, and work ethic"". He dubs Boris Johnson a ""scatterbrain ever since he took office two years ago, while David Davis has had only four hours of talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier this year, and has played no active role since March"". Spanish papers focus on the probable delays to the talks in Brussels, Barcelona's La Vanguardia sees Mrs May ""walking a tightrope"" in the ""worst crisis of her government"". ""Brussels is still waiting for the umpteenth British proposal, while time and patience are running out,"" it warns. The EU correspondent of centre-right El Mundo says Boris Johnson's departure is no great loss to diplomacy. ""A chatterbox with exaggerated ambitions that drove nearly the world mad,"" writes Pablo R. Suanzes, who notes that the foreign secretary chose to quit ""in the week when a British citizen died of nerve-agent poisoning, and a couple of days ahead of an important Nato summit and the Trump visit"".""David Davis was almost irrelevant, but Johnson was a time bomb,"" he concludes. The Dutch centre-left daily De Volkskrant has little comfort for the prime minister, saying the ""chaos in the British cabinet is complete"". Its correspondent Patrick van IJsendoorn says the ""Brexiteers' dying dream threatens to turn into a nightmare for Theresa May"". In the eurosceptic press camp, Hungary's Magyar Idok harks back to the joke in the 1980s BBC comedy Yes Minister that Britain only joined the EU in order to thwart Franco-German co-operation, adding that this has ""come back to haunt Europe"".Its editorial says ""the British are right to object to the increased central power of Brussels"", but warns that ""some kind of free trade agreement and access to the single market will, in spite of visceral objections, be unavoidable.""Mikhail Ozerov, the London correspondent of the pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda wonders ""who the US president is going to talk to when he arrives in the next few days?"" The ""infamous, unpredictable, even scandalous"" Boris Johnson has gone, and this leaves Mrs May a ""lame duck"", he declares.As for the ""more positive foreign policy towards Russia"" that several commentators hope for, Mr Ozerov deems this ""highly unlikely, alas, given the current line-up on the British Mount Olympus"". Russia's government daily Rossiyskaya Gazeta reserves judgement on whether Moscow can now expect an easier ride from Britain, but agrees that Mrs May ""barely holds sway, and has lost control over her cabinet"" Pundit Elena Ananyeva warns the RBC business daily that the resignations do not mean that Theresa May can continue her ""tilt toward a soft Brexit"", as she still has to face a ""good many supporters of the hard option"" in her cabinet and parliamentary party. Boris Johnson's resignation is big news in the Iranian media, and the consensus across the political spectrum is that it spells trouble for Theresa May.The official Channel 1 TV news says it has ""put the British government on the brink of collapse"".The pro-reform newspaper Ebtekar says the two resignations ""have deepened divisions"" in the cabinet, and the Donya-e Eqtesad financial daily describes a ""resignation tsunami.""China's state media generally note that the resignations come at a time when, as the Xinhua news agency says, ""time is running out"" for Brexit negotiations.But some reports are more interested in what new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt's China-born wife Lucia Guo could mean for relations.Jeremy Hunt is a ""Chinese son-in law"", declares the Global Times daily, while the Guancha news site is proud to announce that the ""Chinese son-in-law has come to the rescue"".

2018-07-10,Obituary: Lord Carrington,https://web.archive.org//web/20180711061501/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-12978363,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLord Carrington's political views were coloured by his experience of World War Two.Like many of his generation, he had the desire to seek out a peaceful solution to conflict, an aim he followed throughout his career.It also instilled in him a sense of honour and an acceptance that he would take full responsibility for his actions.And it was this that led him to take the blame for the government's failure to anticipate the invasion of the Falkland Islands by Argentina in 1982.Peter Carington - the family name, unlike the title, had only one ""r"" - was born on the 6 June 1919 and educated at Eton and the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. He succeeded to the title, as sixth Baron Carrington, on the death of his father, in 1938, and took his seat in the Lords on his 21st birthday, in 1940.He served in the Grenadier Guards during the War, where he reached the rank of major and was awarded the Military Cross.Turning to politics after the War, he served as parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture under Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden before moving to a similar position in the Ministry of Defence.In 1956, he was appointed high commissioner to Australia, a post he held for three years before returning to Britain and an appointment as first lord of the Admiralty under Harold MacMillan.He became leader of the Lords in the government of Sir Alec Douglas-Home, moving to opposition leader when Labour won the 1964 general election. He remained in that position until the Conservatives regained power in 1970, when the incoming Prime Minister, Edward Heath, appointed him as defence secretary.It was Heath's government that took Britain into the Common Market, something Lord Carrington supported at the time. As someone who had experienced war in Europe at first hand, he felt that joining the EEC meant that future conflicts could be avoided. He was later to express grave reservations over the way the EU had subsequently developed.When Heath's government fell, in 1974, Lord Carrington returned as leader of the opposition in the Lords until Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979. She made him foreign secretary, a job he later said he had always wanted but never thought he would get. His first major task was to end the guerrilla war against Ian Smith's government in Rhodesia and pave the way for multi-racial elections. The Lancaster House talks, which he chaired in 1979, brought the various parties together and led to the creation of Zimbabwe.The Foreign Office came in for heavy criticism for failing to predict the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands, in April 1982, and Lord Carrington resigned as foreign secretary.  He was later cleared of any personal blame by the Franks Committee, which investigated government failures over the invasion.Lord Carrington served as secretary general of Nato from 1984-1988, a time that saw the beginning of the end of the Cold War and eventually led to the break up of the Soviet Union. In the early 1990s he became the EU peace envoy to the former Yugoslavia, where, together with the Portuguese ambassador Jose Cutileiro, he drew up a plan to try to prevent Bosnia-Herzegovina descending into war. The plan was initially accepted by all sides - but the Bosnian Muslim leadership later rejected it. His final mission, at the age of 75, was to mediate between the ANC and the Zulu Inkhata party, whose disagreements threatened the first multi-racial elections in South Africa. He failed to broker an agreement but, just days after he left South Africa, the Inkhata leader, Chief Buthelezi, accepted the peace proposals.After Tony Blair's Labour government removed the right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, Lord Carrington was given a life peerage, enabling him to stay in the House.As well as his political career, he was an active businessman, chairing the auction house Christie's as well as sitting on the board of a number of public companies, including Barclay's Bank and Schweppes.He was made a Companion of Honour in 1983 and a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter two years later.

Here is a guide to Theresa May's new top team.Philip Hammond remained chancellor of the exchequer after last June's general election, despite speculation that he would be sacked.He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary.Mr Hammond was a Remain supporter in the EU referendum and is seen as one of the leading cabinet voices for a softer version of Brexit than that advocated by Leave supporting colleagues.Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery.After becoming an MP in 2010, Sajid Javid has risen swiftly through the ranks of the Conservative Party and government to become the first home secretary from an ethnic minority background.Landing the job following Amber Rudd's resignation, the son of Pakistani immigrants left behind his role as communities secretary. Mr Javid, a former executive at Deutsche Bank, has also had brief stints as business secretary and culture secretary. He stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the 2016 leadership contest, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Jeremy Hunt became foreign secretary after Boris Johnson resigned over Brexit policy in July 2018.  It meant an end to his marathon stint as health secretary, a job he took in David Cameron's 2012 reshuffle, having previously served as culture secretary.He weathered a number of controversies including a 2015 battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes.He is thought to have resisted an attempt by Theresa May to move him to another job in her January 2018 reshuffle and succeeded in adding responsibility for social care - something previously overseen by local government - to his portfolio.Long-tipped for a promotion to the Cabinet, the Leave-supporting lawyer is a former chief of staff to both David Davis, who he replaced as Brexit secretary, and leading Brexit rebel Dominic Grieve.Has worked behind-the-scenes on Brexit legal detail for the government and is reported to be ""relaxed"" about a ""no deal"" scenario. In June 2018, he called for the UK to display more ""economic self-confidence"" in talks with Brussels.Grabbed headlines as housing minister - one of a string junior ministerial posts he has held since becoming MP for Esher and Walton in 2010 - when he suggested immigration drove up house prices.A close ally of Theresa May, the former chief whip ruffled a few Tory feathers when he was handed the role of defence secretary in November 2017, with some claiming he lacked the experience for such a vital role.He replaced Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned amid allegations over his past conduct.The appointment was Mr Williamson's first cabinet post. The MP for South Staffordshire was elected to parliament in 2010, and was previously an aide to David Cameron.One of the government's great survivors, Chris Grayling has been in the cabinet since 2012, when he was made Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, before going on to serve as Commons leader. A leading voice in the Leave campaign, he was made transport secretary by Theresa May in July 2016.He defied predictions he would be sacked or moved in Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle, after attracting criticism over rising rail fares, Southern Rail's disrupted services and rail franchising difficulties.The former BBC and Channel 4 TV producer has been MP for Epsom and Ewell, in Surrey, since 2001.A veteran right winger and ardent Brexiteer, Liam Fox was put in charge of the newly-created department for international trade by Theresa May after she became PM, with the job of forging post-Brexit trade deals with other nations.He was David Cameron's first defence secretary but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Mr Fox - who was a GP before entering politics - stood in the 2016 leadership race against Theresa May, but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Michael Gove's was a dramatic comeback in June 2017, when the prime minister brought him back into cabinet as environment secretary.That was just a year after his ministerial ambitions appeared to be over when he was sacked in the 2016 reshuffle which followed Mrs May's arrival as prime minister.Before that stint as justice secretary he had previously served as David Cameron's education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. His longtime friendship with Mr Cameron ended as he became probably the then cabinet's biggest name to decide to campaign for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit and initially backing him, Mr Gove withdrew his support for Mr Johnson as Tory leader mid-contest, choosing instead to stand himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third.A former protege of Theresa May at the Home Office, Karen Bradley was handed the role of culture secretary in Mrs May's first cabinet.Her time in that job was dominated by her decision to refer Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox's takeover bid for Sky to the media and competition regulators, something that will be at the top of her successor's in-tray.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.She replaces James Brokenshire as Northern Ireland Secretary, who resigned for health reasonsDavid Gauke became the sixth justice secretary in six years - and the first solicitor to take the role - in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle.His appointment breaks a run of four consecutive non-legally qualified MPs to hold the position of the government's chief law officer.He was previously work and pensions secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury.The former City lawyer has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005. Matt Hancock was promoted to become health secretary in the wake of the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson over Brexit policy.After only a few months as culture secretary, he got the call to move up the rankings to health when Jeremy Hunt was promoted from health to foreign secretary.Mr Hancock, who was close to the former chancellor George Osborne during the David Cameron years, is a former Bank of England economist has been MP for West Suffolk since 2010.He is the first MP in modern times to win a horse race, having raced to victory at Newmarket in August 2012. And his later appearances as culture secretary included attempting to moonwalk and jumping off a wall while having a go at parkour.Greg Clark is another minister who has survived the transition from the Cameron to the May years. In his case he has been business secretary since July 2016, after a year or so looking after the local government brief.It had been widely speculated that he was to be moved in the January 2018 reshuffle to make way for Jeremy Hunt - but it did not happen after the health secretary successfully argued the case to stay put.The Middlesbrough-born former business consultant, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, started his political journey as president of the Liberal Democrat student branch at Magdalene College, Cambridge.James Brokenshire returned to the cabinet following the reshuffle prompted by Amber Rudd's resignation as home secretary.The former Northern Ireland secretary had stepped down in January due to ill health after being diagnosed with the early stages of lung cancer - but was back in Parliament a month later after ""recovering strongly"" from lung surgery.The former lawyer is a close ally of Theresa May, having served under her for five years at the Home Office.Jeremy Wright was promoted from attorney general to be the new culture secretary after Matt Hancock's promotion to health secretary in July 2018. The moves were in Theresa May's reshuffle in the wake of David Davis and Boris Johnson's Brexit resignations.A barrister specialising in criminal law, Mr Wright became an MP in 2005, serving in the whips office for the Conservatives under David Cameron from 2007 to 2012 before becoming a justice minister in 2012 and becoming attorney general in 2014.Penny Mordaunt replaced Priti Patel in this role in November 2016, after Ms Patel resigned in the wake of disclosures that she had held a series of unofficial meetings with senior Israeli figures.Ms Mordaunt was previously minister of state for disabled people at the Department of Work and Pensions.She was minister for the armed forces under David Cameron, and had been considered a contender to replace Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary.Penny Mordaunt, elected to parliament in 2010 as MP for Portsmouth North, is also known for her strong support of Brexit.Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016 - her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation, headed by controversial journalist Toby Young, which runs the free schools programme.One of 13 Scottish Conservatives to be elected to the Commons in the June 2017 snap election.Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post of Scottish Secretary when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.In January 2015, Mr Mundell became the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet minister.The former GMTV presenter was seen as a rising star in David Cameron's government after winning her Wirral West seat in the 2010 general election.She lost the seat to Labour in 2015 but returned to Parliament in 2017 as MP for former Chancellor George Osborne's old Tatton constituency.She was promoted to deputy chief whip in the reshuffle that followed Sir Michael Fallon's resignation and two months later was promoted again, gaining a seat at the cabinet table for the first time in the department she had served in as a junior minister under Mr Cameron.Damian Hinds got an unexpected promotion when he was drafted in to replace Justine Greening, who refused a move to the Department for Work and Pensions in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle.The former management consultant was a Remain supporter and previously served as employment minister in the DWP and before that a junior Treasury minister and government whip. He has been MP for East Hampshire since May 2010.Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remained in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle.The former banker and Welsh assembly member was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport. He became an MP in 2010.Former Commons Leader David Lidington replaced Damian Green, who resigned in December 2017 after misconduct allegations.The Remain supporter did not take on Mr Green's First Secretary of State title but will still play part of that role, standing in for Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions and chairing key cabinet Brexit committees. He is a former justice secretary and Europe minister.The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto.The new Conservative Party chairman takes the title of minister without portfolio, allowing him to take a seat in the cabinet.He replaced Sir Patrick McLoughlin, who stood down as Tory chairman.The former housing minister briefly served as immigration minister before taking on the job of rebuilding the Tories' campaigning strength for the next general election.A former barrister and leader of Brentwood council, in Essex, he has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010.Leader of the CommonsAndrea LeadsomChief Secretary to the TreasuryLiz TrussChief whipJulian SmithAttorney General Geoffrey CoxImmigration ministerCaroline NokesEnergy minister Claire Perry"
2018-07-10,The view from EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20180711061501/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44770630,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDavid Davis's resignation was met with a collective shrug of the shoulders in Brussels on Monday. ""How can we miss a man who was never here?"", one EU source commented to me. The Brexit secretary made one visit to Brussels in the last four months. A far more familiar face here is Olly Robbins, the prime minister's Europe adviser. The EU is reassured that he's staying in his post - for now. But the mood in Brussels - especially after hearing this afternoon that Boris Johnson too was gone - is far from blasé.The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said Europe was deeply troubled not by British cabinet resignations, but by Brexit itself.""Politicians come and go,"" he said. ""But the problems they have created for the people remain. The mess caused by Brexit is the biggest problem in the history of EU-UK relations. And it is still very far from being solved.""A sense of unease hangs heavy.""Theresa May is respected in Europe,"" one contact told me. ""But so many times since this Brexit process began, we've had to ask ourselves: will she stay or will she go? And now here we are again.""Political uncertainty in Britain makes the possibility of a no-deal Brexit seem far more likely in the eyes of Brussels bureaucrats. Not because either side want it, but because time for EU-UK negotiations - as the European Commission never tires of repeating - is simply running out.And if the prime minister does indeed survive, what then? Most EU sources I spoke to believe she will. One compared the prime minister to Germany's Angela Merkel and said both women were consistently under-estimated.Listen to Theresa May's impassioned address to Parliament today - promising a return to UK sovereignty after Brexit, yet simultaneously keeping close ties to Europe (no country with an EU association agreement has so far avoided signing up to binding relations), with frictionless trade and a close customs relationship that is not a customs union (honest), while remaining free to strike the UK's own trade deals.The EU is holding fire for now on her plan. Leaders are mindful of not wanting to further weaken Theresa May at home by rushing forward with their manifold objections - but it's just a matter of time. The next Brexit negotiating round is pencilled in for a week today.Now, Downing Street believes that the hot water the prime minister is in today will shock EU leaders into realising they need to start compromising themselves - not just perpetually demanding capitulations on the UK's red lines. Privately, key EU figures admit there will be some give from Brussels - eventually. But how much?Certainly not what would be needed to make Theresa May's proposed third way for Brexit work as she currently presents it.""On the one hand, it's true what Downing Street says,"" one EU source told me. ""The UK is bigger than Norway and strategically, politically and economically more important to us than Switzerland, yes. But EU countries benefit more from keeping their club - the single market and customs union - intact, than they would do by compromising everything just for the sake of better bilateral relations with the UK after Brexit. You can forget it.""The EU definitely expects more concessions from Theresa May in negotiations if she wants what she describes as a deep and special partnership post Brexit.But the bottom line in Brussels is: hard or soft, Brexit must be done in time.Whether Theresa May or another is at the helm in the UK, EU diplomats say they need a leader who has to power to make a deal in Brussels and see it through back home.Otherwise, they believe a disorderly no-deal Brexit beckons - with all the consequences they think that will have in the UK and across the EU."
2018-07-10,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180711061501/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks  are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-10,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180711061501/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Robbins said it was also ""really noticeable that he will barely spend any time in London"" - perhaps to avoid the protests. Mrs May said the visit would be an opportunity to boost trade links and strengthen co-operation on security.But she also warned Mr Trump not to ignore the ""malign behaviour"" of Russia when he meets Vladimir Putin in Helsinki next week.Mr Trump had joked earlier this week that his meeting with the Russian leader ""may be the easiest"" part of his European trip.Along with trade and security links, Downing Street said the other key areas to be discussed between the two leaders included Brexit and the Middle East.Ahead of Mr Trump's visit, Mrs May said: ""As two nations - we are safer, more prosperous and more creative when we work together and I am looking forward to this week's important discussions.""She said that when the UK leaves the European Union ""there will be no alliance more important in the years ahead"".Downing Street insisted Mrs May welcomed Mr Trump's decision to ""engage"" with the Russian leader in the Finnish capital on Monday.However No 10 also made clear that she expected him to raise issues like the Salisbury nerve agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia.Mrs May said: ""Our long term objective remains a constructive relationship with Moscow. If we are to be successful in this we must keep engaging individually and as an alliance.""That is why I welcome President Trump's forthcoming meeting with President Putin - open channels of communication between the US and Russia are key to managing the risks of confrontation.""Mr Trump will arrive in the UK with his wife Melania on Thursday afternoon, following the Nato summit.The couple will attend a dinner, hosted by Mrs May, at Blenheim Palace - the ancestral home of Sir Winston Churchill - on Thursday evening. Cabinet members, including Chancellor Philip Hammond and the new foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, as well as business leaders, will be among the guests.On Friday, Mrs May and Mr Trump will go to to watch a joint counter-terrorism exercise by British and US special forces at a military base. The pair will then travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for talks with the foreign secretary.The president and first lady will travel to Windsor on Friday afternoon to meet the Queen, before flying to Scotland to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort. This part of the visit is being considered private.The Police Federation has warned the visit will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces.Tens of thousands of people are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday - and in Glasgow on Saturday.Police forces from across the country have been asked to send officers to assist the Metropolitan Police. Smaller demonstrations are also expected to be held across the UK, including Devon, Dundee, Edinburgh, Belfast, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool.Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit."

Senior ministers Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned, saying they cannot support the proposals.Some Tory backbenchers and other Brexit campaigners are also unhappy, saying it means the UK will be too closely tied to the EU.The government has now published a White Paper giving more details of its plans.They are aimed at avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland, securing frictionless trade with the EU while also leaving the single market and customs union and regaining control of the UK's borders. The UK would accept a ""common rule book"" for trade in goods, but not services.There are also plans for what is described as an ""association agreement"", with ""joint institutional arrangements"" between the EU and the UK.The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, after the 2016 referendum in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Brexit. The two sides are negotiating outstanding issues related to its departure as well as the outline of their future relationship once a proposed transition period comes to an end, on 31 December 2020.Both are aiming for an agreement by October, to allow enough time for the UK and European parliaments to vote on what is decided. Dominic Raab, who became Brexit secretary on Monday after Mr Davis quit, told people who are ""criticising or carping"" about the plan that they needed to come up with credible alternatives of their own.The White Paper is not the final deal, as the detailed talks are yet to take place with the EU. The EU has welcomed its publication and said it will respond when it has seen the plans in detail."

The proposals, to be debated by MPs, will only see complaints from 2017 onwards investigated.But leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, said she was determined to push them through. Last autumn, Westminster allegations of harassment and bullying. The scandal claimed the ministerial careers of two cabinet ministers and elicited promises from all of the political parties that nothing like this would ever happen again. But many months later, three of the political activists who came forward to tell their stories told Radio 4's Today that hardly anything has changed, and that victims are still too scared to speak out.James Greenhalgh, who says he was assaulted by an unnamed MP when he was an intern in 2012, told the BBC he knew of someone who had gone through the same ordeal but did not feel able to come forward.He said he had no confidence in the current grievance system and ""nothing had changed"" in terms of the culture at Westminster.""My view is - almost as if when allegations came out, the tide went out and exposed the nasty rock pools. The tide has come back in and no-one is acting because they can't see it,"" he said. But Ms Leadsom said she wanted the new grievance and complaints procedures to be up and running before the start of the summer recess next week.""I am focused on reaching the point when anyone can come forward and complain about any single person they work with or interact with in the knowledge the complaint will be taken seriously,"" she said.""I'm absolutely determined that we will have resolution of this and in short order.""For me the key to this is to create and promote a culture that makes this a great place to work and is a role model for other parliaments and places round the world."""
2018-07-11,New mums' data 'illegally sold to Labour',https://web.archive.org//web/20180712081418/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44794635,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA company that offers pregnant women and new parents health advice and gifts, faces a fine for illegally sharing more than a million people's personal data with the Labour Party.The UK's data watchdog intends to issue the owner of the Emma's Diary service a £140,000 penalty.It said Lifecycle Marketing had sold the data for use in the 2017 general election campaign without disclosing it might do so.The firm disputes the findings.""We were not given an opportunity to respond to the detail of the ICO's intended enforcement action prior to the report being published,"" said a spokeswoman.""As a result, details of the ICO's findings, including those being reported by the press, contain significant factual inaccuracies which we trust will be corrected.""She declined, however, to say what the errors were.It is common for political parties to buy personal information to target their campaigns, but appropriate consent must have been obtained by the providers.Labour has said that it will review its ""approach to acquiring data from third parties"" in light of the report.One legal expert said the intervention was likely to cause wider concern.""After the Obama campaigns, political parties saw the need to step up their data game, and at the time the playing field was not worked out,"" said Sam Fowles from Cornerstone Barristers.""They will certainly be worried now about whether they overstepped the mark in light of this.""The Information Commissioner's Office revealed its planned punishment in a footnote to a report about the misuse of personal data during the Brexit referendum.It said it would not normally announce its intention to impose a fine until it had completed its inquiries, but believed in this case that there was an ""overriding public interest to do so"".The ICO said that on 5 May 2017, Lifecycle Marketing has supplied 1,065,200 records to the data broker Experian Marketing Services for use by Labour.Each record included:The ICO said the Buckinghamshire-based Lifecycle Marketing had understood the data would be used by a mail campaign promoting Labour's family-friendly policies in 106 constituencies.Emma's Diary is promoted by the Royal College of General Practitioners among others, and its information packs are distributed by many GPs and midwives.The benefits of joining include tailored emails with pregnancy and breastfeeding advice, as well as discount vouchers for high street stores and gift packs including nappies, baby wipes and other similar items.A companion app also allows mothers-to-be to keep a journal of their pregnancies and make a time-lapse video of their growing bumps.The business' privacy policy stated that in return for such benefits, users permit third parties to contact them for marketing purposes.But while the policy had listed several business sectors and specific companies that might get the data, the ICO said there had been no mention of political parties.In fact, the watchdog added, the policy was only amended to do so in January 2018 after the ICO had told the company it was under investigation.This, the regulator concluded, breached the Data Protection Act's ""fairness"" requirement that organisations be transparent about how gathered personal data might be used.It added that there may also have been a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.In considering the size of its penalty, the watchdog said it had taken into account that it understood Lifecycle Marketing had not shared personal data with a political party on any other occasion, and had expected the information to be deleted after the general election vote.But it added that it was not clear how the firm could be confident that the data had indeed been permanently erased.The ICO added that it would make a final ruling after hearing back from Lifecycle Marketing, and would confirm the size of the penalty on or after 30 July.""[We] will be submitting our written representations to challenge the ICO's findings in accordance with the usual process,"" said a spokeswoman for Lifecycle Marketing in response.Experian Marketing Services said that it was aware of the ICO's concerns and would ""remain vigilant when it comes to data security and integrity"".The ICO has said it wants the UK's 11 main political parties to have their data-sharing practices audited later this year and said it also has ""outstanding enquiries with a number of data brokers"".""[In the past] there had been a much looser interpretation of the fairness principle, and it wasn't applied as tightly and rigorously as it has been in this case,"" Mr Fowles

Here's what happened.With Theresa May at the Nato summit in Brussels, the PMQs ""B team"" stepped in to the breach.David Lidington, who is effectively Mrs May's second-in-command, congratulated Gareth Southgate and his England team and wished them ""the very best"", ahead of tonight's World Cup semi-final against Croatia.Then - just to get it out of the way - he had a joke at the expense of Jeremy Corbyn's stand-in Emily Thornberry, who four years ago was forced to quit the Labour front bench over what was branded a ""snobby"" tweet about a house decked out in England football flags. Mr Lidington offered to buy the shadow foreign secretary - who at the time denied the tweet was snobby and apologised for any offence caused by it - an England flag for the game.

""It takes some of us back to the 1970s, we are very pleased to have you,"" he told Kelly and Merrill Osmond.Ms Thornberry began by revealing that she would be not be watching tonight's England game because she would be representing the Labour Party at a service to commemorate the Srebrenica genocide. This was a subject close to her heart, she explained to MPs, because her father, one-time UN Assistant Secretary General Cedric Thornberry, had played a role ""in trying to prevent it"".It was the only England game she had missed, she assured MPs, before wishing the team the ""best of luck"".“What can be achieved when all the individual players work effectively as a team...” @EmilyThornberry taunts @DLidington ahead of #ENGCRO game #pmqs https://t.co/0lyRrv4v4q pic.twitter.com/z8pUtHDnoHEnd of Twitter post 2 by @BBCPoliticsShe may know ""very little about football"", she went on, but even she knew the importance of teamwork and listening to the manager.

She may have run a little aground in the sands of euro-detail, but the politics was surely correct, and as usual the pre-baked jokes were suitably biting. After this, any lingering notion that the government could rely on being bailed out by Labour votes if faced with a backbench rebellion against Chequers can be laid to rest.   David Lidington remained, as ever, a calm professional presence at the Dispatch Box, and his riposte, that Labour's Brexit policy was the best kept secret in Westminster, hit home. These exchanges got unusually detailed, but it was never really about the detail. No-one who's been out and about in Westminster in the last couple of days can be in any doubt about the jittery combination of brave faces and angry nervousness in the hearts of Tory MPs. This was about keeping those hearts a-flutter, and not in a good way. Most backbenchers stayed out of the Brexiting but the Conservative Julia Lopez put down a marker about keeping faith with the referendum, and her words gave a clue about how high feelings are running.Elsewhere, there were a couple of Conservative questions about crime - suggesting the issue is climbing up the league-table of concerns. Keep an eye on that; it could goad the new Home Secretary (and possible future PM) Sajid Javid into action.An audio download of some of the key exchanges, and what Andrew Neil and his Daily Politics guests made of the exchanges.The highlights of #pmqs with reaction from our panel @afneil @bbclaurak @IanLaveryMP @RobertBuckland for your phone, tablet or PCDownload and listen here 📻https://t.co/uWJg9ma6lsEnd of Twitter post 2 by @daily_politics"

The society said some examples were ""genuinely shocking, disturbing and criminal"".The ERS said harassment and abuse were among the barriers putting people off entering politics.A total of 266 politicians responded to the ERS survey, including 224 councillors, 26 AMs, 11 MPs and one MEP. Of them, 40 respondents said they had suffered abuse online and one AM said she had suffered racist abuse.One politician told the survey they were sent excrement through the post ""in a (very tacky) Valentine's card"".Bethan Sayed, a Plaid Cymru AM, said she had experienced racial attacks since her marriage to Cardiff International Film Festival founder Rahil Sayed, who is from India.She told BBC Radio Wales she had been sworn at and had comments about her appearance and racist abuse about her name and wedding dress on social media.""I haven't really ever experienced those things, because I've got the most [Welsh name], Bethan Jenkins, I come from the south Wales valleys, and you've never had to face those sort of racist comments before,"" she said.""I can't even imagine what people from BME backgrounds are having to go through in their every day lives if that's what I get within two or three months of getting married.""She said people needed to be educated more about what politicians actually do, as she said part of the tension stemmed from people feeling frustrated at things not changing fast enough.""People say to me 'well just put up with it', and 'get on with it', but should we really have to,"" she said.Two politicians talked about suffering sexual harassment while undertaking elected duty. One said they received ""inappropriate sexual advances by constituents during advice surgeries and during door-to-door canvassing sessions"".Another recounted that they were once ""slapped on the bottom"", and that someone had attempted to pull them under a tree and kiss them.One respondent told the survey: ""When I worked for politicians I had access to their social media, answered the phone on their behalf and opened their correspondence.""I opened an envelope with razor blades stuck to the inside.""The respondent added that a rock and a traffic cone were thrown at the politician's shop-front office window, ""shattering the glass all over my colleague"". They added that a constituent had stalked them to their home.""I have been a councillor for 14 years, I've won four elections and I've never had so much hassle or dissent as I have had in the last two years,"" Debbie Wilcox, leader of Newport council, said in evidence to the ERS.Jess Blair, director ERS Cymru, said Welsh political parties should develop a joint code of conduct on intimidating behaviour.She said: ""If you look at politics from the outside, if you are a normal person sitting at home thinking 'I could do that' and you think whether you want to be trolled on social media or whether you want to be away from your family half the week, whether you want to travel huge distances; those things are a massive barrier - more than actually standing for a political party.""The realities of public life need to be addressed."""
2018-07-11,Call to 'sanction' welfare minister rejected,https://web.archive.org//web/20180712081418/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44792480,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour's attempts to ""sanction"" Esther McVey for her handling of the rollout of Universal Credit have failed.A Commons motion calling for the work and pensions secretary to be docked a month of her ministerial pay was rejected by 305 votes to 268. She apologised last week for misleading MPs about a watchdog's assessment of the controversial new benefit system.But she robustly defended progress so far on Wednesday, saying 3.3 million people had been helped into work.Sanctions are imposed against welfare claimants who are deemed not to have complied with agreed commitments.Labour's motion demanded an equivalent penalty to be applied to the minister, saying benefit claimants had been penalised for ""far less"". The motion said people claiming Universal Credit were suffering financial problems but that the government had refused to pause its expansion across the country.Opening the debate, Labour's welfare spokeswoman Margaret Greenwood said Ms McVey had ""undermined"" a ""damning"" National Audit Office report about Universal Credit, which combines several working-age benefits into a single payment and is currently being rolled out nationwide.Ms McVey defended the scheme, saying it had helped over 3.3 million people into work.She demanded an apology from Labour for ""misleading statements"" about the impact of welfare reform, its record managing the welfare system in government and a remark by Labour's John McDonnell during the  2015 general election campaign about ""lynching"" her.Last week the secretary of state said she had ""mistakenly"" told MPs the National Audit Office felt the benefit was progressing too slowly and should be rolled out faster and apologised for ""inadvertently misleading"" Parliament. But she stood by her assertion that the NAO had not been able to examine the impact of recent changes to how claimants were receiving their payments as they ""were still being felt and by definition, couldn't have been fully taken into account by the report"".In May Labour tried a similar technique on Transport Secretary Chris Grayling but its bid to fine him the cost of a railway season ticket was outvoted."
2018-07-11,Facebook faces maximum fine for data misuse,https://web.archive.org//web/20180712081418/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44785151,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK's data protection watchdog intends to fine Facebook £500,000 for data breaches - the maximum allowed.The Information Commissioner's Office said Facebook had failed to ensure another company - Cambridge Analytica - had deleted users' data.The ICO will also bring a criminal action against Cambridge Analytica's defunct parent company SCL Elections. And it has raised concerns about political parties buying personal information from ""data brokers"".Facebook said it would respond to the report ""soon"".The ICO also said another company - Aggregate IQ - which worked with the Vote Leave campaign in the run up to the EU Referendum - must stop processing UK citizens' data.The action comes 16 months after the ICO began its probe into political campaigners' use of personal data following concerns raised by whistleblower Christopher Wylie, among others.Mr Wylie, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica - a London-based political consulting firm - said his company had made unauthorised use of personal data harvested from millions of Facebook users.  The ICO found that Facebook had breached its own rules and failed to make sure that Cambridge Analytica had deleted this personal data.While Cambridge Analytica insisted it had indeed wiped the data after Facebook's erasure request in December 2015, the ICO said it had seen evidence that copies of the data had been shared with others.""This potentially brings into question the accuracy of the deletion certificates provided to Facebook,"" said an ICO spokesperson.Responding to the ICO report, Mr Wylie said: ""Months ago, I reported Facebook and Cambridge Analytica to the UK authorities.  ""Based on that evidence, Facebook is today being issued with the maximum fine allowed under British law. ""Cambridge Analytica, including possibly its directors, will be criminally prosecuted.""The ICO has also written to the UK's 11 main political parties compelling them to have their data protection practices audited.It is concerned the parties may have bought lifestyle information about members of the public from data brokers, who might have not have obtained the necessary consent.In particular, the ICO raised concern about one data broker: Emma's Diary. The firm offers medical advice to pregnant women and gift packs after babies are born.The ICO said it was concerned about how transparent the firm had been about its political activities.It said that the Labour Party had confirmed using the firm, but did not provide other details at this point beyond saying it intended to take some form of regulatory action.The service's owner Lifecycle Marketing could not be reached for comment. But it has told the Guardian that it does not agree with the ICO's findings.Looking wider, the ICO noted that Facebook had been the biggest recipient of digital advertising by political parties and campaigns to date. Yet, it said, the US firm had neither done enough to explain to its members how they were being targeted as a consequence, nor given them enough control over how their sensitive personal data was used.As a result, it said, Facebook was guilty of two breaches of the Data Protection Act.The tech firm's chief privacy officer has issued a brief response.""As we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015,"" said Erin Egan.""We have been working closely with the ICO in their investigation of Cambridge Analytica, just as we have with authorities in the US and other countries. We're reviewing the report and will respond to the ICO soon.""Cambridge Analytica and its parent SCL Elections began insolvency proceedings in May.But the ICO said it was still taking legal steps to bring a criminal prosecution against the business.The basis for this would be that SCL Elections had failed to properly respond to an earlier demand that it give a US academic a copy of any personal information it held on him along with an explanation as to its source and usage.Prof David Carroll first asked for the data in January 2017, and the ICO served a related enforcement order four months later.Bearing in mind SCL Elections is now out of business, the ICO said it might consider taking action against the company's directors.""A successful prosecution may result in a conviction and an unlimited fine,"" added a spokeswoman.The ICO said it had established that the Canadian data analytics firm AggregateIQ - AIQ - had access to UK voters' personal data provided by the Brexit referendum's Vote Leave campaign.It said it was now investigating whether this information had been transferred and accessed outside the UK and whether this amounted to a breach of the data protection act.The watchdog added that it continued to investigate to what degree AIQ and SCL Elections had shared UK personal data.And it said it had served an enforcement notice forbidding AIQ from continuing to make use of a list of UK citizens' email addresses and names that it still holds.Other action includes:The ICO said it expects the next stage of its investigation to be complete by the end of October."
2018-07-11,UK to send 440 more troops to Afghanistan,https://web.archive.org//web/20180712081418/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44787636,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK is to send 440 more non-combat troops to Afghanistan, the prime minister will announce at the Brussels Nato summit.The commitment to Nato's mission in Afghanistan will take the total number of UK troops in the country to 1,090.Around half of the troops will deploy from the Welsh Guards in August and the remainder will follow by February 2019.They will help ""bring the stability and security that the Afghan people deserve,"" Theresa May said.At the height of the war, Nato had  more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone. As of last month, the number of Nato personnel stood at 16,000 from 39 countries, operating mainly from Kabul and focusing on training and assisting the army and police.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson - who wrote to Mrs May recommending more troops - said ""whenever the call comes, the UK is always one of the first to step up and support our friends and allies across the globe"".Nato asked Britain to deploy more troops a year ago. In September of last year, the US committed an extra 3,000 troops to support Afghan forces.Ahead of the summit, which begins on Wednesday, US president Donald Trump, hit out at his Nato allies for failing to spend enough on defence. ""The US is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them,"" Mr Trump tweeted.Analysis by BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale Sending another 440 British troops will make the UK the third biggest contributor to the Nato train, advise, and assist mission in Afghanistan.The extra troops will arrive later this summer and will reinforce the UK-led Kabul Security Force. It is not a return to a combat role. Its primary role is to transport international advisers safely around the capital - what British soldiers have dubbed ""Armoured Uber"".The US leader's main objection is that a number of member states have not increased their defence budgets to the target of 2% of economic output.But Mrs May said she expects ""to agree an ambitious package of measures to strengthen our deterrence and defence"" at the summit. ""And we will continue to make the case for all allies to follow the UK's example and meet the 2% pledge,"" she added.The last UK combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014 after being involved in the conflict since 2001.The additional troops will add to Britain's existing contribution to the UK-led Kabul Security Force and mentor the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces in the country's capital. ""Lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan will help keep the streets of Britain safe and this uplift signals our unwavering commitment to realising that future,"" Mr Williamson said."

However it is restoring it back to what Charles Barry had in mind.""Something that people will notice is a contrast between the clock face and the clock hands and the surrounding tower.""All four home nations are represented on the clock through shields featuring a rose, leek, shamrock and thistle.Adam Watrobski, Parliament's principal architect, described the clock as the ""crowning glory"" of the restoration, saying it reinforced the ""symbolism of the tower in its international representation of the United Kingdom"".He added: ""Using historic paint analysis and references, including Barry's original design watercolour, contemporary illustrations and archival photographs, we have recreated the original colour scheme.""

2018-07-11,The Commons library: 200 years of history,https://web.archive.org//web/20180712081418/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44699363,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe House of Commons library has played a quiet part in 200 years of British political history.Unknown to many outside Westminster, it shapes important decisions by giving MPs impartial briefings on the issues of the day - from education to Brexit.Home to hundreds of thousands of documents, the library is opening up as it celebrates its bicentennial. Penny Young, the Commons librarian, spoke to BBC News about the library's unique role.The library has experienced a somewhat inauspicious sequence of events. Founded in 1818 to house the Commons journal, it soon outgrew its original rooms and moved to bigger premises 10 years later. But this only lasted another six years before the famous fire that destroyed much of the Palace of Westminster in 1834. Thanks to some quick-thinking staff, some original Elizabethan-age petitions and records were saved by being thrown from the window, but much of the library's original collection was lost to the ages.But the devastation did create ""an opportunity to rethink the library,"" Ms Young says, and it moved into its current ""magnificent"" home in 1852.Disaster nearly struck again almost a century later when, during the war, an anti-aircraft missile came through a window and ""smashed through the floor"".The library survived relatively unscathed - although you can still see a book scorched by the bomb - whereas the House chamber ""did not get off so lightly during the war"".Ms Young stresses that, despite these dramas, perhaps the seminal moment in the library's history was its change from a reference to a research library in 1946.This is when it acquired its modern function, eventually hiring expert researchers to produce thousands of briefings for MPs.Despite being a ""sometimes frustrating place,"" Penny Young says it is these staff and their expertise which make the library a brilliant place to work. ""They are fantastically fast and they know an awful lot,"" she says. ""My favourite thing about the library is being constantly amazed at what they produce.""They are dedicated public servants, she says, and pride themselves on fulfilling their duty to be impartial. ""We tell it like it is,"" she adds, and the library enjoys high levels of trust and respect from MPs, despite sometimes publishing ""uncomfortable"" findings.There are 900 pieces of research published a year, both long investigations and quick briefs on topics of the day.The subjects the library briefs on naturally change with the times. ""If there's something really contentious going through Parliament, that will create a lot of demand,"" Ms Young says, so obviously Brexit has dominated for the past few years.But some things stay the same. MPs are always most concerned with the issues which their constituents bring to them at their weekly surgeries. ""People talk of MPs as the social worker of last resort, when people have nowhere to go,"" Ms Young says, and so they make lots of enquiries about immigration, housing, schooling and health. ""The issues that really matter to citizens,"" as Ms Young describes them.While the public can visit and engage with Westminster in a variety of ways, they almost never see the library, says Ms Young. Despite its critical role in political life, it is normally a private space. But as it celebrates its anniversary, Ms Young and her staff are opening the library up to the public.There has already been a fully-booked set of tours, with another due in later in the year. Ms Young encourages the public to follow the library on Twitter to see when tickets become available.Getting the public in is important, Ms Young says, because they pay for the library's work. So she is also celebrating online, ""We've created a film about what the library does and its history,"" she says, as well as a piece full of the personal stories of staff throughout the years.""We know that Parliament doesn't have the best of reputations,"" she says, ""so to be able to showcase a part of Parliament that is really trusted and has a real impact on what happens, I think will help the public understand what Parliament does - and believe in the institution even more, which would be great."""

""It smashes the hard-won Brexit compromise plan to pieces,"" writes London correspondent Florentin Collomp. ""The knives are out in the alleys of Westminster, where the summer promises to be hot"" for the prime minister, he warns. Philippe Bernard of the centre-left Le Monde is not so sure whether Mr Johnson's resignation means ""the beginning of the end for Theresa May... or the beginning of the end of her worries"".He says that after two years of ""futile skirmishes on Brexit, the boil has finally been lanced"" by Mrs May's shift towards keeping close ties with the EU. German commentators can't help drawing World Cup parallels, none more blatant that centre-left Spiegel Online's comparison of the prime minister to England manager Gareth Southgate.""They both want to win game after game, but the difference is that while Southgate has yet to get through the semi-finals, May's final game has already begun,"" writes correspondent Joerg Schindler.He expects hardline Tory Brexiteer MPs to see Boris Johnson's resignation as a ""signal to revolt"" against the prime minister's leadership.""It will be no consolation if Britain wins another penalty shoot-out, as EU statutes do not provide for extra time over Brexit,"" Spiegel concludes.  In Berlin's liberal Der Tagesspiegel, Albrecht Meier also predicts a ""revolt in Westminster"" after Boris Johnson's resignation, adding that ""the prime minister must fear for her job"".As for the EU negotiators in Brussels, they have ""no choice but to wait for the outcome of the political drama in London. There will not be much time left for the negotiations in Brussels... as both sides are still far from the final goal,"" he writes. Dominic Johnson, the foreign editor of the left-wing Tageszeitung, says the breach between Mrs May and the two departing ministers is ""not just about Brexit, but also about loyalty, cabinet discipline, and work ethic"". He dubs Boris Johnson a ""scatterbrain ever since he took office two years ago, while David Davis has had only four hours of talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier this year, and has played no active role since March"". Spanish papers focus on the probable delays to the talks in Brussels, Barcelona's La Vanguardia sees Mrs May ""walking a tightrope"" in the ""worst crisis of her government"". ""Brussels is still waiting for the umpteenth British proposal, while time and patience are running out,"" it warns. The EU correspondent of centre-right El Mundo says Boris Johnson's departure is no great loss to diplomacy. ""A chatterbox with exaggerated ambitions that drove nearly the world mad,"" writes Pablo R. Suanzes, who notes that the foreign secretary chose to quit ""in the week when a British citizen died of nerve-agent poisoning, and a couple of days ahead of an important Nato summit and the Trump visit"".""David Davis was almost irrelevant, but Johnson was a time bomb,"" he concludes. The Dutch centre-left daily De Volkskrant has little comfort for the prime minister, saying the ""chaos in the British cabinet is complete"". Its correspondent Patrick van IJsendoorn says the ""Brexiteers' dying dream threatens to turn into a nightmare for Theresa May"". In the eurosceptic press camp, Hungary's Magyar Idok harks back to the joke in the 1980s BBC comedy Yes Minister that Britain only joined the EU in order to thwart Franco-German co-operation, adding that this has ""come back to haunt Europe"".Its editorial says ""the British are right to object to the increased central power of Brussels"", but warns that ""some kind of free trade agreement and access to the single market will, in spite of visceral objections, be unavoidable.""Mikhail Ozerov, the London correspondent of the pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda wonders ""who the US president is going to talk to when he arrives in the next few days?"" The ""infamous, unpredictable, even scandalous"" Boris Johnson has gone, and this leaves Mrs May a ""lame duck"", he declares.As for the ""more positive foreign policy towards Russia"" that several commentators hope for, Mr Ozerov deems this ""highly unlikely, alas, given the current line-up on the British Mount Olympus"". Russia's government daily Rossiyskaya Gazeta reserves judgement on whether Moscow can now expect an easier ride from Britain, but agrees that Mrs May ""barely holds sway, and has lost control over her cabinet"" Pundit Elena Ananyeva warns the RBC business daily that the resignations do not mean that Theresa May can continue her ""tilt toward a soft Brexit"", as she still has to face a ""good many supporters of the hard option"" in her cabinet and parliamentary party. Boris Johnson's resignation is big news in the Iranian media, and the consensus across the political spectrum is that it spells trouble for Theresa May.The official Channel 1 TV news says it has ""put the British government on the brink of collapse"".The pro-reform newspaper Ebtekar says the two resignations ""have deepened divisions"" in the cabinet, and the Donya-e Eqtesad financial daily describes a ""resignation tsunami.""China's state media generally note that the resignations come at a time when, as the Xinhua news agency says, ""time is running out"" for Brexit negotiations.But some reports are more interested in what new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt's China-born wife Lucia Guo could mean for relations.Jeremy Hunt is a ""Chinese son-in law"", declares the Global Times daily, while the Guancha news site is proud to announce that the ""Chinese son-in-law has come to the rescue"".

Here is a guide to Theresa May's new top team.Philip Hammond remained chancellor of the exchequer after last June's general election, despite speculation that he would be sacked.He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary.Mr Hammond was a Remain supporter in the EU referendum and is seen as one of the leading cabinet voices for a softer version of Brexit than that advocated by Leave supporting colleagues.Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery.After becoming an MP in 2010, Sajid Javid has risen swiftly through the ranks of the Conservative Party and government to become the first home secretary from an ethnic minority background.Landing the job following Amber Rudd's resignation, the son of Pakistani immigrants left behind his role as communities secretary. Mr Javid, a former executive at Deutsche Bank, has also had brief stints as business secretary and culture secretary. He stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the 2016 leadership contest, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Jeremy Hunt became foreign secretary after Boris Johnson resigned over Brexit policy in July 2018.  It meant an end to his marathon stint as health secretary, a job he took in David Cameron's 2012 reshuffle, having previously served as culture secretary.He weathered a number of controversies including a 2015 battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes.He is thought to have resisted an attempt by Theresa May to move him to another job in her January 2018 reshuffle and succeeded in adding responsibility for social care - something previously overseen by local government - to his portfolio.Long-tipped for a promotion to the Cabinet, the Leave-supporting lawyer is a former chief of staff to both David Davis, who he replaced as Brexit secretary, and leading Brexit rebel Dominic Grieve.Has worked behind-the-scenes on Brexit legal detail for the government and is reported to be ""relaxed"" about a ""no deal"" scenario. In June 2018, he called for the UK to display more ""economic self-confidence"" in talks with Brussels.Grabbed headlines as housing minister - one of a string junior ministerial posts he has held since becoming MP for Esher and Walton in 2010 - when he suggested immigration drove up house prices.A close ally of Theresa May, the former chief whip ruffled a few Tory feathers when he was handed the role of defence secretary in November 2017, with some claiming he lacked the experience for such a vital role.He replaced Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned amid allegations over his past conduct.The appointment was Mr Williamson's first cabinet post. The MP for South Staffordshire was elected to parliament in 2010, and was previously an aide to David Cameron.One of the government's great survivors, Chris Grayling has been in the cabinet since 2012, when he was made Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, before going on to serve as Commons leader. A leading voice in the Leave campaign, he was made transport secretary by Theresa May in July 2016.He defied predictions he would be sacked or moved in Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle, after attracting criticism over rising rail fares, Southern Rail's disrupted services and rail franchising difficulties.The former BBC and Channel 4 TV producer has been MP for Epsom and Ewell, in Surrey, since 2001.A veteran right winger and ardent Brexiteer, Liam Fox was put in charge of the newly-created department for international trade by Theresa May after she became PM, with the job of forging post-Brexit trade deals with other nations.He was David Cameron's first defence secretary but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Mr Fox - who was a GP before entering politics - stood in the 2016 leadership race against Theresa May, but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Michael Gove's was a dramatic comeback in June 2017, when the prime minister brought him back into cabinet as environment secretary.That was just a year after his ministerial ambitions appeared to be over when he was sacked in the 2016 reshuffle which followed Mrs May's arrival as prime minister.Before that stint as justice secretary he had previously served as David Cameron's education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. His longtime friendship with Mr Cameron ended as he became probably the then cabinet's biggest name to decide to campaign for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit and initially backing him, Mr Gove withdrew his support for Mr Johnson as Tory leader mid-contest, choosing instead to stand himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third.A former protege of Theresa May at the Home Office, Karen Bradley was handed the role of culture secretary in Mrs May's first cabinet.Her time in that job was dominated by her decision to refer Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox's takeover bid for Sky to the media and competition regulators, something that will be at the top of her successor's in-tray.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.She replaces James Brokenshire as Northern Ireland Secretary, who resigned for health reasonsDavid Gauke became the sixth justice secretary in six years - and the first solicitor to take the role - in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle.His appointment breaks a run of four consecutive non-legally qualified MPs to hold the position of the government's chief law officer.He was previously work and pensions secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury.The former City lawyer has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005. Matt Hancock was promoted to become health secretary in the wake of the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson over Brexit policy.After only a few months as culture secretary, he got the call to move up the rankings to health when Jeremy Hunt was promoted from health to foreign secretary.Mr Hancock, who was close to the former chancellor George Osborne during the David Cameron years, is a former Bank of England economist has been MP for West Suffolk since 2010.He is the first MP in modern times to win a horse race, having raced to victory at Newmarket in August 2012. And his later appearances as culture secretary included attempting to moonwalk and jumping off a wall while having a go at parkour.Greg Clark is another minister who has survived the transition from the Cameron to the May years. In his case he has been business secretary since July 2016, after a year or so looking after the local government brief.It had been widely speculated that he was to be moved in the January 2018 reshuffle to make way for Jeremy Hunt - but it did not happen after the health secretary successfully argued the case to stay put.The Middlesbrough-born former business consultant, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, started his political journey as president of the Liberal Democrat student branch at Magdalene College, Cambridge.James Brokenshire returned to the cabinet following the reshuffle prompted by Amber Rudd's resignation as home secretary.The former Northern Ireland secretary had stepped down in January due to ill health after being diagnosed with the early stages of lung cancer - but was back in Parliament a month later after ""recovering strongly"" from lung surgery.The former lawyer is a close ally of Theresa May, having served under her for five years at the Home Office.Jeremy Wright was promoted from attorney general to be the new culture secretary after Matt Hancock's promotion to health secretary in July 2018. The moves were in Theresa May's reshuffle in the wake of David Davis and Boris Johnson's Brexit resignations.A barrister specialising in criminal law, Mr Wright became an MP in 2005, serving in the whips office for the Conservatives under David Cameron from 2007 to 2012 before becoming a justice minister in 2012 and becoming attorney general in 2014.Penny Mordaunt replaced Priti Patel in this role in November 2016, after Ms Patel resigned in the wake of disclosures that she had held a series of unofficial meetings with senior Israeli figures.Ms Mordaunt was previously minister of state for disabled people at the Department of Work and Pensions.She was minister for the armed forces under David Cameron, and had been considered a contender to replace Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary.Penny Mordaunt, elected to parliament in 2010 as MP for Portsmouth North, is also known for her strong support of Brexit.Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016 - her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014.She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation, headed by controversial journalist Toby Young, which runs the free schools programme.One of 13 Scottish Conservatives to be elected to the Commons in the June 2017 snap election.Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post of Scottish Secretary when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015.In January 2015, Mr Mundell became the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet minister.The former GMTV presenter was seen as a rising star in David Cameron's government after winning her Wirral West seat in the 2010 general election.She lost the seat to Labour in 2015 but returned to Parliament in 2017 as MP for former Chancellor George Osborne's old Tatton constituency.She was promoted to deputy chief whip in the reshuffle that followed Sir Michael Fallon's resignation and two months later was promoted again, gaining a seat at the cabinet table for the first time in the department she had served in as a junior minister under Mr Cameron.Damian Hinds got an unexpected promotion when he was drafted in to replace Justine Greening, who refused a move to the Department for Work and Pensions in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle.The former management consultant was a Remain supporter and previously served as employment minister in the DWP and before that a junior Treasury minister and government whip.

2018-07-11,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180712081418/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-11,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180712081418/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"".

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Robbins said it was also ""really noticeable that he will barely spend any time in London"" - perhaps to avoid the protests. Mrs May said the visit would be an opportunity to boost trade links and strengthen co-operation on security.But she also warned Mr Trump not to ignore the ""malign behaviour"" of Russia when he meets Vladimir Putin in Helsinki next week.Mr Trump had joked earlier this week that his meeting with the Russian leader ""may be the easiest"" part of his European trip.Along with trade and security links, Downing Street said the other key areas to be discussed between the two leaders included Brexit and the Middle East.Ahead of Mr Trump's visit, Mrs May said: ""As two nations - we are safer, more prosperous and more creative when we work together and I am looking forward to this week's important discussions.""She said that when the UK leaves the European Union ""there will be no alliance more important in the years ahead"".Downing Street insisted Mrs May welcomed Mr Trump's decision to ""engage"" with the Russian leader in the Finnish capital on Monday.However No 10 also made clear that she expected him to raise issues like the Salisbury nerve agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia.Mrs May said: ""Our long term objective remains a constructive relationship with Moscow. If we are to be successful in this we must keep engaging individually and as an alliance.""That is why I welcome President Trump's forthcoming meeting with President Putin - open channels of communication between the US and Russia are key to managing the risks of confrontation.""Mr Trump will arrive in the UK with his wife Melania on Thursday afternoon, following the Nato summit.The couple will attend a dinner, hosted by Mrs May, at Blenheim Palace - the ancestral home of Sir Winston Churchill - on Thursday evening. Cabinet members, including Chancellor Philip Hammond and the new foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, as well as business leaders, will be among the guests.On Friday, Mrs May and Mr Trump will go to to watch a joint counter-terrorism exercise by British and US special forces at a military base. The pair will then travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for talks with the foreign secretary.The president and first lady will travel to Windsor on Friday afternoon to meet the Queen, before flying to Scotland to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort. This part of the visit is being considered private.The Police Federation has warned the visit will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces.Tens of thousands of people are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday - and in Glasgow on Saturday.Police forces from across the country have been asked to send officers to assist the Metropolitan Police. Smaller demonstrations are also expected to be held across the UK, including Devon, Dundee, Edinburgh, Belfast, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool.Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit."

Senior ministers Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned, saying they cannot support the proposals.Some Tory backbenchers and other Brexit campaigners are also unhappy, saying it means the UK will be too closely tied to the EU.The government has now published a White Paper giving more details of its plans.They are aimed at avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland, securing frictionless trade with the EU while also leaving the single market and customs union and regaining control of the UK's borders. The UK would accept a ""common rule book"" for trade in goods, but not services.There are also plans for what is described as an ""association agreement"", with ""joint institutional arrangements"" between the EU and the UK.The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, after the 2016 referendum in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Brexit. The two sides are negotiating outstanding issues related to its departure as well as the outline of their future relationship once a proposed transition period comes to an end, on 31 December 2020.Both are aiming for an agreement by October, to allow enough time for the UK and European parliaments to vote on what is decided. Dominic Raab, who became Brexit secretary on Monday after Mr Davis quit, told people who are ""criticising or carping"" about the plan that they needed to come up with credible alternatives of their own.The White Paper is not the final deal, as the detailed talks are yet to take place with the EU. The EU has welcomed its publication and said it will respond when it has seen the plans in detail."

The proposals, to be debated by MPs, will only see complaints from 2017 onwards investigated.But leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, said she was determined to push them through. Last autumn, Westminster allegations of harassment and bullying. The scandal claimed the ministerial careers of two cabinet ministers and elicited promises from all of the political parties that nothing like this would ever happen again. But many months later, three of the political activists who came forward to tell their stories told Radio 4's Today that hardly anything has changed, and that victims are still too scared to speak out.James Greenhalgh, who says he was assaulted by an unnamed MP when he was an intern in 2012, told the BBC he knew of someone who had gone through the same ordeal but did not feel able to come forward.He said he had no confidence in the current grievance system and ""nothing had changed"" in terms of the culture at Westminster.""My view is - almost as if when allegations came out, the tide went out and exposed the nasty rock pools. The tide has come back in and no-one is acting because they can't see it,"" he said. But Ms Leadsom said she wanted the new grievance and complaints procedures to be up and running before the start of the summer recess next week.""I am focused on reaching the point when anyone can come forward and complain about any single person they work with or interact with in the knowledge the complaint will be taken seriously,"" she said.""I'm absolutely determined that we will have resolution of this and in short order.""For me the key to this is to create and promote a culture that makes this a great place to work and is a role model for other parliaments and places round the world."""

withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA company that offers pregnant women and new parents health advice and gifts, faces a fine for illegally sharing more than a million people's personal data with the Labour Party.The UK's data watchdog intends to issue the owner of the Emma's Diary service a £140,000 penalty.It said Lifecycle Marketing had sold the data for use in the 2017 general election campaign without disclosing it might do so.The firm disputes the findings.""We were not given an opportunity to respond to the detail of the ICO's intended enforcement action prior to the report being published,"" said a spokeswoman.""As a result, details of the ICO's findings, including those being reported by the press, contain significant factual inaccuracies which we trust will be corrected.""She declined, however, to say what the errors were.It is common for political parties to buy personal information to target their campaigns, but appropriate consent must have been obtained by the providers.Labour has said that it will review its ""approach to acquiring data from third parties"" in light of the report.One legal expert said the intervention was likely to cause wider concern.""After the Obama campaigns, political parties saw the need to step up their data game, and at the time the playing field was not worked out,"" said Sam Fowles from Cornerstone Barristers.""They will certainly be worried now about whether they overstepped the mark in light of this.""The Information Commissioner's Office revealed its planned punishment in a footnote to a report about the misuse of personal data during the Brexit referendum.It said it would not normally announce its intention to impose a fine until it had completed its inquiries, but believed in this case that there was an ""overriding public interest to do so"".The ICO said that on 5 May 2017, Lifecycle Marketing has supplied 1,065,200 records to the data broker Experian Marketing Services for use by Labour.Each record included:The ICO said the Buckinghamshire-based Lifecycle Marketing had understood the data would be used by a mail campaign promoting Labour's family-friendly policies in 106 constituencies.Emma's Diary is promoted by the Royal College of General Practitioners among others, and its information packs are distributed by many GPs and midwives.The benefits of joining include tailored emails with pregnancy and breastfeeding advice, as well as discount vouchers for high street stores and gift packs including nappies, baby wipes and other similar items.A companion app also allows mothers-to-be to keep a journal of their pregnancies and make a time-lapse video of their growing bumps.The business' privacy policy stated that in return for such benefits, users permit third parties to contact them for marketing purposes.But while the policy had listed several business sectors and specific companies that might get the data, the ICO said there had been no mention of political parties.In fact, the watchdog added, the policy was only amended to do so in January 2018 after the ICO had told the company it was under investigation.This, the regulator concluded, breached the Data Protection Act's ""fairness"" requirement that organisations be transparent about how gathered personal data might be used.It added that there may also have been a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.In considering the size of its penalty, the watchdog said it had taken into account that it understood Lifecycle Marketing had not shared personal data with a political party on any other occasion, and had expected the information to be deleted after the general election vote.But it added that it was not clear how the firm could be confident that the data had indeed been permanently erased.The ICO added that it would make a final ruling after hearing back from Lifecycle Marketing, and would confirm the size of the penalty on or after 30 July.""[We] will be submitting our written representations to challenge the ICO's findings in accordance with the usual process,"" said a spokeswoman for Lifecycle Marketing in response.Experian Marketing Services said that it was aware of the ICO's concerns and would ""remain vigilant when it comes to data security and integrity"".The ICO has said it wants the UK's 11 main political parties to have their data-sharing practices audited later this year and said it also has ""outstanding enquiries with a number of data brokers"".""[In the past] there had been a much looser interpretation of the fairness principle, and it wasn't applied as tightly and rigorously as it has been in this case,"" Mr Fowles explained.""Now we see this is the direction of travel for the Information Commissioner, companies and political parties are going to have to think very carefully about what they told people when they took data from them."""

Here's what happened.With Theresa May at the Nato summit in Brussels, the PMQs ""B team"" stepped in to the breach.David Lidington, who is effectively Mrs May's second-in-command, congratulated Gareth Southgate and his England team and wished them ""the very best"", ahead of tonight's World Cup semi-final against Croatia.Then - just to get it out of the way - he had a joke at the expense of Jeremy Corbyn's stand-in Emily Thornberry, who four years ago was forced to quit the Labour front bench over what was branded a ""snobby"" tweet about a house decked out in England football flags. Mr Lidington offered to buy the shadow foreign secretary - who at the time denied the tweet was snobby and apologised for any offence caused by it - an England flag for the game.

""It takes some of us back to the 1970s, we are very pleased to have you,"" he told Kelly and Merrill Osmond.Ms Thornberry began by revealing that she would be not be watching tonight's England game because she would be representing the Labour Party at a service to commemorate the Srebrenica genocide. This was a subject close to her heart, she explained to MPs, because her father, one-time UN Assistant Secretary General Cedric Thornberry, had played a role ""in trying to prevent it"".It was the only England game she had missed, she assured MPs, before wishing the team the ""best of luck"".“What can be achieved when all the individual players work effectively as a team...” @EmilyThornberry taunts @DLidington ahead of #ENGCRO game #pmqs https://t.co/0lyRrv4v4q pic.twitter.com/z8pUtHDnoHEnd of Twitter post 2 by @BBCPoliticsShe may know ""very little about football"", she went on, but even she knew the importance of teamwork and listening to the manager.

She may have run a little aground in the sands of euro-detail, but the politics was surely correct, and as usual the pre-baked jokes were suitably biting. After this, any lingering notion that the government could rely on being bailed out by Labour votes if faced with a backbench rebellion against Chequers can be laid to rest.   David Lidington remained, as ever, a calm professional presence at the Dispatch Box, and his riposte, that Labour's Brexit policy was the best kept secret in Westminster, hit home. These exchanges got unusually detailed, but it was never really about the detail. No-one who's been out and about in Westminster in the last couple of days can be in any doubt about the jittery combination of brave faces and angry nervousness in the hearts of Tory MPs. This was about keeping those hearts a-flutter, and not in a good way. Most backbenchers stayed out of the Brexiting but the Conservative Julia Lopez put down a marker about keeping faith with the referendum, and her words gave a clue about how high feelings are running.Elsewhere, there were a couple of Conservative questions about crime - suggesting the issue is climbing up the league-table of concerns. Keep an eye on that; it could goad the new Home Secretary (and possible future PM) Sajid Javid into action.An audio download of some of the key exchanges, and what Andrew Neil and his Daily Politics guests made of the exchanges.The highlights of #pmqs with reaction from our panel @afneil @bbclaurak @IanLaveryMP @RobertBuckland for your phone, tablet or PCDownload and listen here 📻https://t.co/uWJg9ma6lsEnd of Twitter post 2 by @daily_politics"

The society said some examples were ""genuinely shocking, disturbing and criminal"".The ERS said harassment and abuse were among the barriers putting people off entering politics.A total of 266 politicians responded to the ERS survey, including 224 councillors, 26 AMs, 11 MPs and one MEP. Of them, 40 respondents said they had suffered abuse online and one AM said she had suffered racist abuse.One politician told the survey they were sent excrement through the post ""in a (very tacky) Valentine's card"".Bethan Sayed, a Plaid Cymru AM, said she had experienced racial attacks since her marriage to Cardiff International Film Festival founder Rahil Sayed, who is from India.She told BBC Radio Wales she had been sworn at and had comments about her appearance and racist abuse about her name and wedding dress on social media.""I haven't really ever experienced those things, because I've got the most [Welsh name], Bethan Jenkins, I come from the south Wales valleys, and you've never had to face those sort of racist comments before,"" she said.""I can't even imagine what people from BME backgrounds are having to go through in their every day lives if that's what I get within two or three months of getting married.""She said people needed to be educated more about what politicians actually do, as she said part of the tension stemmed from people feeling frustrated at things not changing fast enough.""People say to me 'well just put up with it', and 'get on with it', but should we really have to,"" she said.Two politicians talked about suffering sexual harassment while undertaking elected duty. One said they received ""inappropriate sexual advances by constituents during advice surgeries and during door-to-door canvassing sessions"".Another recounted that they were once ""slapped on the bottom"", and that someone had attempted to pull them under a tree and kiss them.One respondent told the survey: ""When I worked for politicians I had access to their social media, answered the phone on their behalf and opened their correspondence.""I opened an envelope with razor blades stuck to the inside.""The respondent added that a rock and a traffic cone were thrown at the politician's shop-front office window, ""shattering the glass all over my colleague"". They added that a constituent had stalked them to their home.""I have been a councillor for 14 years, I've won four elections and I've never had so much hassle or dissent as I have had in the last two years,"" Debbie Wilcox, leader of Newport council, said in evidence to the ERS.Jess Blair, director ERS Cymru, said Welsh political parties should develop a joint code of conduct on intimidating behaviour.She said: ""If you look at politics from the outside, if you are a normal person sitting at home thinking 'I could do that' and you think whether you want to be trolled on social media or whether you want to be away from your family half the week, whether you want to travel huge distances; those things are a massive barrier - more than actually standing for a political party.""The realities of public life need to be addressed."""

The motion said people claiming Universal Credit were suffering financial problems but that the government had refused to pause its expansion across the country.Opening the debate, Labour's welfare spokeswoman Margaret Greenwood said Ms McVey had ""undermined"" a ""damning"" National Audit Office report about Universal Credit, which combines several working-age benefits into a single payment and is currently being rolled out nationwide.Ms McVey defended the scheme, saying it had helped over 3.3 million people into work.She demanded an apology from Labour for ""misleading statements"" about the impact of welfare reform, its record managing the welfare system in government and a remark by Labour's John McDonnell during the  2015 general election campaign about ""lynching"" her.Last week the secretary of state said she had ""mistakenly"" told MPs the National Audit Office felt the benefit was progressing too slowly and should be rolled out faster and apologised for ""inadvertently misleading"" Parliament. But she stood by her assertion that the NAO had not been able to examine the impact of recent changes to how claimants were receiving their payments as they ""were still being felt and by definition, couldn't have been fully taken into account by the report"".In May Labour tried a similar technique on Transport Secretary Chris Grayling but its bid to fine him the cost of a railway season ticket was outvoted."
2018-07-12,Facebook faces maximum fine for data misuse,https://web.archive.org//web/20180712081418/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44785151,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK's data protection watchdog intends to fine Facebook £500,000 for data breaches - the maximum allowed.The Information Commissioner's Office said Facebook had failed to ensure another company - Cambridge Analytica - had deleted users' data.The ICO will also bring a criminal action against Cambridge Analytica's defunct parent company SCL Elections. And it has raised concerns about political parties buying personal information from ""data brokers"".Facebook said it would respond to the report ""soon"".The ICO also said another company - Aggregate IQ - which worked with the Vote Leave campaign in the run up to the EU Referendum - must stop processing UK citizens' data.The action comes 16 months after the ICO began its probe into political campaigners' use of personal data following concerns raised by whistleblower Christopher Wylie, among others.Mr Wylie, a former employee of Cambridge Analytica - a London-based political consulting firm - said his company had made unauthorised use of personal data harvested from millions of Facebook users.  The ICO found that Facebook had breached its own rules and failed to make sure that Cambridge Analytica had deleted this personal data.While Cambridge Analytica insisted it had indeed wiped the data after Facebook's erasure request in December 2015, the ICO said it had seen evidence that copies of the data had been shared with others.""This potentially brings into question the accuracy of the deletion certificates provided to Facebook,"" said an ICO spokesperson.Responding to the ICO report, Mr Wylie said: ""Months ago, I reported Facebook and Cambridge Analytica to the UK authorities.  ""Based on that evidence, Facebook is today being issued with the maximum fine allowed under British law. ""Cambridge Analytica, including possibly its directors, will be criminally prosecuted.""The ICO has also written to the UK's 11 main political parties compelling them to have their data protection practices audited.It is concerned the parties may have bought lifestyle information about members of the public from data brokers, who might have not have obtained the necessary consent.In particular, the ICO raised concern about one data broker: Emma's Diary. The firm offers medical advice to pregnant women and gift packs after babies are born.The ICO said it was concerned about how transparent the firm had been about its political activities.It said that the Labour Party had confirmed using the firm, but did not provide other details at this point beyond saying it intended to take some form of regulatory action.The service's owner Lifecycle Marketing could not be reached for comment. But it has told the Guardian that it does not agree with the ICO's findings.Looking wider, the ICO noted that Facebook had been the biggest recipient of digital advertising by political parties and campaigns to date. Yet, it said, the US firm had neither done enough to explain to its members how they were being targeted as a consequence, nor given them enough control over how their sensitive personal data was used.As a result, it said, Facebook was guilty of two breaches of the Data Protection Act.The tech firm's chief privacy officer has issued a brief response.""As we have said before, we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and take action in 2015,"" said Erin Egan.""We have been working closely with the ICO in their investigation of Cambridge Analytica, just as we have with authorities in the US and other countries. We're reviewing the report and will respond to the ICO soon.""Cambridge Analytica and its parent SCL Elections began insolvency proceedings in May.But the ICO said it was still taking legal steps to bring a criminal prosecution against the business.The basis for this would be that SCL Elections had failed to properly respond to an earlier demand that it give a US academic a copy of any personal information it held on him along with an explanation as to its source and usage.Prof David Carroll first asked for the data in January 2017, and the ICO served a related enforcement order four months later.Bearing in mind SCL Elections is now out of business, the ICO said it might consider taking action against the company's directors.""A successful prosecution may result in a conviction and an unlimited fine,"" added a spokeswoman.The ICO said it had established that the Canadian data analytics firm AggregateIQ - AIQ - had access to UK voters' personal data provided by the Brexit referendum's Vote Leave campaign.It said it was now investigating whether this information had been transferred and accessed outside the UK and whether this amounted to a breach of the data protection act.The watchdog added that it continued to investigate to what degree AIQ and SCL Elections had shared UK personal data.And it said it had served an enforcement notice forbidding AIQ from continuing to make use of a list of UK citizens' email addresses and names that it still holds.Other action includes:The ICO said it expects the next stage of its investigation to be complete by the end of October."
2018-07-12,UK to send 440 more troops to Afghanistan,https://web.archive.org//web/20180712081418/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44787636,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK is to send 440 more non-combat troops to Afghanistan, the prime minister will announce at the Brussels Nato summit.The commitment to Nato's mission in Afghanistan will take the total number of UK troops in the country to 1,090.Around half of the troops will deploy from the Welsh Guards in August and the remainder will follow by February 2019.They will help ""bring the stability and security that the Afghan people deserve,"" Theresa May said.At the height of the war, Nato had  more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone. As of last month, the number of Nato personnel stood at 16,000 from 39 countries, operating mainly from Kabul and focusing on training and assisting the army and police.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson - who wrote to Mrs May recommending more troops - said ""whenever the call comes, the UK is always one of the first to step up and support our friends and allies across the globe"".Nato asked Britain to deploy more troops a year ago. In September of last year, the US committed an extra 3,000 troops to support Afghan forces.Ahead of the summit, which begins on Wednesday, US president Donald Trump, hit out at his Nato allies for failing to spend enough on defence. ""The US is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them,"" Mr Trump tweeted.Analysis by BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale Sending another 440 British troops will make the UK the third biggest contributor to the Nato train, advise, and assist mission in Afghanistan.The extra troops will arrive later this summer and will reinforce the UK-led Kabul Security Force. It is not a return to a combat role. Its primary role is to transport international advisers safely around the capital - what British soldiers have dubbed ""Armoured Uber"".The US leader's main objection is that a number of member states have not increased their defence budgets to the target of 2% of economic output.But Mrs May said she expects ""to agree an ambitious package of measures to strengthen our deterrence and defence"" at the summit. ""And we will continue to make the case for all allies to follow the UK's example and meet the 2% pledge,"" she added.The last UK combat troops left Afghanistan in 2014 after being involved in the conflict since 2001.The additional troops will add to Britain's existing contribution to the UK-led Kabul Security Force and mentor the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces in the country's capital. ""Lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan will help keep the streets of Britain safe and this uplift signals our unwavering commitment to realising that future,"" Mr Williamson said."

However it is restoring it back to what Charles Barry had in mind.""Something that people will notice is a contrast between the clock face and the clock hands and the surrounding tower.""All four home nations are represented on the clock through shields featuring a rose, leek, shamrock and thistle.Adam Watrobski, Parliament's principal architect, described the clock as the ""crowning glory"" of the restoration, saying it reinforced the ""symbolism of the tower in its international representation of the United Kingdom"".He added: ""Using historic paint analysis and references, including Barry's original design watercolour, contemporary illustrations and archival photographs, we have recreated the original colour scheme.""

2018-07-12,The Commons library: 200 years of history,https://web.archive.org//web/20180712081418/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44699363,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe House of Commons library has played a quiet part in 200 years of British political history.Unknown to many outside Westminster, it shapes important decisions by giving MPs impartial briefings on the issues of the day - from education to Brexit.Home to hundreds of thousands of documents, the library is opening up as it celebrates its bicentennial. Penny Young, the Commons librarian, spoke to BBC News about the library's unique role.The library has experienced a somewhat inauspicious sequence of events. Founded in 1818 to house the Commons journal, it soon outgrew its original rooms and moved to bigger premises 10 years later. But this only lasted another six years before the famous fire that destroyed much of the Palace of Westminster in 1834. Thanks to some quick-thinking staff, some original Elizabethan-age petitions and records were saved by being thrown from the window, but much of the library's original collection was lost to the ages.But the devastation did create ""an opportunity to rethink the library,"" Ms Young says, and it moved into its current ""magnificent"" home in 1852.Disaster nearly struck again almost a century later when, during the war, an anti-aircraft missile came through a window and ""smashed through the floor"".The library survived relatively unscathed - although you can still see a book scorched by the bomb - whereas the House chamber ""did not get off so lightly during the war"".Ms Young stresses that, despite these dramas, perhaps the seminal moment in the library's history was its change from a reference to a research library in 1946.This is when it acquired its modern function, eventually hiring expert researchers to produce thousands of briefings for MPs.Despite being a ""sometimes frustrating place,"" Penny Young says it is these staff and their expertise which make the library a brilliant place to work. ""They are fantastically fast and they know an awful lot,"" she says. ""My favourite thing about the library is being constantly amazed at what they produce.""They are dedicated public servants, she says, and pride themselves on fulfilling their duty to be impartial. ""We tell it like it is,"" she adds, and the library enjoys high levels of trust and respect from MPs, despite sometimes publishing ""uncomfortable"" findings.There are 900 pieces of research published a year, both long investigations and quick briefs on topics of the day.The subjects the library briefs on naturally change with the times. ""If there's something really contentious going through Parliament, that will create a lot of demand,"" Ms Young says, so obviously Brexit has dominated for the past few years.But some things stay the same. MPs are always most concerned with the issues which their constituents bring to them at their weekly surgeries. ""People talk of MPs as the social worker of last resort, when people have nowhere to go,"" Ms Young says, and so they make lots of enquiries about immigration, housing, schooling and health. ""The issues that really matter to citizens,"" as Ms Young describes them.While the public can visit and engage with Westminster in a variety of ways, they almost never see the library, says Ms Young. Despite its critical role in political life, it is normally a private space. But as it celebrates its anniversary, Ms Young and her staff are opening the library up to the public.There has already been a fully-booked set of tours, with another due in later in the year. Ms Young encourages the public to follow the library on Twitter to see when tickets become available.Getting the public in is important, Ms Young says, because they pay for the library's work. So she is also celebrating online, ""We've created a film about what the library does and its history,"" she says, as well as a piece full of the personal stories of staff throughout the years.""We know that Parliament doesn't have the best of reputations,"" she says, ""so to be able to showcase a part of Parliament that is really trusted and has a real impact on what happens, I think will help the public understand what Parliament does - and believe in the institution even more, which would be great."""

""It smashes the hard-won Brexit compromise plan to pieces,"" writes London correspondent Florentin Collomp. ""The knives are out in the alleys of Westminster, where the summer promises to be hot"" for the prime minister, he warns. Philippe Bernard of the centre-left Le Monde is not so sure whether Mr Johnson's resignation means ""the beginning of the end for Theresa May... or the beginning of the end of her worries"".He says that after two years of ""futile skirmishes on Brexit, the boil has finally been lanced"" by Mrs May's shift towards keeping close ties with the EU. German commentators can't help drawing World Cup parallels, none more blatant that centre-left Spiegel Online's comparison of the prime minister to England manager Gareth Southgate.""They both want to win game after game, but the difference is that while Southgate has yet to get through the semi-finals, May's final game has already begun,"" writes correspondent Joerg Schindler.He expects hardline Tory Brexiteer MPs to see Boris Johnson's resignation as a ""signal to revolt"" against the prime minister's leadership.""It will be no consolation if Britain wins another penalty shoot-out, as EU statutes do not provide for extra time over Brexit,"" Spiegel concludes.  In Berlin's liberal Der Tagesspiegel, Albrecht Meier also predicts a ""revolt in Westminster"" after Boris Johnson's resignation, adding that ""the prime minister must fear for her job"".As for the EU negotiators in Brussels, they have ""no choice but to wait for the outcome of the political drama in London. There will not be much time left for the negotiations in Brussels... as both sides are still far from the final goal,"" he writes. Dominic Johnson, the foreign editor of the left-wing Tageszeitung, says the breach between Mrs May and the two departing ministers is ""not just about Brexit, but also about loyalty, cabinet discipline, and work ethic"". He dubs Boris Johnson a ""scatterbrain ever since he took office two years ago, while David Davis has had only four hours of talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier this year, and has played no active role since March"". Spanish papers focus on the probable delays to the talks in Brussels, Barcelona's La Vanguardia sees Mrs May ""walking a tightrope"" in the ""worst crisis of her government"". ""Brussels is still waiting for the umpteenth British proposal, while time and patience are running out,"" it warns. The EU correspondent of centre-right El Mundo says Boris Johnson's departure is no great loss to diplomacy. ""A chatterbox with exaggerated ambitions that drove nearly the world mad,"" writes Pablo R. Suanzes, who notes that the foreign secretary chose to quit ""in the week when a British citizen died of nerve-agent poisoning, and a couple of days ahead of an important Nato summit and the Trump visit"".""David Davis was almost irrelevant, but Johnson was a time bomb,"" he concludes. The Dutch centre-left daily De Volkskrant has little comfort for the prime minister, saying the ""chaos in the British cabinet is complete"". Its correspondent Patrick van IJsendoorn says the ""Brexiteers' dying dream threatens to turn into a nightmare for Theresa May"". In the eurosceptic press camp, Hungary's Magyar Idok harks back to the joke in the 1980s BBC comedy Yes Minister that Britain only joined the EU in order to thwart Franco-German co-operation, adding that this has ""come back to haunt Europe"".Its editorial says ""the British are right to object to the increased central power of Brussels"", but warns that ""some kind of free trade agreement and access to the single market will, in spite of visceral objections, be unavoidable.""Mikhail Ozerov, the London correspondent of the pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda wonders ""who the US president is going to talk to when he arrives in the next few days?"" The ""infamous, unpredictable, even scandalous"" Boris Johnson has gone, and this leaves Mrs May a ""lame duck"", he declares.As for the ""more positive foreign policy towards Russia"" that several commentators hope for, Mr Ozerov deems this ""highly unlikely, alas, given the current line-up on the British Mount Olympus"". Russia's government daily Rossiyskaya Gazeta reserves judgement on whether Moscow can now expect an easier ride from Britain, but agrees that Mrs May ""barely holds sway, and has lost control over her cabinet"" Pundit Elena Ananyeva warns the RBC business daily that the resignations do not mean that Theresa May can continue her ""tilt toward a soft Brexit"", as she still has to face a ""good many supporters of the hard option"" in her cabinet and parliamentary party. Boris Johnson's resignation is big news in the Iranian media, and the consensus across the political spectrum is that it spells trouble for Theresa May.The official Channel 1 TV news says it has ""put the British government on the brink of collapse"".The pro-reform newspaper Ebtekar says the two resignations ""have deepened divisions"" in the cabinet, and the Donya-e Eqtesad financial daily describes a ""resignation tsunami.""China's state media generally note that the resignations come at a time when, as the Xinhua news agency says, ""time is running out"" for Brexit negotiations.But some reports are more interested in what new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt's China-born wife Lucia Guo could mean for relations.Jeremy Hunt is a ""Chinese son-in law"", declares the Global Times daily, while the Guancha news site is proud to announce that the ""Chinese son-in-law has come to the rescue"".

Here is a guide to Theresa May's new top team.Philip Hammond remained chancellor of the exchequer after last June's general election, despite speculation that he would be sacked.He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary.Mr Hammond was a Remain supporter in the EU referendum and is seen as one of the leading cabinet voices for a softer version of Brexit than that advocated by Leave supporting colleagues.Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery.After becoming an MP in 2010, Sajid Javid has risen swiftly through the ranks of the Conservative Party and government to become the first home secretary from an ethnic minority background.Landing the job following Amber Rudd's resignation, the son of Pakistani immigrants left behind his role as communities secretary. Mr Javid, a former executive at Deutsche Bank, has also had brief stints as business secretary and culture secretary. He stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the 2016 leadership contest, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Jeremy Hunt became foreign secretary after Boris Johnson resigned over Brexit policy in July 2018.  It meant an end to his marathon stint as health secretary, a job he took in David Cameron's 2012 reshuffle, having previously served as culture secretary.He weathered a number of controversies including a 2015 battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes.He is thought to have resisted an attempt by Theresa May to move him to another job in her January 2018 reshuffle and succeeded in adding responsibility for social care - something previously overseen by local government - to his portfolio.Long-tipped for a promotion to the Cabinet, the Leave-supporting lawyer is a former chief of staff to both David Davis, who he replaced as Brexit secretary, and leading Brexit rebel Dominic Grieve.Has worked behind-the-scenes on Brexit legal detail for the government and is reported to be ""relaxed"" about a ""no deal"" scenario. In June 2018, he called for the UK to display more ""economic self-confidence"" in talks with Brussels.Grabbed headlines as housing minister - one of a string junior ministerial posts he has held since becoming MP for Esher and Walton in 2010 - when he suggested immigration drove up house prices.A close ally of Theresa May, the former chief whip ruffled a few Tory feathers when he was handed the role of defence secretary in November 2017, with some claiming he lacked the experience for such a vital role.He replaced Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned amid allegations over his past conduct.The appointment was Mr Williamson's first cabinet post. The MP for South Staffordshire was elected to parliament in 2010, and was previously an aide to David Cameron.One of the government's great survivors, Chris Grayling has been in the cabinet since 2012, when he was made Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, before going on to serve as Commons leader. A leading voice in the Leave campaign, he was made transport secretary by Theresa May in July 2016.He defied predictions he would be sacked or moved in Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle, after attracting criticism over rising rail fares, Southern Rail's disrupted services and rail franchising difficulties.The former BBC and Channel 4 TV producer has been MP for Epsom and Ewell, in Surrey, since 2001.A veteran right winger and ardent Brexiteer, Liam Fox was put in charge of the newly-created department for international trade by Theresa May after she became PM, with the job of forging post-Brexit trade deals with other nations.He was David Cameron's first defence secretary but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Mr Fox - who was a GP before entering politics - stood in the 2016 leadership race against Theresa May, but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Michael Gove's was a dramatic comeback in June 2017, when the prime minister brought him back into cabinet as environment secretary.That was just a year after his ministerial ambitions appeared to be over when he was sacked in the 2016 reshuffle which followed Mrs May's arrival as prime minister.Before that stint as justice secretary he had previously served as David Cameron's education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. His longtime friendship with Mr Cameron ended as he became probably the then cabinet's biggest name to decide to campaign for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit and initially backing him, Mr Gove withdrew his support for Mr Johnson as Tory leader mid-contest, choosing instead to stand himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third.A former protege of Theresa May at the Home Office, Karen Bradley was handed the role of culture secretary in Mrs May's first cabinet.Her time in that job was dominated by her decision to refer Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox's takeover bid for Sky to the media and competition regulators, something that will be at the top of her successor's in-tray.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.She replaces James Brokenshire as Northern Ireland Secretary, who resigned for health reasonsDavid Gauke became the sixth justice secretary in six years - and the first solicitor to take the role - in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle.His appointment breaks a run of four consecutive non-legally qualified MPs to hold the position of the government's chief law officer.He was previously work and pensions secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury.The former City lawyer has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005. Matt Hancock was promoted to become health secretary in the wake of the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson over Brexit policy.After only a few months as culture secretary, he got the call to move up the rankings to health when Jeremy Hunt was promoted from health to foreign secretary.Mr Hancock, who was close to the former chancellor George Osborne during the David Cameron years, is a former Bank of England economist has been MP for West Suffolk since 2010.He is the first MP in modern times to win a horse race, having raced to victory at Newmarket in August 2012.

2018-07-12,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180712081418/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-12,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180712081418/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Other protests are taking place across the UK on Friday and Saturday.The Queen greeted Mr Trump and the first lady as their motorcade arrived at Windsor Castle. The band of the Coldstream Guards played the Star-Spangled Banner and she invited the president to inspect the guard of honour.Their meeting lasted nearly an hour and was the final engagement in Mr Trump's two-day working visit to the UK.The Trumps took off from Windsor in a presidential helicopter before boarding Air Force One, which flew them to Ayrshire and a weekend stay at his Turnberry golf resort.They arrived at Prestwick Airport at 20:22 BST.Shortly after their arrival at the resort, a protester in a microlight aircraft flew over it, unfurling a banner saying ""well below par, Trump, #resist."" Mr Trump's first visit official visit to the UK as president took place in between the Nato summit in Brussels and a meeting on Monday in Helsinki with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The talks at Chequers came after the Sun published its wide-ranging interview with the president in which he was critical of the PM's Brexit plan.But standing alongside Mrs May after the meeting at her Buckinghamshire country residence, Mr Trump praised her as an ""incredible woman"" and a ""very tough negotiator"" who was ""doing a fantastic job"", and said there could be a ""great"" trade deal between the US and UK.He said: ""I read reports where that won't be possible, but I believe after speaking with the prime minister's people and representatives and trade experts it will absolutely be possible"".By Jennifer Scott, BBC NewsThousands of protesters, mainly women, have flooded the streets of central London in the first of the day's demonstrations against against Donald Trump.The crowd is full of whistles, drums and the all important pots and pans that seem to have become a symbol of this movement.Whilst the mood is jovial, their motivation is serious. Most of those I've talked to are here because of Mr Trump's immigration policies, especially after recent pictures from the Mexican border.There are also countless signs on his attitude to women.At the news conference, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship between our two nations is indispensable to the cause of liberty, justice, and peace.""He also told reporters:Mr Trump described Brexit as a ""very tough situation... between the borders and the entries into the countries and all of the things"", saying: ""The only thing I ask is that she work it out so that we can have very even trade.""Mrs May said the US was ""keen"" to do a deal with the UK, adding: ""We will do a trade deal with them and with others around the rest of the world.""She maintained the government's Brexit agreement - which has come under fire from supporters of a ""hard Brexit"" - ""delivers"" on the referendum vote.Earlier, Mr Trump said he and Mrs May had spoken for an hour-and-a-half at the black-tie dinner at Blenheim Palace on Thursday, which he attended with his wife Melania.""I think we probably never developed a better relationship than last night,"" he said.Mr Trump arrived at Chequers by helicopter after visiting the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, Berkshire.Meanwhile, Mrs Trump played bowls with the PM's husband, Philip May, at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London, where she met Chelsea Pensioners and local children and was shown how to make remembrance poppies.Downing Street said Mrs May had presented the US president with a gift of an illustrated ancestral chart of his Scottish heritage through his mother, and his wife with a bespoke perfume called the First Lady in a custom bottle.In his Sun interview, Mr Trump also said former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who disagrees with the PM on Brexit and resigned this week - would make a ""great prime minister"", adding: ""I think he's got what it takes.""At the news conference, Mr Trump said he had been responding to the Sun's question about Mr Johnson as a possible prime minister, adding: ""He has been very nice to me. He's been saying very good things about me as president."""

I thought that was very professional.""During the press conference, Mr Trump - who regularly accuses the US media of ""fake news"" over its coverage of him - also clashed with a reporter from the American NBC network, describing it as ""possibly worse than CNN"".He also refused to take a question from CNN, saying: ""CNN is fake news, I don't take questions from fake news. Let's take a question from a real network.""He then took a question from Fox News regarding his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Responding to Mr Trump's comments about The Sun, a spokesman for the newspaper said: ""We stand by our reporting and the quotes we used - including those where the president was positive about the prime minister, in both the paper and in our audio - and we're delighted that the president essentially retracted his original charge against the paper later in the press conference.""To say the president called us 'fake news' with any serious intent is, well... fake news."""
2018-07-13,Corbyn: It's not Trump's business who's PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20180714002419/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44819444,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJeremy Corbyn has criticised the US president over his endorsement of Boris Johnson as a future prime minister.Donald Trump was alongside Theresa May when he said Mr Johnson, who quit her cabinet this week, would make a ""great prime minister"".Labour leader Mr Corbyn said: ""With the greatest respect, it's not his business who the British prime minister is."" He also criticised the US president's attacks on London's mayor Sadiq Khan as ""completely unacceptable"".Mr Corbyn went on to address crowds of protesters in Trafalgar Square, telling them: ""We are asserting our right to demonstrate, our right to free speech."" He added that the demonstration's message was ""one of solidarity"": ""When we unite together with common objectives, we can all win.""Earlier on Friday Mr Trump insisted he had not criticised the prime minister in an interview with The Sun newspaper, at joint press conference with her at Chequers.After a difficult week for Mrs May, whose proposals for trade with the EU after Brexit sparked two cabinet resignations - including Mr Johnson's - Mr Trump also told the newspaper the former foreign secretary has ""got what it takes"" to lead the UK.Asked about the remarks, the president said: ""He's been very nice to me. He's been saying very good things about me as president.""I think he thinks I'm doing a great job. I am doing a great job, I can tell you, just in case you haven't noticed. ""Boris Johnson, I think, would be a great prime minister.""But Mr Corbyn said the president had exhibited ""very strange behaviour"" by rowing back on comments he had made to the Sun about the prospects of a future UK-US trade deal, having initially said the prime minister's Brexit plan would ""probably kill"" a future trade deal with the US.The Labour leader went on: ""It's a very strange thing to do, to come on a visit to another country, to meet that country's prime minister and then announce you would like to see as her successor, a person who has just resigned from her government.""Johnson resigned for the reasons he gave, that is Johnson's business, that is Theresa May's business to respond to. It really isn't anything to do with Donald Trump.""He also criticised Mr Trump's verbal attacks on Sadiq Khan, who the president said had been doing a ""terrible job"" following terrorist attacks in London. Mr Khan has said he will not rise to the ""beastly"" accusation.Mr Corbyn said: ""It is quite without precedent and quite unreasonable the way Trump treats London and treats Sadiq Khan.""He went on: ""When a terrible incident happened ... then surely you should recognise that the police and community have a job to do, and what Sadiq has sought to do is bring people together in unity to keep London together, just as happened after 7/7 all those years ago.""He added: ""Personally I don't think we should have been rolling out the red carpet for Donald Trump."""
2018-07-13,Reality Check: A UK/US trade deal?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180714002419/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44822906,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government's Brexit White Paper, published this week, asserts that the UK can create a free trade area in goods with the EU, but still forge its own trade deals around the world. But Donald Trump said in an interview with The Sun that the government's proposal for its future relationship with the EU would ""probably kill"" any US-UK free trade deal in the future. Then, in his news conference with Theresa May at Chequers, the president slightly changed his tune:""If they're going to go a certain route, I just said I hope you're going to be able to trade with the United States"", Mr Trump said.""I read reports where that won't be possible but I believe, after speaking with the prime minister's people and representatives and trade experts, it will absolutely be possible.""Well, the UK will be able to do some trade deals with other countries, but there's no question that the government's proposals will make the process more difficult. Let's look at goods first.The White Paper says the proposal on customs would ""enable the UK to set its own tariffs and vary them as it chooses, independently of the tariffs the EU applies."" In other words, according to the White Paper, the UK could have much lower tariffs with the US than the EU does (or no tariffs at all.)A tariff is a tax or duty paid on goods crossing borders.But there are some important caveats. First of all the customs proposal may well be rejected by the EU anyway. And, in any case, the biggest impediments to free trade are not tariffs, but what are known as 'non-tariff barriers' - the rules and regulations that govern all our economies.The government has proposed a common rulebook with the EU on goods and agri-food - which would in effect mean the UK signing up to a whole host of EU rules and regulations.  In her news conference with Mr Trump, Theresa May insisted that ""there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the rest of the world once we leave the European Union.""But the White Paper itself admits that ""in the context of trade negotiations, a common rulebook would limit the UK's ability to make changes to regulation…""And that in turn would make it far more difficult to do trade deals with other countries like the United States. It is often noted that the UK, as part of the EU, does not allow the import of genetically modified food, chlorine-washed chicken or nearly all types of hormone-injected meat - all of which are allowed in the United States.The US would push the UK to change these regulations in negotiations on a future trade deal, but the terms of the Brexit White Paper would not allow it if the UK wants to maintain frictionless trade with the EU.""We don't currently have border checks because the French, for example, assume the UK is enforcing EU regulations,"" says Professor Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex. ""If we changed the rules for US-imported goods after Brexit, they'd want to start putting in checks.""It's not all a one-way street of course. Kinder Eggs are a popular product in Europe but under US regulations, food sales are banned if they have ""partially or completely imbedded therein any non-nutritive object"" (such as a toy). In any case, Mr Trump's remarks about possible restrictions on free trade hardly come as a surprise, because his administration has said it before. Mr Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, speaking at the CBI conference in London last November, said it was important that any Brexit deal between the UK and the EU ""takes into account (Washington's) commercial interests and does not hinder the development of a closer US-UK relationship.""The UK should take steps, he added to ""avoid any unnecessary regulatory divergences"" with the United States.  What about the services sector, in which the UK government has proposed a much looser relationship with the EU, even though services make up roughly 80% of the UK economy?Under the terms of the White Paper (and, again, it's important to stress that the whole thing has yet to be negotiated with the EU) the UK will be able to explore free trade deals in services around the world.But most current free trade deals barely mention services, partly because reaching agreement on common rules and regulations is so difficult. The UK would like to change that, and ""push for greater liberalisation of global services."" It's not hard to see why. In 2017 the EU was the biggest market for UK services exports around the world.But services trade outside the EU grew by more than 73% between 2007 and 2017, and according to the Office for National Statistics, the largest single market for UK services exports outside the EU last year was the United States.""On the whole new technology has allowed services to trade more effectively on a global scale over the past 15 years,"" Professor Winters explains.  ""But the very fact the UK is so efficient in services makes other countries cautious about agreements on services with the UK.""So the UK is looking to the future, and there are certainly opportunities out there.  But under the terms of the Brexit White Paper, there will be limits on what it can achieve in trade deals, on goods in particular. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Look around. You go through certain areas that didn't exist 10 or 15 years ago.""Ms Wollaston also accused the president of a ""bullying approach"", with ""infantilising imagery"" of holding Theresa May's hand, saying the prime minister had shown ""great statesmanship"" in response.Another Tory MP, Anna Soubry, said the president ""diminishes the standing of the great country he is meant to lead"".Chancellor Philip Hammond was optimistic, saying the US president had been ""nodding furiously"" while Mrs May was speaking during Thursday night's dinner with Blenheim Palace and had yet to talk to her about the plans, which were published on Thursday in a White Paper.""I know she's looking forward to the opportunity to discuss with the president how we can take forward the big opportunities for increasing trade and investment between the UK and the United States that she mentioned last night during the dinner at Blenheim,"" he told reporters in Brussels, where he is attending a finance ministers' meeting.But opposition parties reacted scathingly to Mr Trump's intervention.Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry accused the President of ""childish behaviour of the worst sort"". She said she felt sorry for Mrs May, adding: ""Donald Trump ought to have listened to his mother. I am assuming that his mum told him that when you go to someone's house you do not insult the host.""Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the US president ""now chooses our leaders"".But influential Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, who opposes Mrs May's plan for post-Brexit trade with the EU, said many Conservative MPs shared his view.""The UK wants to do a trade deal with Donald Trump, and he said if you want to do a trade deal with the United States this isn't the way to do it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""That's a matter of US foreign policy.""He said it was different to when former US president Barack Obama tried to help the Remain campaign during the 2016 EU referendum campaign by saying the UK would be at the ""back of the queue"" for a trade deal with the US if left the EU.Mr Trump's predecessor had ""interfered"" in a UK election, said Mr Rees-Mogg.Another Eurosceptic Conservative MP, Nigel Evans, told the BBC the US president ""loves our country""."

The mayor was speaking as Labour MP David Lammy accused Mr Trump of being a ""racist"" who ""hates that London chose a Muslim mayor"". ""It's for President Trump to explain why he has singled me out for being responsible for these acts of terrorism, and no other mayor or no other leader,"" Mr Khan said.""I'm also quite clear that although there has been an increase in violent crime across England and Wales, including London, over the last four years, I don't think the rise in crime is because of immigration. ""It's for Trump to explain why he thinks there is a link between immigration into Europe and the rise in crime."" In an interview with The Sun, the US president hit out at immigration into Europe, describing the movement of ""millions of people"" as ""very sad"".""Take a look at the terrorism that is taking place. Look at what is going on in London. I think he [Mr Khan] has done a very bad job on terrorism"", Mr Trump said.""I think he has done a bad job on crime, if you look, all of the horrible things going on there, with all of the crime that is being brought in.""The verbal attack came after Mr Khan permitted a plan to fly a giant inflatable ""Trump baby"" near Parliament to coincide with Mr Trump's UK visit.The 20ft (6m) high blimp depicts the US leader as an angry infant wearing a nappy and clutching a mobile phone.Its appearance in central London was approved by the Greater London Authority, and Mr Khan has defended the decision, saying it was not for him to be a censor or to decide what is in good or bad taste.The pair have been feuding since Mr Khan criticised the US president as ""ill-informed"" following the London Bridge terror attack in June 2017. After the attack, Mr Khan said people should not be alarmed by visibly increased security on the streets of the capital.Mr Trump sparked a backlash when he tweeted: ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ""no reason to be alarmed!"""

I trust that the EU will engage with our proposals in the same spirit,"" he told MPs.Asked in Brussels about US President Donald Trump's claim that the British people were not getting the Brexit they voted for, Mrs May said: ""We have come to an agreement on the proposal we are putting to the European Union which absolutely delivers on the Brexit we voted for. ""They voted for us to take back control of our money, our law and our borders. That is exactly what we will do.""Leading Tory rebel Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ""There are very few signs of the prime minister's famous red lines. ""It is a pale imitation of the paper prepared by David Davis, a bad deal for Britain. It is not something I would vote for, nor is it what the British people voted for.""Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith told ministers he had ""deep misgivings"" about the White Paper.""I voted to leave not to half leave,"" he said.The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he would analyse the details with the European Parliament and member states and was ""looking forward"" to negotiations with the UK next week.We will now analyse the #Brexit White Paper w/ Member States & EP, in light of #EUCO guidelines. EU offer = ambitious FTA + effective cooperation on wide range of issues, including a strong security partnership. Looking forward to negotiations with the #UK next week.End of Twitter post  by @MichelBarnierGuy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, said he welcomed the UK's proposal for a future ""association agreement"" with the EU - an idea he has been promoting for some time.He added: ""We will analyse the White Paper in light of our priorities: citizens' rights, an operational backstop for Ireland and a deep economic relationship based on the integrity of the union and internal market.""CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said ""many of the intentions are reassuring"" but ""there are gaps in these proposals and more detail is needed on EU VAT, some services sectors and the new customs system"". ""It's vitally important UK negotiators get their heads down and work with businesses to grapple with the detail and get it right,"" she added.Federation of Small Businesses national chairman Mike Cherry said: ""With just 37 weeks before we leave the European Union, we need to see tangible and comprehensive details on these proposals and how they will impact small businesses.""Former chief executive of UK Trade and Investment Sir Andrew Cahn told the BBC the City would be hurt by the lack of a deal on financial services, stating: ""It means the City is going to have to change. It's going to have to change quite radically. ""We will clearly lose business, some business, to Europe. But I think the City will adjust and find a way forward.""Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said the White Paper was ""a fudge, which pleases no one and is politically undeliverable"".  Some MPs are already calling it a ""hard Brexit"" for services, even though, overall, the deal suggests much closer ties to the rest of the EU than many Brexiteers had desired.For the prime minister and the government it's an important step in spelling out the reality of leaving - more political freedom does, this paper suggests, come at a cost.And it is a compromise, which by its very nature, can't please everyone.Read Laura' full blogDominic Raab's first speech as Brexit Secretary was halted shortly after it had begun, as MPs shouted that they had not seen the White Paper.Mr Raab said the paper would be made available ""as soon as is practicably possible"".Former Labour minister Ben Bradshaw could be seen throwing copies of the document to MPs on his own bench.At which point, Speaker Bercow decided to suspend sitting for five minutes to give MPs time to read it.In the normal world this is really not a v big deal - but round here it matters a lot - pretty embarrassing for brand new sec of state pic.twitter.com/TX0CJPV8XHEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakLabour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Raab had ""not got off to a very good start"", adding: ""The utter shambles of the last 20 minutes that led to the suspension of the House during a statement is clear evidence of why the government is in such a mess.""Sir Keir told MPs: ""Across business communities, among trade unions and I genuinely believe across this House there is growing unity that the UK should remain economically close to the EU - and that means negotiating a comprehensive customs union with the EU27, and a single market deal with the right balance of rights and obligations tailored to the UK.""Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who, is campaigning for a referendum on the final EU deal - in contrast to his party's leadership - said the White Paper was ""totally unworkable and a bad deal for Britain"".  It sets out four areas of future co-operation:The document repeatedly acknowledges that the UK will have more barriers to trade in some areas than there are today. It sets out plans for what is described as an ""association agreement"",  with ""joint institutional arrangements"" between the EU and the UK. The paper says that the UK will end the free of movement of people, but suggests EU citizens would be allowed to come to the UK without visas to do ""paid work in limited and clearly defined circumstances"". No more detail of this was given by officials on Thursday morning, says BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, but they rejected suggestions that it could open the door to freedom of movement for workers. The paper also suggests that there could be ""reciprocal"" arrangements with the EU for the payment of certain limited benefits or social security. Again, officials denied that this would mean widespread access to the UK benefits systems for EU nationals after Brexit, says our correspondent.  Both of these elements will be subject to the upcoming negotiation. As the Chequers agreement set out on Friday, the UK would accept a ""common rule book"" for trade in goods, but not services.The government's aim is to preserve free trade in that part of the economy and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.The White Paper also proposes the setting up of a ""governing body"", made up of UK and EU ministers, and then a ""joint committee"" of officials, which would enforce the agreement. Officially, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK would come to an end. British citizens or businesses would no longer be able to take issues to the European Court of Justice - and the court would no longer be able to make judgements on UK cases. But the White Paper accepts that the European Court of Justice will be ""the interpreter of EU rules"" that the UK has agreed to follow in the ""common rule book"".  The White Paper also sets out in more detail the government's proposed customs system, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-foods, where it plans for the UK to collect some EU tariffs. The paper confirms that the UK will not seek ""mutual recognition"" in the services sector, which makes up the vast majority of the economy. A leaked version of an earlier draft of the White Paper, put together by the Brexit department under David Davis, envisaged that there would be such an arrangement.  Some MPs have already expressed concern that by pursuing a looser arrangement with the rest of the EU on services it means a ""hard Brexit"" for the majority of the economy while the goods sector stays closely tied to the single market, although technically not inside it."

2018-07-13,Trump raises questions over Brexit plans,https://web.archive.org//web/20180714002419/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44799469,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDonald Trump has raised questions about whether the UK's current Brexit plan is ""what they voted for"".The US president said ""Brexit is Brexit"" but it was turning out ""a little bit differently"" with the UK ""partially involved"" with the EU.""Maybe they're taking a little bit of a different route,"" he went on.His comments at a press conference in Brussels were made before his visit to the UK - as details of Theresa May's Brexit plan were published.Asked about his remarks, Mrs May said her plan ""absolutely delivers on the Brexit people voted for"".Mr Trump backed a Leave vote ahead of the 2016 EU referendum, when he was a US presidential candidate, and he was asked for his views at the Nato summit press conference.""It's not for me to say,"" the US president said.""I'd like to see them be able to work it out so it can go quickly, whatever they work out.""It's not the first Mr Trump has had his say on the UK's relationship with the EU:Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, had encouraged a Remain vote, warning of the consequences for trade if the UK left the EU.Mrs May is under pressure over her proposals for a future trading relationship between the UK and EU. Senior ministers Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned, saying they cannot support the proposals.Some Tory backbenchers and other Brexit campaigners are also unhappy, saying it means the UK will be too closely tied to the EU.The government has now published a White Paper giving more details of its plans.They are aimed at avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland, securing frictionless trade with the EU while also leaving the single market and customs union and regaining control of the UK's borders. The UK would accept a ""common rule book"" for trade in goods, but not services.There are also plans for what is described as an ""association agreement"", with ""joint institutional arrangements"" between the EU and the UK.The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, after the 2016 referendum in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Brexit. The two sides are negotiating outstanding issues related to its departure as well as the outline of their future relationship once a proposed transition period comes to an end, on 31 December 2020.Both are aiming for an agreement by October, to allow enough time for the UK and European parliaments to vote on what is decided. Dominic Raab, who became Brexit secretary on Monday after Mr Davis quit, told people who are ""criticising or carping"" about the plan that they needed to come up with credible alternatives of their own.The White Paper is not the final deal, as the detailed talks are yet to take place with the EU. The EU has welcomed its publication and said it will respond when it has seen the plans in detail."

Now they have it, surely they have an opinion about it?As far as official responses go, the most we got from Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, was that he and his colleagues now need time to analyse the White Paper in detail.On the one hand: fair enough. It is a very dense document.But I feel the EU is hiding behind the paper's 98 pages of Brexit tech-talk.In private, EU diplomats make no secret at all of their rejection of large chunks of the White Paper. Brussels has said since the beginning of Brexit negotiations that the UK can't pick and choose the ""best parts"" of EU membership and walk away from the rest when it leaves. Yet that's exactly how the White Paper is interpreted in EU circles.There is no way Michel Barnier will accept it as is.For Theresa May to get that ""deep and special"" access to the EU in trade terms, Brussels will certainly expect more concessions. But EU leaders are biding their time. Trying to calculate not if, but when, and how to get their criticisms across.They're very aware of the febrile political atmosphere in the UK and think if they make a quick comment or criticism of the White Paper, they'd be adding fuel to the fire.So if the EU is so keen for a soft Brexit - (of course we know, deep down, it would prefer no Brexit at all) - what concessions is Brussels prepared to make now to help shore up the prime minister's position in the political maelstrom at home?Worryingly few, is the answer if you're a fan of Theresa May or her White Paper.The EU still believes it holds pretty much all the cards in Brexit negotiations. I don't expect real whiffs of EU concessions before the last minute of the 11th hour this autumn.Can Theresa May hang on till then? And if she can, is she politically strong enough to strike a deal with Brussels and then sell it back home? Frankly, no one knows - and in the meantime, Brussels is stepping up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. Not because the EU or Downing Street wants that - they really do not - but because the time allotted under EU law for a withdrawal agreement to be agreed and signed off by both parties is fast running out. In the meantime, EU diplomats try to sound upbeat: the White Paper is a great springboard from which to re-start face-to-face Brexit negotiations, they say.Those talks begin again behind closed doors on Monday."
2018-07-13,Trump's blast,https://web.archive.org//web/20180714002419/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44816127,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWe all know what it's like. Having to play nice with the person you don't have very much in common with, because it's the right thing to do.Knowing that lots of people you DO like would be upset if you don't put on a show. Well, how about this: Having to ""play nice"" publicly with a person you don't have very much in common with, when they have said that the way you are trying to do your job doesn't really work. Add in the embarrassment if they happen to be the leader of the free world. From the moment of his election, Donald Trump was an awkward friend for Theresa May. He runs towards a fight. She does everything in public to avoid one. Well, just before they were due to appear alongside each other on UK soil he publicly, and at length, gave a ""both barrels"" verdict on her most important policy. Her approach to Brexit has been slowly, gently, incrementally, trying to carry the Ming vase across one side of the room to another on a slippery floor.To talk about being pragmatic, to smooth over the contradictions, to do whatever it takes to get to the other side, without smashing that vase (her party and the country) to bits. In walks President Trump, to call out one of the claims that Number 10 has been making of late - in essence, smashing the vase to bits. In an interview with The Sun, he shoots down the chances of a trade deal with the US if she sticks to her carefully crafted compromise Brexit plan. That matters because the government has been clinging to the idea of trade deals with countries outside the EU as one of the benefits of Brexit, and claiming that the choice in the Chequers deal to stay close to the EU doesn't exclude those opportunities. This isn't about what side anyone was on in the referendum. In fact, Remainers and Leavers unite in saying the Chequers deal can't live up to all it claims. For former Remainers, it's nuts to think that trade deals with non-EU countries can ever make up for what might be lost. For some Leavers, it's nuts to claim we can make the most of the world outside if we are still sticking to EU rules. And President Trump drives a bulldozer through the government's central claims about their compromise - that the UK would be able to get decent trade deals with the wider world, while sticking to the EU rules. A lot of this visit has been carefully choreographed, as the prime minister and the president dance around each other. But if the president really wanted to help her build support for her controversial compromise, this isn't the way to do it. "
2018-07-13,US reaction,https://web.archive.org//web/20180714002419/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44819466,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPresident Trump's comments to British newspaper The Sun are being described in the US as a ""Brexit bomb"" - but some White House correspondents are querying whether he really intended to rule out a trade deal with the UK.In the interview, Mr Trump said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if Prime Minister Theresa May's current Brexit plan went ahead. He added that Europe as a whole was ""losing its culture"" because of immigration from the Middle East and Africa.The Washington Post said Mr Trump had ""blasted"" Mrs May while praising her ""archrival"", former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson who resigned earlier this week over the Brexit plan.The newspaper quoted a US official who said there was ""no way Trump will apologise"" for what he said in the interview but added ""we also don't want to blow everything up"".Another official said President Trump had been privately critical of Mrs May ""for many months"", discussing her vulnerabilities and criticising her political acumen.White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders had told the British government about the interview in advance, ""but thought it would be somewhat more positive"", the newspaper quoted an official as saying.In a statement, Ms Sanders said: ""The President likes and respects Prime Minister May very much. As he said in his interview with The Sun she 'is a very good person' and he 'never said anything bad about her'."" The New York Times said Mr Trump had ""given Mrs May's teetering government a shove"".It said the US president's interview was a ""remarkable breach of protocol"" and, coming after his ""combative"" performance at a Nato meeting in Brussels, amounted to a ""global disruption tour unlike anything undertaken by any other recent American president"".The Politico website described Mr Trump's interview as ""one way to break up a special relationship"".It speculated that Mr Trump may have been ""wound up"" over Brexit by British politician Nigel Farage, the former UK Independence Party leader who campaigned for years for Britain to leave the EU, or that his comments may have been informed by a meeting between his security adviser John Bolton and the ERG, a group of strongly pro-Brexit Conservative Party MPs.But it said the most likely outcome was that Mrs May would suggest that she explain her Brexit plan to Mr Trump, Mr Trump will agree to listen and ""they'll both claim the story was overwritten, and then try to go about their day"".White House correspondents for Axios and the Toronto Star said The Sun had ""over-egged"" Mr Trump's comments apparently ruling out a US-UK trade deal.In a commentary for the Breitbart website, British writer James Delingpole said Mr Trump had ""dropped the mother of all Brexit bombs"" on Mrs May.It ""poured nitroglycerine on an already explosive political issue which threatens to destroy May and possibly even bring down her government"", he said.Mr Delingpole said Mr Trump had placed himself on the side of the ""Brexit resistance"" with the likes of Mr Johnson and Mr Farage and said that his ""outrageous, protocol breaching intervention"" had ""infuriated the liberal elite"".""For the majority of British people who support Brexit, this could scarcely have come at a more welcome or desperate time,"" Mr Delingpole said.Former US ambassador to the EU Anthony Gardner tweeted that it was ""unprecedented to attack ally during state visit"" and said Mr Trump was ""out of control and an embarrassment"".On CNN, Stephen Collinson also said Mr Trump had detonated a ""Brexit bomb"" and delivered an ""astonishing political knifing"" to Mrs May.It was just the latest instance of Mr Trump, ""who cosies up to foreign strongmen like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, insulting or criticising an allied leader"", Mr Collinson said.The blog Red State said it would be ""interesting to see how the Brits react to this"".The US ""would not be thrilled if such conditions were put on us after a vote of the whole country"", it said. ""How a country deals with other countries in trade is their business,"" it added.US political website The Hill also focused on Mr Trump's comments about ""millions and millions of people"" coming to Europe from the Middle East and Africa.It said they reprised ""a line that he had frequently used on the campaign trail - that Europe was being overrun by non-Europeans and was quickly becoming a shell of what it once was"".The Hill noted that migration levels to Europe had declined since 2015, when more than a million people, many fleeing the Syrian civil war and other conflicts, arrived.Fox News said Mr Trump's comments were a ""body blow"" to Mrs May's government."
2018-07-13,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180714002419/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44807561,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government has published its long-awaited Brexit White Paper. The document is 104 pages long and follows last week's Chequers agreement which set out the sort of relationship the UK wants with the EU after Brexit.The White Paper is split into four chapters: economic partnership, security, cooperation and institutional arrangements. Most of the debate surrounds the first section, the future economic relationship.So here are the key excerpts from the chapter on ""economic partnership"" and what they mean.This is a line that emerged in the Chequers statement last Friday, and it is one of the most important in this White Paper. It is the UK government's answer to the concerns expressed by businesses that rely on ""just-in-time"" manufacturing supply chains (such as car manufacturers), and to the need to avoid the reimposition of a hard border in Ireland. The White Paper proposes a free trade area for goods - but it is very close to single market membership for goods in all but name. The suggestion of a common rulebook sounds very collaborative, but it does - in effect - mean the UK agreeing to take on the EU's rules and regulations in all these areas.If the UK parliament chose not to sign up to any of those rules, the idea of frictionless trade would begin to fall apart. The other big sensitivity in this section will be the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).The White Paper says the role of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end, and it sets out detailed proposals for joint institutional arrangements to police future economic ties. But the ECJ is the ultimate legal authority on EU rules with which the UK proposes to harmonise.  There's more detail here about how the UK proposes to combine bits of its two previous customs proposals, to create an entirely new customs relationship with the EU. It would take advantage of new technologies to make trade as frictionless as possible, but it would still involve the UK collecting EU tariffs (taxes on imports) at UK borders on the EU's behalf - something which isn't done anywhere else in the world on any significant scale. The White Paper says the UK would also apply its own tariffs, and an independent trade policy, for goods intended for consumption in the UK. In other words, it would still seek to strike its own trade deals around the world, even though it would be bound by EU rules and regulations. For once, Brexiteers and the EU appear united - neither thinks the proposal has much chance of working because of its sheer complexity. Unsurprisingly the UK government disputes that, and says it wants to be at the cutting edge of global customs policy. But it's also worth noting that the White Paper says the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) would have to be phased in - which is code for saying that it wouldn't be ready by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020. The White Paper confirms that the UK will seek active participation in (if not full membership of) the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and the European Medicines Agency. The government is keen to address business demands that they only need to go through one approval mechanism to access both markets, in highly regulated parts of the economy. The EU has previously ruled out full UK membership of these agencies, and noted that it would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice if it were to sign up to their rules and regulations. The White Paper accepts that the UK would not have any voting rights in the way the agencies go about their business, and that it would have to make appropriate financial contributions to them. This is part of the pragmatic Brexit the government is now advocating, but it is not the resumption of full UK sovereignty that some leading leave campaigners had promised. The section on services confirms that the UK is seeking a looser relationship with the EU for roughly 80% of the UK economy. Financial and other services will no longer be able to take advantage of passporting, which gives them automatic access to other EU markets (the UK's Financial Conduct Authority says about 5,500 UK financial firms currently have EU passporting rights). The government has abandoned plans for a new relationship based on the concept of mutual recognition of financial regulations, partly because it had been so comprehensively rejected by the EU. But it is still seeking something more ambitious than the ""equivalence' regime"" that the EU has with most other third countries (part of the problem with that is that it can be withdrawn, by either side, with just 30 days notice). So, the UK argues that the importance of the City of London to the EU's entire financial system means a more ambitious solution needs to be found.  The trouble with a lot of these proposals though is that the EU will see them as cherry-picking from the four freedoms that underpin the single market. It has already said that the UK cannot have full access to the single market for goods and not services, especially if it is determined to end the free movement of people. The White Paper emphasises repeatedly that free movement of people will come to an end. Full details of a new immigration policy are due to be published in a separate White Paper, which has already been delayed several times. But there are hints in this document of what could be to come - it sets out proposals for a mobility framework, which is pretty standard in trade agreements. It could - among other things - ""allow citizens to travel freely, without a visa, for tourism and temporary business activity."" But some Brexiteers fear that what will eventually emerge will be free movement under another name, and they are already suspicious that this is just an opening bid from the government. The EU will certainly push for further concessions if the UK is to get anything close to the economic relationship it wants.Part of the problem for the UK is that it is asking the EU to be a little bit more flexible in the way it interprets its rules-based system. But that request is being made at a time when the EU thinks its rules are under threat from external sources like President Trump, and internal sources like governments in Italy, Hungary and Poland.

Here is a guide to Theresa May's new top team.Philip Hammond remained chancellor of the exchequer after last June's general election, despite speculation that he would be sacked.He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary.Mr Hammond was a Remain supporter in the EU referendum and is seen as one of the leading cabinet voices for a softer version of Brexit than that advocated by Leave supporting colleagues.Sometimes mocked as ""box office Phil"" for what some see as his dull delivery.After becoming an MP in 2010, Sajid Javid has risen swiftly through the ranks of the Conservative Party and government to become the first home secretary from an ethnic minority background.Landing the job following Amber Rudd's resignation, the son of Pakistani immigrants left behind his role as communities secretary. Mr Javid, a former executive at Deutsche Bank, has also had brief stints as business secretary and culture secretary. He stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the 2016 leadership contest, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM.Jeremy Hunt became foreign secretary after Boris Johnson resigned over Brexit policy in July 2018.  It meant an end to his marathon stint as health secretary, a job he took in David Cameron's 2012 reshuffle, having previously served as culture secretary.He weathered a number of controversies including a 2015 battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes.He is thought to have resisted an attempt by Theresa May to move him to another job in her January 2018 reshuffle and succeeded in adding responsibility for social care - something previously overseen by local government - to his portfolio.Long-tipped for a promotion to the Cabinet, the Leave-supporting lawyer is a former chief of staff to both David Davis, who he replaced as Brexit secretary, and leading Brexit rebel Dominic Grieve.Has worked behind-the-scenes on Brexit legal detail for the government and is reported to be ""relaxed"" about a ""no deal"" scenario. In June 2018, he called for the UK to display more ""economic self-confidence"" in talks with Brussels.Grabbed headlines as housing minister - one of a string junior ministerial posts he has held since becoming MP for Esher and Walton in 2010 - when he suggested immigration drove up house prices.A close ally of Theresa May, the former chief whip ruffled a few Tory feathers when he was handed the role of defence secretary in November 2017, with some claiming he lacked the experience for such a vital role.He replaced Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned amid allegations over his past conduct.The appointment was Mr Williamson's first cabinet post. The MP for South Staffordshire was elected to parliament in 2010, and was previously an aide to David Cameron.One of the government's great survivors, Chris Grayling has been in the cabinet since 2012, when he was made Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, before going on to serve as Commons leader. A leading voice in the Leave campaign, he was made transport secretary by Theresa May in July 2016.He defied predictions he would be sacked or moved in Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle, after attracting criticism over rising rail fares, Southern Rail's disrupted services and rail franchising difficulties.The former BBC and Channel 4 TV producer has been MP for Epsom and Ewell, in Surrey, since 2001.A veteran right winger and ardent Brexiteer, Liam Fox was put in charge of the newly-created department for international trade by Theresa May after she became PM, with the job of forging post-Brexit trade deals with other nations.He was David Cameron's first defence secretary but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas.Mr Fox - who was a GP before entering politics - stood in the 2016 leadership race against Theresa May, but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs.Michael Gove's was a dramatic comeback in June 2017, when the prime minister brought him back into cabinet as environment secretary.That was just a year after his ministerial ambitions appeared to be over when he was sacked in the 2016 reshuffle which followed Mrs May's arrival as prime minister.Before that stint as justice secretary he had previously served as David Cameron's education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. His longtime friendship with Mr Cameron ended as he became probably the then cabinet's biggest name to decide to campaign for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit and initially backing him, Mr Gove withdrew his support for Mr Johnson as Tory leader mid-contest, choosing instead to stand himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third.A former protege of Theresa May at the Home Office, Karen Bradley was handed the role of culture secretary in Mrs May's first cabinet.Her time in that job was dominated by her decision to refer Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox's takeover bid for Sky to the media and competition regulators, something that will be at the top of her successor's in-tray.She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010.She replaces James Brokenshire as Northern Ireland Secretary, who resigned for health reasonsDavid Gauke became the sixth justice secretary in six years - and the first solicitor to take the role - in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle.His appointment breaks a run of four consecutive non-legally qualified MPs to hold the position of the government's chief law officer.He was previously work and pensions secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury.The former City lawyer has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005. Matt Hancock was promoted to become health secretary in the wake of the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson over Brexit policy.After only a few months as culture secretary, he got the call to move up the rankings to health when Jeremy Hunt was promoted from health to foreign secretary.Mr Hancock, who was close to the former chancellor George Osborne during the David Cameron years, is a former Bank of England economist has been MP for West Suffolk since 2010.He is the first MP in modern times to win a horse race, having raced to victory at Newmarket in August 2012.

2018-07-13,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180714002419/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-13,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180714002419/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

That came just hours after he told The Sun Theresa May's Brexit plan could kill an agreement.Mr Trump has often spoken of his love for Scotland and its people and had been a regular visitor to the country for many years, but this is his first trip since becoming the US leader. Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell greeted Mr Trump after his Air Force One jet landed at Prestwick Airport in Scotland on Friday evening.The American president did not meet Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, however, she denied she had refused to see him.At a gay pride event in Glasgow on Saturday, she told the BBC: ""If the opportunity arises to meet the president I will do that and I'm sure if the opportunity arises in the future we will have lots to talk about, including the close and very important links between our two countries.""In democracies, it's also important to be able to focus also on where we perhaps disagree, and lots of people disagree with the policies of the Trump administration.""While Mr Trump was at Turnberry, police estimated that about 9,000 protesters walked from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh to the Meadows for a ""carnival of resistance"". The event featured the giant Trump Baby balloon, which was banned from both Turnberry and Holyrood.Tens of thousands of people - organisers claim up to 250,000 - protested in London on Friday against Mr Trump's UK visit. Demonstrators also filled George Square in Glasgow ahead of his arrival in Scotland.However, the UK government's  International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told the BBC that the anti-Trump campaigners were ""an embarrassment to themselves"".He believed that the large scale protests in London and other cities ""did not reflect the genuine good manners and hospitality of the British people"".As well as the protests in Edinburgh and at Turnberry, there were supporters of Mr Trump at London's ""Welcome Trump"" and ""Free Tommy Robinson"" processions. English right-wing activist Robison is currently serving a 13 month jail sentence for potentially prejudicing a court case.The Met Police said that there were clashes during those processions and 12 people were arrested for a range of alleged crimes, including violent disorder, assault and and public order offences.Mr Trump - whose mother was Scottish - and members of his family are spending the weekend at the hotel he bought in 2014 before departing on Sunday for the meeting with Russian leader Mr Putin in Finland the following day.The paraglider stunt, which happened shortly after Mr Trump and his entourage arrived at Turnberry, was reportedly staged by Greenpeace.Ben Stewart, a spokesman for the organisation, told the BBC: ""It wasn't dangerous at all. We let the police know about 10 or 15 minutes before that we were coming in.""We phoned them, we had someone on the police line who informed them. We thought it was important that the president actually saw a real-life protester.""There's tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of people on the streets around the UK.""The police said no arrest had been made.Police insisted they wanted to strike a balance between ""protection and public safety and the public's right to peacefully protest"".However, Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams said officers were committed to tracing the person who flew the aircraft.He added: ""There are armed assets protecting the president - both from the US Secret Service and ourselves and the Met Police, who offer a close protection function as well. ""And there's no doubt anybody who breaches security around him puts themselves in grave danger. ""On this occasion we could assess the situation and we realised there was no direct threat to the president however it's absolutely something that is very serious.""As well as playing host to one of the world's most powerful men, Turnberry was the venue for a wedding on Saturday afternoon.It is understood that the bride and groom - as well as their guests and the humanist celebrant who conducted the service - had to be security checked ahead of their big day.

Other protests are taking place across the UK on Friday and Saturday.The Queen greeted Mr Trump and the first lady as their motorcade arrived at Windsor Castle. The band of the Coldstream Guards played the Star-Spangled Banner and she invited the president to inspect the guard of honour.Their meeting lasted nearly an hour and was the final engagement in Mr Trump's two-day working visit to the UK.The Trumps took off from Windsor in a presidential helicopter before boarding Air Force One, which flew them to Ayrshire and a weekend stay at his Turnberry golf resort.They arrived at Prestwick Airport at 20:22 BST.Shortly after their arrival at the resort, a protester in a microlight aircraft flew over it, unfurling a banner saying ""well below par, Trump, #resist."" Mr Trump's first visit official visit to the UK as president took place in between the Nato summit in Brussels and a meeting on Monday in Helsinki with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The talks at Chequers came after the Sun published its wide-ranging interview with the president in which he was critical of the PM's Brexit plan.But standing alongside Mrs May after the meeting at her Buckinghamshire country residence, Mr Trump praised her as an ""incredible woman"" and a ""very tough negotiator"" who was ""doing a fantastic job"", and said there could be a ""great"" trade deal between the US and UK.He said: ""I read reports where that won't be possible, but I believe after speaking with the prime minister's people and representatives and trade experts it will absolutely be possible"".By Jennifer Scott, BBC NewsThousands of protesters, mainly women, have flooded the streets of central London in the first of the day's demonstrations against against Donald Trump.The crowd is full of whistles, drums and the all important pots and pans that seem to have become a symbol of this movement.Whilst the mood is jovial, their motivation is serious. Most of those I've talked to are here because of Mr Trump's immigration policies, especially after recent pictures from the Mexican border.There are also countless signs on his attitude to women.At the news conference, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship between our two nations is indispensable to the cause of liberty, justice, and peace.""He also told reporters:Mr Trump described Brexit as a ""very tough situation... between the borders and the entries into the countries and all of the things"", saying: ""The only thing I ask is that she work it out so that we can have very even trade.""Mrs May said the US was ""keen"" to do a deal with the UK, adding: ""We will do a trade deal with them and with others around the rest of the world.""She maintained the government's Brexit agreement - which has come under fire from supporters of a ""hard Brexit"" - ""delivers"" on the referendum vote.Earlier, Mr Trump said he and Mrs May had spoken for an hour-and-a-half at the black-tie dinner at Blenheim Palace on Thursday, which he attended with his wife Melania.""I think we probably never developed a better relationship than last night,"" he said.Mr Trump arrived at Chequers by helicopter after visiting the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, Berkshire.Meanwhile, Mrs Trump played bowls with the PM's husband, Philip May, at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London, where she met Chelsea Pensioners and local children and was shown how to make remembrance poppies.Downing Street said Mrs May had presented the US president with a gift of an illustrated ancestral chart of his Scottish heritage through his mother, and his wife with a bespoke perfume called the First Lady in a custom bottle.In his Sun interview, Mr Trump also said former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who disagrees with the PM on Brexit and resigned this week - would make a ""great prime minister"", adding: ""I think he's got what it takes.""At the news conference, Mr Trump said he had been responding to the Sun's question about Mr Johnson as a possible prime minister, adding: ""He has been very nice to me. He's been saying very good things about me as president."""
2018-07-14,Reality Check: A UK/US trade deal?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180715002910/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44822906,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government's Brexit White Paper, published this week, asserts that the UK can create a free trade area in goods with the EU, but still forge its own trade deals around the world. But Donald Trump said in an interview with The Sun that the government's proposal for its future relationship with the EU would ""probably kill"" any US-UK free trade deal in the future. Then, in his news conference with Theresa May at Chequers, the president slightly changed his tune:""If they're going to go a certain route, I just said I hope you're going to be able to trade with the United States"", Mr Trump said.""I read reports where that won't be possible but I believe, after speaking with the prime minister's people and representatives and trade experts, it will absolutely be possible.""Well, the UK will be able to do some trade deals with other countries, but there's no question that the government's proposals will make the process more difficult. Let's look at goods first.The White Paper says the proposal on customs would ""enable the UK to set its own tariffs and vary them as it chooses, independently of the tariffs the EU applies."" In other words, according to the White Paper, the UK could have much lower tariffs with the US than the EU does (or no tariffs at all.)A tariff is a tax or duty paid on goods crossing borders.But there are some important caveats. First of all the customs proposal may well be rejected by the EU anyway. And, in any case, the biggest impediments to free trade are not tariffs, but what are known as 'non-tariff barriers' - the rules and regulations that govern all our economies.The government has proposed a common rulebook with the EU on goods and agri-food - which would in effect mean the UK signing up to a whole host of EU rules and regulations.  In her news conference with Mr Trump, Theresa May insisted that ""there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the rest of the world once we leave the European Union.""But the White Paper itself admits that ""in the context of trade negotiations, a common rulebook would limit the UK's ability to make changes to regulation…""And that in turn would make it far more difficult to do trade deals with other countries like the United States. It is often noted that the UK, as part of the EU, does not allow the import of genetically modified food, chlorine-washed chicken or nearly all types of hormone-injected meat - all of which are allowed in the United States.The US would push the UK to change these regulations in negotiations on a future trade deal, but the terms of the Brexit White Paper would not allow it if the UK wants to maintain frictionless trade with the EU.""We don't currently have border checks because the French, for example, assume the UK is enforcing EU regulations,"" says Professor Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex. ""If we changed the rules for US-imported goods after Brexit, they'd want to start putting in checks.""It's not all a one-way street of course. Kinder Eggs are a popular product in Europe but under US regulations, food sales are banned if they have ""partially or completely imbedded therein any non-nutritive object"" (such as a toy). In any case, Mr Trump's remarks about possible restrictions on free trade hardly come as a surprise, because his administration has said it before. Mr Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, speaking at the CBI conference in London last November, said it was important that any Brexit deal between the UK and the EU ""takes into account (Washington's) commercial interests and does not hinder the development of a closer US-UK relationship.""The UK should take steps, he added to ""avoid any unnecessary regulatory divergences"" with the United States.  What about the services sector, in which the UK government has proposed a much looser relationship with the EU, even though services make up roughly 80% of the UK economy?Under the terms of the White Paper (and, again, it's important to stress that the whole thing has yet to be negotiated with the EU) the UK will be able to explore free trade deals in services around the world.But most current free trade deals barely mention services, partly because reaching agreement on common rules and regulations is so difficult. The UK would like to change that, and ""push for greater liberalisation of global services."" It's not hard to see why. In 2017 the EU was the biggest market for UK services exports around the world.But services trade outside the EU grew by more than 73% between 2007 and 2017, and according to the Office for National Statistics, the largest single market for UK services exports outside the EU last year was the United States.""On the whole new technology has allowed services to trade more effectively on a global scale over the past 15 years,"" Professor Winters explains.  ""But the very fact the UK is so efficient in services makes other countries cautious about agreements on services with the UK.""So the UK is looking to the future, and there are certainly opportunities out there.  But under the terms of the Brexit White Paper, there will be limits on what it can achieve in trade deals, on goods in particular. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Her sister-in-law, Rebecca Ratcliffe, said Johnson's resignation had put Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case ""at the bottom of the pile"". The Foreign Office said it is working to secure the ""outcome we all want"".Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, Dr Ratcliffe, a GP from Cwmbran, Torfaen, said Johnson developed a ""genuine concern"" for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, from Hampstead, north London, and his resignation is a ""setback"". In November, while serving as foreign secretary, Johnson was forced to apologise after contradicting the claim that the mother was on holiday in Iran when she was arrested. However, Dr Ratcliffe said progress was being made after he visited Iran and to discuss the case. ""It came a bit out of the blue. We weren't expecting it and it's a bit of a setback.,"" she said. ""Poor Nazanin has been detained for two years and this is her third foreign secretary in that time.""Jeremy Hunt was appointed foreign secretary in the wake of Johnson's departure, but the family are concerned his attention will be elsewhere. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was close to securing diplomatic protection, but the change means a decision is now not expected for several months. ""Every time there's a change in foreign secretary and anything happens in the government to destabilise things, her case just gets put to the bottom of a very long list of priorities for the foreign secretary and foreign office,"" Dr Ratcliffe added. ""It felt like we had momentum. It felt like we had a foreign secretary who was taking her very seriously and was going to try and get her out.""Nazanin gets more and more disheartened and it's like she's been forgotten.""It's a heart-breaking situation all round. Her daughter has just turned four and that's her third birthday she's had without her parents. She won't carry on like this much longer.""A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We will continue to approach our consular cases in Iran in a way that we judge is most likely to secure the outcome we all want. Therefore we will not be providing a running commentary on every twist and turn."""

I thought that was very professional.""During the press conference, Mr Trump - who regularly accuses the US media of ""fake news"" over its coverage of him - also clashed with a reporter from the American NBC network, describing it as ""possibly worse than CNN"".He also refused to take a question from CNN, saying: ""CNN is fake news, I don't take questions from fake news. Let's take a question from a real network.""He then took a question from Fox News regarding his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Responding to Mr Trump's comments about The Sun, a spokesman for the newspaper said: ""We stand by our reporting and the quotes we used - including those where the president was positive about the prime minister, in both the paper and in our audio - and we're delighted that the president essentially retracted his original charge against the paper later in the press conference.""To say the president called us 'fake news' with any serious intent is, well... fake news."""

He also criticised the US president's attacks on London's mayor Sadiq Khan as ""completely unacceptable"".Mr Corbyn went on to address crowds of protesters in Trafalgar Square, telling them: ""We are asserting our right to demonstrate, our right to free speech."" He added that the demonstration's message was ""one of solidarity"": ""When we unite together with common objectives, we can all win.""Earlier on Friday Mr Trump insisted he had not criticised the prime minister in an interview with The Sun newspaper, at joint press conference with her at Chequers.After a difficult week for Mrs May, whose proposals for trade with the EU after Brexit sparked two cabinet resignations - including Mr Johnson's - Mr Trump also told the newspaper the former foreign secretary has ""got what it takes"" to lead the UK.Asked about the remarks, the president said: ""He's been very nice to me. He's been saying very good things about me as president.""I think he thinks I'm doing a great job. I am doing a great job, I can tell you, just in case you haven't noticed. ""Boris Johnson, I think, would be a great prime minister.""But Mr Corbyn said the president had exhibited ""very strange behaviour"" by rowing back on comments he had made to the Sun about the prospects of a future UK-US trade deal, having initially said the prime minister's Brexit plan would ""probably kill"" a future trade deal with the US.The Labour leader went on: ""It's a very strange thing to do, to come on a visit to another country, to meet that country's prime minister and then announce you would like to see as her successor, a person who has just resigned from her government.""Johnson resigned for the reasons he gave, that is Johnson's business, that is Theresa May's business to respond to. It really isn't anything to do with Donald Trump.""He also criticised Mr Trump's verbal attacks on Sadiq Khan, who the president said had been doing a ""terrible job"" following terrorist attacks in London. Mr Khan has said he will not rise to the ""beastly"" accusation.Mr Corbyn said: ""It is quite without precedent and quite unreasonable the way Trump treats London and treats Sadiq Khan.""He went on: ""When a terrible incident happened ... then surely you should recognise that the police and community have a job to do, and what Sadiq has sought to do is bring people together in unity to keep London together, just as happened after 7/7 all those years ago.""He added: ""Personally I don't think we should have been rolling out the red carpet for Donald Trump."""

Look around. You go through certain areas that didn't exist 10 or 15 years ago.""Ms Wollaston also accused the president of a ""bullying approach"", with ""infantilising imagery"" of holding Theresa May's hand, saying the prime minister had shown ""great statesmanship"" in response.Another Tory MP, Anna Soubry, said the president ""diminishes the standing of the great country he is meant to lead"".Chancellor Philip Hammond was optimistic, saying the US president had been ""nodding furiously"" while Mrs May was speaking during Thursday night's dinner with Blenheim Palace and had yet to talk to her about the plans, which were published on Thursday in a White Paper.""I know she's looking forward to the opportunity to discuss with the president how we can take forward the big opportunities for increasing trade and investment between the UK and the United States that she mentioned last night during the dinner at Blenheim,"" he told reporters in Brussels, where he is attending a finance ministers' meeting.But opposition parties reacted scathingly to Mr Trump's intervention.Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry accused the President of ""childish behaviour of the worst sort"".

The mayor was speaking as Labour MP David Lammy accused Mr Trump of being a ""racist"" who ""hates that London chose a Muslim mayor"". ""It's for President Trump to explain why he has singled me out for being responsible for these acts of terrorism, and no other mayor or no other leader,"" Mr Khan said.""I'm also quite clear that although there has been an increase in violent crime across England and Wales, including London, over the last four years, I don't think the rise in crime is because of immigration. ""It's for Trump to explain why he thinks there is a link between immigration into Europe and the rise in crime."" In an interview with The Sun, the US president hit out at immigration into Europe, describing the movement of ""millions of people"" as ""very sad"".""Take a look at the terrorism that is taking place. Look at what is going on in London. I think he [Mr Khan] has done a very bad job on terrorism"", Mr Trump said.""I think he has done a bad job on crime, if you look, all of the horrible things going on there, with all of the crime that is being brought in.""The verbal attack came after Mr Khan permitted a plan to fly a giant inflatable ""Trump baby"" near Parliament to coincide with Mr Trump's UK visit.The 20ft (6m) high blimp depicts the US leader as an angry infant wearing a nappy and clutching a mobile phone.Its appearance in central London was approved by the Greater London Authority, and Mr Khan has defended the decision, saying it was not for him to be a censor or to decide what is in good or bad taste.The pair have been feuding since Mr Khan criticised the US president as ""ill-informed"" following the London Bridge terror attack in June 2017. After the attack, Mr Khan said people should not be alarmed by visibly increased security on the streets of the capital.Mr Trump sparked a backlash when he tweeted: ""At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ""no reason to be alarmed!"""

Some MPs are already calling it a ""hard Brexit"" for services, even though, overall, the deal suggests much closer ties to the rest of the EU than many Brexiteers had desired.For the prime minister and the government it's an important step in spelling out the reality of leaving - more political freedom does, this paper suggests, come at a cost.And it is a compromise, which by its very nature, can't please everyone.Read Laura' full blogDominic Raab's first speech as Brexit Secretary was halted shortly after it had begun, as MPs shouted that they had not seen the White Paper.Mr Raab said the paper would be made available ""as soon as is practicably possible"".Former Labour minister Ben Bradshaw could be seen throwing copies of the document to MPs on his own bench.At which point, Speaker Bercow decided to suspend sitting for five minutes to give MPs time to read it.In the normal world this is really not a v big deal - but round here it matters a lot - pretty embarrassing for brand new sec of state pic.twitter.com/TX0CJPV8XHEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakLabour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Raab had ""not got off to a very good start"", adding: ""The utter shambles of the last 20 minutes that led to the suspension of the House during a statement is clear evidence of why the government is in such a mess.""Sir Keir told MPs: ""Across business communities, among trade unions and I genuinely believe across this House there is growing unity that the UK should remain economically close to the EU - and that means negotiating a comprehensive customs union with the EU27, and a single market deal with the right balance of rights and obligations tailored to the UK.""Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who, is campaigning for a referendum on the final EU deal - in contrast to his party's leadership - said the White Paper was ""totally unworkable and a bad deal for Britain"".  It sets out four areas of future co-operation:The document repeatedly acknowledges that the UK will have more barriers to trade in some areas than there are today. It sets out plans for what is described as an ""association agreement"",  with ""joint institutional arrangements"" between the EU and the UK. The paper says that the UK will end the free of movement of people, but suggests EU citizens would be allowed to come to the UK without visas to do ""paid work in limited and clearly defined circumstances"". No more detail of this was given by officials on Thursday morning, says BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, but they rejected suggestions that it could open the door to freedom of movement for workers. The paper also suggests that there could be ""reciprocal"" arrangements with the EU for the payment of certain limited benefits or social security. Again, officials denied that this would mean widespread access to the UK benefits systems for EU nationals after Brexit, says our correspondent.  Both of these elements will be subject to the upcoming negotiation. As the Chequers agreement set out on Friday, the UK would accept a ""common rule book"" for trade in goods, but not services.The government's aim is to preserve free trade in that part of the economy and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.The White Paper also proposes the setting up of a ""governing body"", made up of UK and EU ministers, and then a ""joint committee"" of officials, which would enforce the agreement. Officially, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK would come to an end. British citizens or businesses would no longer be able to take issues to the European Court of Justice - and the court would no longer be able to make judgements on UK cases. But the White Paper accepts that the European Court of Justice will be ""the interpreter of EU rules"" that the UK has agreed to follow in the ""common rule book"".  The White Paper also sets out in more detail the government's proposed customs system, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-foods, where it plans for the UK to collect some EU tariffs. The paper confirms that the UK will not seek ""mutual recognition"" in the services sector, which makes up the vast majority of the economy. A leaked version of an earlier draft of the White Paper, put together by the Brexit department under David Davis, envisaged that there would be such an arrangement.  Some MPs have already expressed concern that by pursuing a looser arrangement with the rest of the EU on services it means a ""hard Brexit"" for the majority of the economy while the goods sector stays closely tied to the single market, although technically not inside it."

Now they have it, surely they have an opinion about it?As far as official responses go, the most we got from Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, was that he and his colleagues now need time to analyse the White Paper in detail.On the one hand: fair enough. It is a very dense document.But I feel the EU is hiding behind the paper's 98 pages of Brexit tech-talk.In private, EU diplomats make no secret at all of their rejection of large chunks of the White Paper. Brussels has said since the beginning of Brexit negotiations that the UK can't pick and choose the ""best parts"" of EU membership and walk away from the rest when it leaves. Yet that's exactly how the White Paper is interpreted in EU circles.There is no way Michel Barnier will accept it as is.For Theresa May to get that ""deep and special"" access to the EU in trade terms, Brussels will certainly expect more concessions. But EU leaders are biding their time. Trying to calculate not if, but when, and how to get their criticisms across.They're very aware of the febrile political atmosphere in the UK and think if they make a quick comment or criticism of the White Paper, they'd be adding fuel to the fire.So if the EU is so keen for a soft Brexit - (of course we know, deep down, it would prefer no Brexit at all) - what concessions is Brussels prepared to make now to help shore up the prime minister's position in the political maelstrom at home?Worryingly few, is the answer if you're a fan of Theresa May or her White Paper.The EU still believes it holds pretty much all the cards in Brexit negotiations. I don't expect real whiffs of EU concessions before the last minute of the 11th hour this autumn.Can Theresa May hang on till then? And if she can, is she politically strong enough to strike a deal with Brussels and then sell it back home? Frankly, no one knows - and in the meantime, Brussels is stepping up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. Not because the EU or Downing Street wants that - they really do not - but because the time allotted under EU law for a withdrawal agreement to be agreed and signed off by both parties is fast running out. In the meantime, EU diplomats try to sound upbeat: the White Paper is a great springboard from which to re-start face-to-face Brexit negotiations, they say.Those talks begin again behind closed doors on Monday."

Having to play nice with the person you don't have very much in common with, because it's the right thing to do.Knowing that lots of people you DO like would be upset if you don't put on a show. Well, how about this: Having to ""play nice"" publicly with a person you don't have very much in common with, when they have said that the way you are trying to do your job doesn't really work. Add in the embarrassment if they happen to be the leader of the free world. From the moment of his election, Donald Trump was an awkward friend for Theresa May. He runs towards a fight. She does everything in public to avoid one. Well, just before they were due to appear alongside each other on UK soil he publicly, and at length, gave a ""both barrels"" verdict on her most important policy. Her approach to Brexit has been slowly, gently, incrementally, trying to carry the Ming vase across one side of the room to another on a slippery floor.To talk about being pragmatic, to smooth over the contradictions, to do whatever it takes to get to the other side, without smashing that vase (her party and the country) to bits. In walks President Trump, to call out one of the claims that Number 10 has been making of late - in essence, smashing the vase to bits. In an interview with The Sun, he shoots down the chances of a trade deal with the US if she sticks to her carefully crafted compromise Brexit plan. That matters because the government has been clinging to the idea of trade deals with countries outside the EU as one of the benefits of Brexit, and claiming that the choice in the Chequers deal to stay close to the EU doesn't exclude those opportunities. This isn't about what side anyone was on in the referendum. In fact, Remainers and Leavers unite in saying the Chequers deal can't live up to all it claims. For former Remainers, it's nuts to think that trade deals with non-EU countries can ever make up for what might be lost. For some Leavers, it's nuts to claim we can make the most of the world outside if we are still sticking to EU rules. And President Trump drives a bulldozer through the government's central claims about their compromise - that the UK would be able to get decent trade deals with the wider world, while sticking to the EU rules. A lot of this visit has been carefully choreographed, as the prime minister and the president dance around each other. But if the president really wanted to help her build support for her controversial compromise, this isn't the way to do it. "

He added that Europe as a whole was ""losing its culture"" because of immigration from the Middle East and Africa.The Washington Post said Mr Trump had ""blasted"" Mrs May while praising her ""archrival"", former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson who resigned earlier this week over the Brexit plan.The newspaper quoted a US official who said there was ""no way Trump will apologise"" for what he said in the interview but added ""we also don't want to blow everything up"".Another official said President Trump had been privately critical of Mrs May ""for many months"", discussing her vulnerabilities and criticising her political acumen.White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders had told the British government about the interview in advance, ""but thought it would be somewhat more positive"", the newspaper quoted an official as saying.In a statement, Ms Sanders said: ""The President likes and respects Prime Minister May very much. As he said in his interview with The Sun she 'is a very good person' and he 'never said anything bad about her'."" The New York Times said Mr Trump had ""given Mrs May's teetering government a shove"".It said the US president's interview was a ""remarkable breach of protocol"" and, coming after his ""combative"" performance at a Nato meeting in Brussels, amounted to a ""global disruption tour unlike anything undertaken by any other recent American president"".The Politico website described Mr Trump's interview as ""one way to break up a special relationship"".It speculated that Mr Trump may have been ""wound up"" over Brexit by British politician Nigel Farage, the former UK Independence Party leader who campaigned for years for Britain to leave the EU, or that his comments may have been informed by a meeting between his security adviser John Bolton and the ERG, a group of strongly pro-Brexit Conservative Party MPs.But it said the most likely outcome was that Mrs May would suggest that she explain her Brexit plan to Mr Trump, Mr Trump will agree to listen and ""they'll both claim the story was overwritten, and then try to go about their day"".White House correspondents for Axios and the Toronto Star said The Sun had ""over-egged"" Mr Trump's comments apparently ruling out a US-UK trade deal.In a commentary for the Breitbart website, British writer James Delingpole said Mr Trump had ""dropped the mother of all Brexit bombs"" on Mrs May.It ""poured nitroglycerine on an already explosive political issue which threatens to destroy May and possibly even bring down her government"", he said.Mr Delingpole said Mr Trump had placed himself on the side of the ""Brexit resistance"" with the likes of Mr Johnson and Mr Farage and said that his ""outrageous, protocol breaching intervention"" had ""infuriated the liberal elite"".""For the majority of British people who support Brexit, this could scarcely have come at a more welcome or desperate time,"" Mr Delingpole said.Former US ambassador to the EU Anthony Gardner tweeted that it was ""unprecedented to attack ally during state visit"" and said Mr Trump was ""out of control and an embarrassment"".On CNN, Stephen Collinson also said Mr Trump had detonated a ""Brexit bomb"" and delivered an ""astonishing political knifing"" to Mrs May.It was just the latest instance of Mr Trump, ""who cosies up to foreign strongmen like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, insulting or criticising an allied leader"", Mr Collinson said.The blog Red State said it would be ""interesting to see how the Brits react to this"".The US ""would not be thrilled if such conditions were put on us after a vote of the whole country"", it said. ""How a country deals with other countries in trade is their business,"" it added.US political website The Hill also focused on Mr Trump's comments about ""millions and millions of people"" coming to Europe from the Middle East and Africa.It said they reprised ""a line that he had frequently used on the campaign trail - that Europe was being overrun by non-Europeans and was quickly becoming a shell of what it once was"".The Hill noted that migration levels to Europe had declined since 2015, when more than a million people, many fleeing the Syrian civil war and other conflicts, arrived.Fox News said Mr Trump's comments were a ""body blow"" to Mrs May's government."
2018-07-14,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180715002910/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44807561,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government has published its long-awaited Brexit White Paper. The document is 104 pages long and follows last week's Chequers agreement which set out the sort of relationship the UK wants with the EU after Brexit.The White Paper is split into four chapters: economic partnership, security, cooperation and institutional arrangements. Most of the debate surrounds the first section, the future economic relationship.So here are the key excerpts from the chapter on ""economic partnership"" and what they mean.This is a line that emerged in the Chequers statement last Friday, and it is one of the most important in this White Paper. It is the UK government's answer to the concerns expressed by businesses that rely on ""just-in-time"" manufacturing supply chains (such as car manufacturers), and to the need to avoid the reimposition of a hard border in Ireland. The White Paper proposes a free trade area for goods - but it is very close to single market membership for goods in all but name. The suggestion of a common rulebook sounds very collaborative, but it does - in effect - mean the UK agreeing to take on the EU's rules and regulations in all these areas.If the UK parliament chose not to sign up to any of those rules, the idea of frictionless trade would begin to fall apart. The other big sensitivity in this section will be the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).The White Paper says the role of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end, and it sets out detailed proposals for joint institutional arrangements to police future economic ties. But the ECJ is the ultimate legal authority on EU rules with which the UK proposes to harmonise.  There's more detail here about how the UK proposes to combine bits of its two previous customs proposals, to create an entirely new customs relationship with the EU. It would take advantage of new technologies to make trade as frictionless as possible, but it would still involve the UK collecting EU tariffs (taxes on imports) at UK borders on the EU's behalf - something which isn't done anywhere else in the world on any significant scale. The White Paper says the UK would also apply its own tariffs, and an independent trade policy, for goods intended for consumption in the UK. In other words, it would still seek to strike its own trade deals around the world, even though it would be bound by EU rules and regulations. For once, Brexiteers and the EU appear united - neither thinks the proposal has much chance of working because of its sheer complexity. Unsurprisingly the UK government disputes that, and says it wants to be at the cutting edge of global customs policy. But it's also worth noting that the White Paper says the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) would have to be phased in - which is code for saying that it wouldn't be ready by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020. The White Paper confirms that the UK will seek active participation in (if not full membership of) the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and the European Medicines Agency. The government is keen to address business demands that they only need to go through one approval mechanism to access both markets, in highly regulated parts of the economy. The EU has previously ruled out full UK membership of these agencies, and noted that it would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice if it were to sign up to their rules and regulations. The White Paper accepts that the UK would not have any voting rights in the way the agencies go about their business, and that it would have to make appropriate financial contributions to them. This is part of the pragmatic Brexit the government is now advocating, but it is not the resumption of full UK sovereignty that some leading leave campaigners had promised. The section on services confirms that the UK is seeking a looser relationship with the EU for roughly 80% of the UK economy. Financial and other services will no longer be able to take advantage of passporting, which gives them automatic access to other EU markets (the UK's Financial Conduct Authority says about 5,500 UK financial firms currently have EU passporting rights). The government has abandoned plans for a new relationship based on the concept of mutual recognition of financial regulations, partly because it had been so comprehensively rejected by the EU. But it is still seeking something more ambitious than the ""equivalence' regime"" that the EU has with most other third countries (part of the problem with that is that it can be withdrawn, by either side, with just 30 days notice). So, the UK argues that the importance of the City of London to the EU's entire financial system means a more ambitious solution needs to be found.  The trouble with a lot of these proposals though is that the EU will see them as cherry-picking from the four freedoms that underpin the single market. It has already said that the UK cannot have full access to the single market for goods and not services, especially if it is determined to end the free movement of people. The White Paper emphasises repeatedly that free movement of people will come to an end. Full details of a new immigration policy are due to be published in a separate White Paper, which has already been delayed several times. But there are hints in this document of what could be to come - it sets out proposals for a mobility framework, which is pretty standard in trade agreements. It could - among other things - ""allow citizens to travel freely, without a visa, for tourism and temporary business activity."" But some Brexiteers fear that what will eventually emerge will be free movement under another name, and they are already suspicious that this is just an opening bid from the government. The EU will certainly push for further concessions if the UK is to get anything close to the economic relationship it wants.Part of the problem for the UK is that it is asking the EU to be a little bit more flexible in the way it interprets its rules-based system. But that request is being made at a time when the EU thinks its rules are under threat from external sources like President Trump, and internal sources like governments in Italy, Hungary and Poland.

2018-07-14,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180715002910/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-14,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180715002910/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

2018-07-15,Theresa May: Trump told me to sue the EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20180715234053/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44838028,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDonald Trump told Theresa May she should sue the EU rather than negotiate over Brexit, she has told the BBC.The US president said on Friday at a joint news conference he had given Mrs May a suggestion - but she had found it too ""brutal"".Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr what he had said, she replied: ""He told me I should sue the EU - not go into negotiations.""It came as another government member resigned over her Brexit plans.Robert Courts said he quit as a parliamentary private secretary - an unpaid ministerial aide - at the Foreign Office to ""express discontent"" with Mrs May's policy before key Brexit votes on Monday.""I had to think who I wanted to see in the mirror for the rest of my life,"" he said in tweet. He could not tell his constituents he supported Mrs May's proposals ""in their current form,"" he added.Mr Courts replaced David Cameron as the Conservative MP for Witney, Oxfordshire in 2016.Defending her Brexit blueprint on the Andrew Marr show, the prime minister said it would allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations, end free movement of people, and end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.A White Paper published on Thursday fleshed out details of her plan, which advocates close links with the EU on trade in goods, but not services.Before the paper was published, Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson resigned, along with several junior government figures, saying it would not deliver the Brexit people voted for in the 2016 referendum.Mrs May laughed off the president's legal action suggestion, but added: ""Interestingly, what the president also said at that press conference was 'don't walk away'. ""Don't walk away from those negotiations because then you'll be stuck. So I want us to be able to sit down to negotiate the best deal for Britain.""Donald Trump declined to spell out what his advice to Mrs May had been, in an interview with US TV network CBS, but added: ""Maybe she'll take it, it's something she could do if she wanted to. ""But it was strong advice. And I think it probably would have worked.""Ahead of his meeting with Mrs May, Mr Trump told the Sun newspaper her Brexit proposals would ""probably kill"" a trade deal with his country.But hours later he said a US-UK trade deal would ""absolutely be possible"".Leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has called the White Paper a ""bad deal for Britain"".He told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""The government unfortunately believes that Brexit is not a good thing in itself, it seems to think it has to be tempered by non-Brexit.""He said Mrs May, who campaigned to keep Britain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, had failed to grasp the ""enormously positive"" opportunities offered.He described her as a ""Remainer who has remained a Remainer"".He also said she would have to change her policy in order to get it through Parliament, without having to rely on Labour votes.Mrs May urged Brexiteers in her own party to ""keep their eye on the prize"" of Brexit - and said her plan was the only workable way to deliver it.Analysis by BBC legal correspondent Clive ColemanFrankly, it is difficult to see any grounds for the UK suing the EU.Like any other member state, the UK can sue the EU in relation to any specific measure it has taken which breaches EU law.  Such action would be heard at the European Court of Justice, the ultimate arbiter of EU law.  An example would be if the UK was denied agricultural subsidies, or structural funds to which it was entitled under EU law.  The Conservative government of David Cameron successfully sued when the European Central Bank said it would only license financial institutions within the Eurozone as clearing houses for transactions in euros. The UK and the EU have not reached a Brexit agreement yet, so there can be no action for breach of that agreement.Parties to a negotiation are under what are known as ""procedural duties"" - for instance, to act in good faith.  But it is very difficult to bring an action, within a negotiation, on that basis. Some would say that even attempting to do so would seriously harm the negotiation.Mrs May's message comes ahead of crucial Commons votes on trade and customs policy in the coming week, with Tory Brexiteers tabling a series of amendments to the legislation.Mr Rees-Mogg said he was not expecting either the Customs Bill or the Trade Bill to be voted down at this stage. There are also likely to be amendments tabled by Remain supporting MPs.Mrs May told Andrew Marr: ""Some people are saying they want to vote in the Trade Bill to keep us in the customs union. I say that's not acceptable, that's not what the British people voted for. ""Others are saying that perhaps we cannot have the bill at all. That would be damaging to our 'no deal' preparations. ""So let's just keep our eyes on the prize here. The prize is delivering leaving the European Union in a way that's in our national interest.""Mrs May insists her plans would allow the UK to strike its own trade deals, despite agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU on cross-border trade.She said such rules were needed to protect jobs in firms with supply chains that crossed borders and deal with the Irish border issue.Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said Mrs May's ""so-called plan"" did not ""stand up to scrutiny"".""No-one - not the public, Parliament or the Conservative party - is happy with Theresa May's offer. This has descended into a shambles,"" he said.Labour MP Ian Murray, a member of the People's Vote campaign, said the British people needed a vote on the final deal.Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson said it was not the party's policy to back another referendum - but said it should not be ruled out."

The US president is expected to fly from Prestwick Airport to Finland where he will prepare for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has been staying at his Turnberry resort on the Ayrshire coast during the private leg of his UK visit.Protesters gathered around the perimeter of the course as he played golf on Saturday afternoon. Amid tight security, he waved as they heckled him from a hill overlooking the Ailsa championship course. Meanwhile, Police Scotland confirmed they were investigating how a paraglider criticising Mr Trump was able to fly over Turnberry, breaching an air exclusion zone. In Edinburgh thousands of people marched through the city in a demonstration against the president's controversial visit to the UK. They waved placards as they gathered in the capital's Meadows, where two giant nappy-clad baby Trump balloons were inflated. In a tweet on Saturday, Mr Trump said he was at Turnberry ""for two days of meetings, calls and hopefully some golf"". ""The weather is beautiful and this place is incredible,"" he added. ""Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin.""I have arrived in Scotland and will be at Trump Turnberry for two days of meetings, calls and hopefully, some golf - my primary form of exercise! The weather is beautiful, and this place is incredible! Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin.End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpThere have been calls for Monday's meeting between the US and Russian presidents to be cancelled, after the US charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with election interference. But White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has said the meeting will go ahead as planned in Helsinki. And Mr Trump used Twitter to criticise the administration of his predecessor Barack Obama over alleged Russian hacking to help him win the 2016 presidential election.""Why didn't they do something about it?"" he tweeted, adding that Mr Obama had been told about it before the vote.Police estimated that about 9,000 people took part in the march through Edinburgh, which they said ""passed without incident"". They gathered at the Scottish Parliament, before walking to the city's meadows area for a ""carnival of resistance"". At Turnberry, protesters climbed a hill near the golf course to ensure the president could see their placards and banners. As he took to the golf course with his son, Eric, they branded him a ""racist"", shouting: ""No Trump, no KKK, no racist USA.""The president and his wife Melania arrived in Scotland on board Air Force One on Friday evening, before travelling by motorcade to the Trump Turnberry resort - one of two Scottish golf courses he owns.There is a massive security operation in place at the complex on the Ayrshire coast but shortly after he arrived a paraglider flew over the area with a sign claiming Mr Trump was ""well below par"". Police Scotland said the person responsible for the serious security breach put themselves in ""grave danger"". It comes after the president spent Friday meeting both Theresa May and the Queen on what is Mr Trump's first visit to the UK as president.Supporters of Mr Trump gathered in London on Saturday, the day after an estimated 100,000-plus rallied through London in opposition to the US president."

The programme will be broadcast at 09:00 BST on BBC One. "
2018-07-15,Brexit circles over air show extravaganza,https://web.archive.org//web/20180715234053/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44824336,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe weather forecast may be warm and sunny, but there is still likely to be a cloud hanging over the Farnborough Airshow this week.The show is big event of the year for the aerospace industry. It's where the latest multi-billion-dollar fighters and sleek airliners soar through the skies.However, on trade days - which kick-off the show before Farnborough opens its door to the general public - the air display itself is merely a distraction.The show attracts about 100,000 trade visitors from 100 countries. The focus is on networking and doing deals - at the last Farnborough Airshow, in 2016, those deals were worth $124bn (£95bn).For aerospace companies in Britain, the event is a vital shop window. But this year fears about the future after Brexit are looming, and for many people will dominate gossip in the plush chalets and meeting rooms. Paul Everitt is head of ADS Group, which represents the UK aerospace, defence and space sectors. He insists that any failure to agree a good deal on Brexit will hurt the sector.""If the costs of operating in the UK become higher, then our ability to attract new investment will be diminished"", he says.The current uncertainty is already taking its toll, he thinks.""We are a long term industry. When a big investment decision comes along we are not in such a good place. If it continues we could see an erosion of our position.""ADS has welcomed the government's White Paper, published on Thursday, which it says represents good progress; but it insists there are important and complex issues still to be Such concern isn't just being felt among the big players. Many of the smaller suppliers which throng the exhibition halls at Farnborough will also be wondering what the future will bring. The government, however, may go some way to answering such questions this week. On Monday, a major announcement is expected from the Ministry of Defence, setting out details of its Combat Air Strategy. It is expected to explain its plans for developing and building new fighter aircraft from the 2020s onwards - when production of the Eurofighter Typhoon is likely to be wound down - and protecting the capabilities of the UK defence sector. There may also be an announcement from the government on which of eight possible sites will become home to the UK's first spaceport. The ambition for the spaceport is that it becomes a hub for the UK commercialism of the space sector, through such things as satellite launches and tourism.There is also talk that the UK may use Farnborough to unveil research funding for aerospace technologies, including for electric-powered aviation projects.Brexit aside though, the commercial aviation industry seems to be in rude health. Both Boeing and Airbus already have very full order books, and demand is unlikely to slacken. Forecasts published in recent days, by Airbus itself and by the aviation intelligence group FlightGlobal, suggest that the aircraft fleet will more or less double over the next two decades - driven largely by rising demand in the Asia-Pacific region.At Farnborough, orders could be placed for up to 900 new aircraft, according to analysts at the aviation consultancy IBA Group. The majority will be for variants of the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737 MAX. Nevertheless, the smaller end of the market is likely to be generating more interest than usual. Airbus recently took a majority stake in Bombardier's C-series programme, rescuing the Canadian manufacturer from financial turmoil. Boeing responded by agreeing a preliminary deal to take control of rival Embraer's commercial jet programme - although it has yet to be finalised. Both will have their new toys on display at the show. Airbus has rechristened the C-series as the Airbus A220 and painted it in corporate colours. Embraer, meanwhile, will be showing off its E-190 E2, a similar, highly-efficient regional airliner, which entered into service earlier this year. Orders for the two aircraft types have been sluggish - but with the marketing clout of the aerospace giants behind them, that could change. Elsewhere at Farnborough, there will be plenty of talk about the future.Concorde may have stopped flying in 2003, but several companies now have ambitious plans for a successor.Last month, Boeing unveiled its vision for a ""hypersonic"" airliner capable of flying at five times the speed of sound. That concept is expected to form part of an elaborate exhibit at Farnborough dedicated to how the industry will change in years to come. Denver-based Boom Supersonic will also be present. The company is working on a small supersonic aircraft, which it plans to begin flying next year. Boom hopes to have a 55-seat aircraft carrying passengers across the Atlantic by the mid-2020s. Its chief executive, Blake Scholl, will be among the keynote speakers at a conference taking place during the show.Autonomous aircraft and urban air taxis, cybersecurity and advanced manufacturing are other issues which are likely to be the subject of animated conversations. An entire pavilion has been set aside to show off innovative technologies, under the catchy title of Aerospace 4.0.The US defence industry will be out in force at the show. The Trump administration is not merely keen for NATO members to spend more on their military; it also wants them to buy American weapons. ""Even with the NATO debacle, Eastern European countries are increasingly willing to buy US hardware"", says Francis Tusa, editor of Defence Analysis.""In part it's because of the implicit security guarantees from the US that it brings. And these are some of the countries that are raising their defence budgets the fastest,"" he said.So for a few days, a relatively quiet airfield in Hampshire will become the beating heart of the global aerospace industry. And as the fighters scream through the air, businesses will be seeking orders that will send money pouring into their coffers. "
2018-07-15,Reality Check: A UK/US trade deal?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180715234053/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44822906,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government's Brexit White Paper, published this week, asserts that the UK can create a free trade area in goods with the EU, but still forge its own trade deals around the world. But Donald Trump said in an interview with The Sun that the government's proposal for its future relationship with the EU would ""probably kill"" any US-UK free trade deal in the future. Then, in his news conference with Theresa May at Chequers, the president slightly changed his tune:""If they're going to go a certain route, I just said I hope you're going to be able to trade with the United States"", Mr Trump said.""I read reports where that won't be possible but I believe, after speaking with the prime minister's people and representatives and trade experts, it will absolutely be possible.""Well, the UK will be able to do some trade deals with other countries, but there's no question that the government's proposals will make the process more difficult. Let's look at goods first.The White Paper says the proposal on customs would ""enable the UK to set its own tariffs and vary them as it chooses, independently of the tariffs the EU applies."" In other words, according to the White Paper, the UK could have much lower tariffs with the US than the EU does (or no tariffs at all.)A tariff is a tax or duty paid on goods crossing borders.But there are some important caveats. First of all the customs proposal may well be rejected by the EU anyway. And, in any case, the biggest impediments to free trade are not tariffs, but what are known as 'non-tariff barriers' - the rules and regulations that govern all our economies.The government has proposed a common rulebook with the EU on goods and agri-food - which would in effect mean the UK signing up to a whole host of EU rules and regulations.  In her news conference with Mr Trump, Theresa May insisted that ""there will be no limit to the possibility of us doing trade deals around the rest of the world once we leave the European Union.""But the White Paper itself admits that ""in the context of trade negotiations, a common rulebook would limit the UK's ability to make changes to regulation…""And that in turn would make it far more difficult to do trade deals with other countries like the United States. It is often noted that the UK, as part of the EU, does not allow the import of genetically modified food, chlorine-washed chicken or nearly all types of hormone-injected meat - all of which are allowed in the United States.The US would push the UK to change these regulations in negotiations on a future trade deal, but the terms of the Brexit White Paper would not allow it if the UK wants to maintain frictionless trade with the EU.""We don't currently have border checks because the French, for example, assume the UK is enforcing EU regulations,"" says Professor Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex. ""If we changed the rules for US-imported goods after Brexit, they'd want to start putting in checks.""It's not all a one-way street of course. Kinder Eggs are a popular product in Europe but under US regulations, food sales are banned if they have ""partially or completely imbedded therein any non-nutritive object"" (such as a toy). In any case, Mr Trump's remarks about possible restrictions on free trade hardly come as a surprise, because his administration has said it before. Mr Trump's Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, speaking at the CBI conference in London last November, said it was important that any Brexit deal between the UK and the EU ""takes into account (Washington's) commercial interests and does not hinder the development of a closer US-UK relationship.""The UK should take steps, he added to ""avoid any unnecessary regulatory divergences"" with the United States.  What about the services sector, in which the UK government has proposed a much looser relationship with the EU, even though services make up roughly 80% of the UK economy?Under the terms of the White Paper (and, again, it's important to stress that the whole thing has yet to be negotiated with the EU) the UK will be able to explore free trade deals in services around the world.But most current free trade deals barely mention services, partly because reaching agreement on common rules and regulations is so difficult. The UK would like to change that, and ""push for greater liberalisation of global services."" It's not hard to see why. In 2017 the EU was the biggest market for UK services exports around the world.But services trade outside the EU grew by more than 73% between 2007 and 2017, and according to the Office for National Statistics, the largest single market for UK services exports outside the EU last year was the United States.""On the whole new technology has allowed services to trade more effectively on a global scale over the past 15 years,"" Professor Winters explains.  ""But the very fact the UK is so efficient in services makes other countries cautious about agreements on services with the UK.""So the UK is looking to the future, and there are certainly opportunities out there.  But under the terms of the Brexit White Paper, there will be limits on what it can achieve in trade deals, on goods in particular. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Other protests are taking place across the UK on Friday and Saturday.The Queen greeted Mr Trump and the first lady as their motorcade arrived at Windsor Castle. The band of the Coldstream Guards played the Star-Spangled Banner and she invited the president to inspect the guard of honour.Their meeting lasted nearly an hour and was the final engagement in Mr Trump's two-day working visit to the UK.The Trumps took off from Windsor in a presidential helicopter before boarding Air Force One, which flew them to Ayrshire and a weekend stay at his Turnberry golf resort.They arrived at Prestwick Airport at 20:22 BST.Shortly after their arrival at the resort, a protester in a microlight aircraft flew over it, unfurling a banner saying ""well below par, Trump, #resist."" Mr Trump's first visit official visit to the UK as president took place in between the Nato summit in Brussels and a meeting on Monday in Helsinki with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The talks at Chequers came after the Sun published its wide-ranging interview with the president in which he was critical of the PM's Brexit plan.But standing alongside Mrs May after the meeting at her Buckinghamshire country residence, Mr Trump praised her as an ""incredible woman"" and a ""very tough negotiator"" who was ""doing a fantastic job"", and said there could be a ""great"" trade deal between the US and UK.He said: ""I read reports where that won't be possible, but I believe after speaking with the prime minister's people and representatives and trade experts it will absolutely be possible"".By Jennifer Scott, BBC NewsThousands of protesters, mainly women, have flooded the streets of central London in the first of the day's demonstrations against against Donald Trump.The crowd is full of whistles, drums and the all important pots and pans that seem to have become a symbol of this movement.Whilst the mood is jovial, their motivation is serious. Most of those I've talked to are here because of Mr Trump's immigration policies, especially after recent pictures from the Mexican border.There are also countless signs on his attitude to women.At the news conference, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship between our two nations is indispensable to the cause of liberty, justice, and peace.""He also told reporters:Mr Trump described Brexit as a ""very tough situation... between the borders and the entries into the countries and all of the things"", saying: ""The only thing I ask is that she work it out so that we can have very even trade.""Mrs May said the US was ""keen"" to do a deal with the UK, adding: ""We will do a trade deal with them and with others around the rest of the world.""She maintained the government's Brexit agreement - which has come under fire from supporters of a ""hard Brexit"" - ""delivers"" on the referendum vote.Earlier, Mr Trump said he and Mrs May had spoken for an hour-and-a-half at the black-tie dinner at Blenheim Palace on Thursday, which he attended with his wife Melania.""I think we probably never developed a better relationship than last night,"" he said.Mr Trump arrived at Chequers by helicopter after visiting the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, Berkshire.Meanwhile, Mrs Trump played bowls with the PM's husband, Philip May, at the Royal Hospital Chelsea in London, where she met Chelsea Pensioners and local children and was shown how to make remembrance poppies.Downing Street said Mrs May had presented the US president with a gift of an illustrated ancestral chart of his Scottish heritage through his mother, and his wife with a bespoke perfume called the First Lady in a custom bottle.In his Sun interview, Mr Trump also said former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who disagrees with the PM on Brexit and resigned this week - would make a ""great prime minister"", adding: ""I think he's got what it takes.""At the news conference, Mr Trump said he had been responding to the Sun's question about Mr Johnson as a possible prime minister, adding: ""He has been very nice to me. He's been saying very good things about me as president."""

Her sister-in-law, Rebecca Ratcliffe, said Johnson's resignation had put Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's case ""at the bottom of the pile"". The Foreign Office said it is working to secure the ""outcome we all want"".Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, Dr Ratcliffe, a GP from Cwmbran, Torfaen, said Johnson developed a ""genuine concern"" for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, from Hampstead, north London, and his resignation is a ""setback"". In November, while serving as foreign secretary, Johnson was forced to apologise after contradicting the claim that the mother was on holiday in Iran when she was arrested. However, Dr Ratcliffe said progress was being made after he visited Iran and to discuss the case. ""It came a bit out of the blue. We weren't expecting it and it's a bit of a setback.,"" she said. ""Poor Nazanin has been detained for two years and this is her third foreign secretary in that time.""Jeremy Hunt was appointed foreign secretary in the wake of Johnson's departure, but the family are concerned his attention will be elsewhere. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was close to securing diplomatic protection, but the change means a decision is now not expected for several months. ""Every time there's a change in foreign secretary and anything happens in the government to destabilise things, her case just gets put to the bottom of a very long list of priorities for the foreign secretary and foreign office,"" Dr Ratcliffe added. ""It felt like we had momentum. It felt like we had a foreign secretary who was taking her very seriously and was going to try and get her out.""Nazanin gets more and more disheartened and it's like she's been forgotten.""It's a heart-breaking situation all round. Her daughter has just turned four and that's her third birthday she's had without her parents. She won't carry on like this much longer.""A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We will continue to approach our consular cases in Iran in a way that we judge is most likely to secure the outcome we all want. Therefore we will not be providing a running commentary on every twist and turn."""

I thought that was very professional.""During the press conference, Mr Trump - who regularly accuses the US media of ""fake news"" over its coverage of him - also clashed with a reporter from the American NBC network, describing it as ""possibly worse than CNN"".He also refused to take a question from CNN, saying: ""CNN is fake news, I don't take questions from fake news. Let's take a question from a real network.""He then took a question from Fox News regarding his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Responding to Mr Trump's comments about The Sun, a spokesman for the newspaper said: ""We stand by our reporting and the quotes we used - including those where the president was positive about the prime minister, in both the paper and in our audio - and we're delighted that the president essentially retracted his original charge against the paper later in the press conference.""To say the president called us 'fake news' with any serious intent is, well... fake news."""

He also criticised the US president's attacks on London's mayor Sadiq Khan as ""completely unacceptable"".Mr Corbyn went on to address crowds of protesters in Trafalgar Square, telling them: ""We are asserting our right to demonstrate, our right to free speech."" He added that the demonstration's message was ""one of solidarity"": ""When we unite together with common objectives, we can all win.""Earlier on Friday Mr Trump insisted he had not criticised the prime minister in an interview with The Sun newspaper, at joint press conference with her at Chequers.After a difficult week for Mrs May, whose proposals for trade with the EU after Brexit sparked two cabinet resignations - including Mr Johnson's - Mr Trump also told the newspaper the former foreign secretary has ""got what it takes"" to lead the UK.Asked about the remarks, the president said: ""He's been very nice to me. He's been saying very good things about me as president.""I think he thinks I'm doing a great job. I am doing a great job, I can tell you, just in case you haven't noticed. ""Boris Johnson, I think, would be a great prime minister.""But Mr Corbyn said the president had exhibited ""very strange behaviour"" by rowing back on comments he had made to the Sun about the prospects of a future UK-US trade deal, having initially said the prime minister's Brexit plan would ""probably kill"" a future trade deal with the US.The Labour leader went on: ""It's a very strange thing to do, to come on a visit to another country, to meet that country's prime minister and then announce you would like to see as her successor, a person who has just resigned from her government.""Johnson resigned for the reasons he gave, that is Johnson's business, that is Theresa May's business to respond to. It really isn't anything to do with Donald Trump.""He also criticised Mr Trump's verbal attacks on Sadiq Khan, who the president said had been doing a ""terrible job"" following terrorist attacks in London. Mr Khan has said he will not rise to the ""beastly"" accusation.Mr Corbyn said: ""It is quite without precedent and quite unreasonable the way Trump treats London and treats Sadiq Khan.""He went on: ""When a terrible incident happened ... then surely you should recognise that the police and community have a job to do, and what Sadiq has sought to do is bring people together in unity to keep London together, just as happened after 7/7 all those years ago.""He added: ""Personally I don't think we should have been rolling out the red carpet for Donald Trump."""

Now they have it, surely they have an opinion about it?As far as official responses go, the most we got from Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, was that he and his colleagues now need time to analyse the White Paper in detail.On the one hand: fair enough. It is a very dense document.But I feel the EU is hiding behind the paper's 98 pages of Brexit tech-talk.In private, EU diplomats make no secret at all of their rejection of large chunks of the White Paper. Brussels has said since the beginning of Brexit negotiations that the UK can't pick and choose the ""best parts"" of EU membership and walk away from the rest when it leaves. Yet that's exactly how the White Paper is interpreted in EU circles.There is no way Michel Barnier will accept it as is.For Theresa May to get that ""deep and special"" access to the EU in trade terms, Brussels will certainly expect more concessions. But EU leaders are biding their time. Trying to calculate not if, but when, and how to get their criticisms across.They're very aware of the febrile political atmosphere in the UK and think if they make a quick comment or criticism of the White Paper, they'd be adding fuel to the fire.So if the EU is so keen for a soft Brexit - (of course we know, deep down, it would prefer no Brexit at all) - what concessions is Brussels prepared to make now to help shore up the prime minister's position in the political maelstrom at home?Worryingly few, is the answer if you're a fan of Theresa May or her White Paper.The EU still believes it holds pretty much all the cards in Brexit negotiations. I don't expect real whiffs of EU concessions before the last minute of the 11th hour this autumn.Can Theresa May hang on till then? And if she can, is she politically strong enough to strike a deal with Brussels and then sell it back home? Frankly, no one knows - and in the meantime, Brussels is stepping up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. Not because the EU or Downing Street wants that - they really do not - but because the time allotted under EU law for a withdrawal agreement to be agreed and signed off by both parties is fast running out. In the meantime, EU diplomats try to sound upbeat: the White Paper is a great springboard from which to re-start face-to-face Brexit negotiations, they say.Those talks begin again behind closed doors on Monday."

Having to play nice with the person you don't have very much in common with, because it's the right thing to do.Knowing that lots of people you DO like would be upset if you don't put on a show. Well, how about this: Having to ""play nice"" publicly with a person you don't have very much in common with, when they have said that the way you are trying to do your job doesn't really work. Add in the embarrassment if they happen to be the leader of the free world. From the moment of his election, Donald Trump was an awkward friend for Theresa May. He runs towards a fight. She does everything in public to avoid one. Well, just before they were due to appear alongside each other on UK soil he publicly, and at length, gave a ""both barrels"" verdict on her most important policy. Her approach to Brexit has been slowly, gently, incrementally, trying to carry the Ming vase across one side of the room to another on a slippery floor.To talk about being pragmatic, to smooth over the contradictions, to do whatever it takes to get to the other side, without smashing that vase (her party and the country) to bits. In walks President Trump, to call out one of the claims that Number 10 has been making of late - in essence, smashing the vase to bits. In an interview with The Sun, he shoots down the chances of a trade deal with the US if she sticks to her carefully crafted compromise Brexit plan. That matters because the government has been clinging to the idea of trade deals with countries outside the EU as one of the benefits of Brexit, and claiming that the choice in the Chequers deal to stay close to the EU doesn't exclude those opportunities. This isn't about what side anyone was on in the referendum. In fact, Remainers and Leavers unite in saying the Chequers deal can't live up to all it claims. For former Remainers, it's nuts to think that trade deals with non-EU countries can ever make up for what might be lost. For some Leavers, it's nuts to claim we can make the most of the world outside if we are still sticking to EU rules. And President Trump drives a bulldozer through the government's central claims about their compromise - that the UK would be able to get decent trade deals with the wider world, while sticking to the EU rules. A lot of this visit has been carefully choreographed, as the prime minister and the president dance around each other. But if the president really wanted to help her build support for her controversial compromise, this isn't the way to do it. "

He added that Europe as a whole was ""losing its culture"" because of immigration from the Middle East and Africa.The Washington Post said Mr Trump had ""blasted"" Mrs May while praising her ""archrival"", former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson who resigned earlier this week over the Brexit plan.The newspaper quoted a US official who said there was ""no way Trump will apologise"" for what he said in the interview but added ""we also don't want to blow everything up"".Another official said President Trump had been privately critical of Mrs May ""for many months"", discussing her vulnerabilities and criticising her political acumen.White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders had told the British government about the interview in advance, ""but thought it would be somewhat more positive"", the newspaper quoted an official as saying.In a statement, Ms Sanders said: ""The President likes and respects Prime Minister May very much. As he said in his interview with The Sun she 'is a very good person' and he 'never said anything bad about her'."" The New York Times said Mr Trump had ""given Mrs May's teetering government a shove"".It said the US president's interview was a ""remarkable breach of protocol"" and, coming after his ""combative"" performance at a Nato meeting in Brussels, amounted to a ""global disruption tour unlike anything undertaken by any other recent American president"".The Politico website described Mr Trump's interview as ""one way to break up a special relationship"".It speculated that Mr Trump may have been ""wound up"" over Brexit by British politician Nigel Farage, the former UK Independence Party leader who campaigned for years for Britain to leave the EU, or that his comments may have been informed by a meeting between his security adviser John Bolton and the ERG, a group of strongly pro-Brexit Conservative Party MPs.But it said the most likely outcome was that Mrs May would suggest that she explain her Brexit plan to Mr Trump, Mr Trump will agree to listen and ""they'll both claim the story was overwritten, and then try to go about their day"".White House correspondents for Axios and the Toronto Star said The Sun had ""over-egged"" Mr Trump's comments apparently ruling out a US-UK trade deal.In a commentary for the Breitbart website, British writer James Delingpole said Mr Trump had ""dropped the mother of all Brexit bombs"" on Mrs May.It ""poured nitroglycerine on an already explosive political issue which threatens to destroy May and possibly even bring down her government"", he said.Mr Delingpole said Mr Trump had placed himself on the side of the ""Brexit resistance"" with the likes of Mr Johnson and Mr Farage and said that his ""outrageous, protocol breaching intervention"" had ""infuriated the liberal elite"".""For the majority of British people who support Brexit, this could scarcely have come at a more welcome or desperate time,"" Mr Delingpole said.Former US ambassador to the EU Anthony Gardner tweeted that it was ""unprecedented to attack ally during state visit"" and said Mr Trump was ""out of control and an embarrassment"".On CNN, Stephen Collinson also said Mr Trump had detonated a ""Brexit bomb"" and delivered an ""astonishing political knifing"" to Mrs May.It was just the latest instance of Mr Trump, ""who cosies up to foreign strongmen like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, insulting or criticising an allied leader"", Mr Collinson said.The blog Red State said it would be ""interesting to see how the Brits react to this"".The US ""would not be thrilled if such conditions were put on us after a vote of the whole country"", it said. ""How a country deals with other countries in trade is their business,"" it added.US political website The Hill also focused on Mr Trump's comments about ""millions and millions of people"" coming to Europe from the Middle East and Africa.It said they reprised ""a line that he had frequently used on the campaign trail - that Europe was being overrun by non-Europeans and was quickly becoming a shell of what it once was"".The Hill noted that migration levels to Europe had declined since 2015, when more than a million people, many fleeing the Syrian civil war and other conflicts, arrived.Fox News said Mr Trump's comments were a ""body blow"" to Mrs May's government."
2018-07-15,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180715234053/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44807561,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government has published its long-awaited Brexit White Paper. The document is 104 pages long and follows last week's Chequers agreement which set out the sort of relationship the UK wants with the EU after Brexit.The White Paper is split into four chapters: economic partnership, security, cooperation and institutional arrangements. Most of the debate surrounds the first section, the future economic relationship.So here are the key excerpts from the chapter on ""economic partnership"" and what they mean.This is a line that emerged in the Chequers statement last Friday, and it is one of the most important in this White Paper. It is the UK government's answer to the concerns expressed by businesses that rely on ""just-in-time"" manufacturing supply chains (such as car manufacturers), and to the need to avoid the reimposition of a hard border in Ireland. The White Paper proposes a free trade area for goods - but it is very close to single market membership for goods in all but name. The suggestion of a common rulebook sounds very collaborative, but it does - in effect - mean the UK agreeing to take on the EU's rules and regulations in all these areas.If the UK parliament chose not to sign up to any of those rules, the idea of frictionless trade would begin to fall apart. The other big sensitivity in this section will be the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).The White Paper says the role of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end, and it sets out detailed proposals for joint institutional arrangements to police future economic ties. But the ECJ is the ultimate legal authority on EU rules with which the UK proposes to harmonise.  There's more detail here about how the UK proposes to combine bits of its two previous customs proposals, to create an entirely new customs relationship with the EU. It would take advantage of new technologies to make trade as frictionless as possible, but it would still involve the UK collecting EU tariffs (taxes on imports) at UK borders on the EU's behalf - something which isn't done anywhere else in the world on any significant scale. The White Paper says the UK would also apply its own tariffs, and an independent trade policy, for goods intended for consumption in the UK. In other words, it would still seek to strike its own trade deals around the world, even though it would be bound by EU rules and regulations. For once, Brexiteers and the EU appear united - neither thinks the proposal has much chance of working because of its sheer complexity. Unsurprisingly the UK government disputes that, and says it wants to be at the cutting edge of global customs policy. But it's also worth noting that the White Paper says the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) would have to be phased in - which is code for saying that it wouldn't be ready by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020. The White Paper confirms that the UK will seek active participation in (if not full membership of) the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and the European Medicines Agency. The government is keen to address business demands that they only need to go through one approval mechanism to access both markets, in highly regulated parts of the economy. The EU has previously ruled out full UK membership of these agencies, and noted that it would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice if it were to sign up to their rules and regulations. The White Paper accepts that the UK would not have any voting rights in the way the agencies go about their business, and that it would have to make appropriate financial contributions to them. This is part of the pragmatic Brexit the government is now advocating, but it is not the resumption of full UK sovereignty that some leading leave campaigners had promised. The section on services confirms that the UK is seeking a looser relationship with the EU for roughly 80% of the UK economy. Financial and other services will no longer be able to take advantage of passporting, which gives them automatic access to other EU markets (the UK's Financial Conduct Authority says about 5,500 UK financial firms currently have EU passporting rights). The government has abandoned plans for a new relationship based on the concept of mutual recognition of financial regulations, partly because it had been so comprehensively rejected by the EU. But it is still seeking something more ambitious than the ""equivalence' regime"" that the EU has with most other third countries (part of the problem with that is that it can be withdrawn, by either side, with just 30 days notice). So, the UK argues that the importance of the City of London to the EU's entire financial system means a more ambitious solution needs to be found.  The trouble with a lot of these proposals though is that the EU will see them as cherry-picking from the four freedoms that underpin the single market. It has already said that the UK cannot have full access to the single market for goods and not services, especially if it is determined to end the free movement of people. The White Paper emphasises repeatedly that free movement of people will come to an end. Full details of a new immigration policy are due to be published in a separate White Paper, which has already been delayed several times. But there are hints in this document of what could be to come - it sets out proposals for a mobility framework, which is pretty standard in trade agreements. It could - among other things - ""allow citizens to travel freely, without a visa, for tourism and temporary business activity."" But some Brexiteers fear that what will eventually emerge will be free movement under another name, and they are already suspicious that this is just an opening bid from the government. The EU will certainly push for further concessions if the UK is to get anything close to the economic relationship it wants.Part of the problem for the UK is that it is asking the EU to be a little bit more flexible in the way it interprets its rules-based system. But that request is being made at a time when the EU thinks its rules are under threat from external sources like President Trump, and internal sources like governments in Italy, Hungary and Poland.

2018-07-15,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180715234053/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-15,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180715234053/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-07-16,Government scrapes through EU customs votes,https://web.archive.org//web/20180716224724/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44854597,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government has narrowly avoided a defeat on its Customs Bill after agreeing to Brexiteers' demands to change its wording.It twice survived by just three votes after a backlash from pro-EU Tories who accused Theresa May of ""caving in"" to the party's Eurosceptic MPs.Defence Minister Guto Bebb resigned so he could vote against the government.MPs will carry on debating Brexit on Tuesday when the Trade Bill comes to the Commons.It gives the government the power to build new trade relationships around the world after the UK leaves the EU, and MPs who support staying in the EU's customs union are seeking to change its wording.Critics said the amendments to the Customs Bill laid down by Eurosceptics on Monday would undermine the UK's recently-announced negotiating position.But Downing Street, which agreed earlier to accept the four amendments, said they were ""consistent"" with the White Paper where it sets out how it wants to trade with the EU in years to come.The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work.The government, which does not have a Commons majority, has been under pressure from MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate.This was underlined on Monday as it first accepted a series of demands from Brexiteers who are unhappy at the proposals in the White Paper, believing it keeps the UK too closely tied to the EU.But this angered MPs from the party's pro-EU wing who refused to back the new amendments, leading to heated exchanges in the House of Commons as the Customs Bill was debated.Tory MP and Remainer Heidi Allen said she wished the prime minister had ""faced down the amendments.""She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What was agreed at Chequers wasn't perfect to us, wasn't perfect to Leavers either, but I think the prime minister had worked exceptionally hard to find a decent first pitch to put to the EU and move forward from that.""We were all set [on the Remain side] to drop all our amendments and back it, then suddenly we had these rather extreme last minute manoeuvres, which seem to us to deviate the prime minister from her plan and we weren't prepared to do that.""Ms Allen said it was now up to Mrs May to ""pick the side of the economy"". Pro-EU MP Anna Soubry suggested backbench Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg was now ""running Britain"".Another Remainer, former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, said the prime minister had, by accepting the amendments, put herself in ""a position of considerable weakness"".Mr Rees-Mogg said the amendments were ""broadly in line"" with government policy, which is why the government accepted them.By 305 votes to 302 - with 14 Tories rebelling - MPs backed an amendment that prevents the UK from collecting taxes on behalf of the EU, unless the rest of the EU does the same for the UK.Applying EU tariffs to products destined for the EU is part of Mrs May's plan to avoid friction at UK borders after Brexit.Another amendment, to ensure the UK is out of the EU's VAT regime, was backed by 303 to 300, with a Tory rebellion of 11.Three Labour MPs voted with the government.The government won several other votes more comfortably, and the entire bill was then approved by the House of Commons by 318 to 285.BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergIt looks a mess because it is a mess. It's getting harder and harder for the prime minister to get things through Parliament - and while calls for a second referendum are widely rejected, that sentiment could change if this kind of gridlock continues.The PM has spent the last two years trying to compromise. She has a divided party and no majority. There are no easy choices.But the divisions in the Tory party are daily reducing her room for manoeuvre. In a debate about principle, the problem for some is that compromise is a dirty word.Read Laura's blogThe three Labour MPs who rebelled against their party whip by voting with the government were Frank Field, Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer - all of whom are pro-Brexit.Former Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins who now sits as an independent also supported the government on one of the amendments.The Conservative rebels were the long-time pro-EU MP Ken Clarke, Heidi Allen, Guto Bebb, Richard Benyon, Jonathan Djanogly, Dominic Grieve, Stephen Hammond, Philip Lee, Nicky Morgan, Robert Neill, Mark Pawsey, Antoinette Sandbach, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston.BBC Europe editor, Katya Adler said the one priority the EU has is making sure it gets a deal, rather than a ""cliff edge"" Brexit. She told Today: ""They are following all the ins and outs, and all the turbulence, in UK politics extremely carefully.""[But] they are wondering if the prime minister - or anyone who could or might take over from her - would even have the political strength to get a deal agreed here in Brussels, then passed by parliament back home.""Adler said the ""normally outspoken EU leaders"" are keeping quiet as they don't want to ""put their oar in right now and risk blowing the whole thing up"".The new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is due in Brussels on Thursday to continue negotiations and the EU wants to engage, she added. ""All my EU sources say they want to engage constructively with the whitepaper and avoid giving the impression that it is dead on arrival.""But importantly, as everyone knows, time for negotiation is running short. They want to complete the withdrawal agreement."""
2018-07-16,No 10 rejects Greening's referendum call,https://web.archive.org//web/20180716224724/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44840154,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDowning Street has rejected Justine Greening's call for a fresh referendum on the UK's exit from the EU, saying it will not happen ""in any circumstances"".The former education secretary argued the final Brexit decision should be given back to the people and out of the hands of ""deadlocked politicians"".She called for three options to be on the ballot paper: the prime minister's Chequers deal, staying in the EU or a clean break from Europe with no deal.The UK is due to leave in March 2019.Amid continuing Tory divisions over Mrs May's strategy, the government has accepted changes to legislation for customs arrangements after the UK leaves to avoid a Commons rebellion by Brexit-backing MPs.No 10 said the amendments to the Customs Bill, including one that would preclude the UK from collecting tariffs on goods bound for EU countries, were ""consistent"" with the blueprint agreed by the cabinet. Asked during a Commons statement on last week's Nato summit whether she was ""rolling over"", Mrs May said she would continue to ""listen to the concerns"" of colleagues regarding Brexit-related legislation. Ms Greening, who resigned after the cabinet reshuffle in January, said the referendum should offer a first and second preference vote so that a consensus can be reached.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Greening said the government's proposals were a ""genuine clever attempt at a compromise that could work"" but ""suits no-one"".The MP for Putney said: ""The reality is Parliament is now stalemated. Whatever the proposal on the table, there will be MPs who vote it down. But Britain needs to find a route forward.""Ms Greening, who supported Remain in the EU referendum, is the highest profile ex-Cabinet minister to call for a second referendum.She said there were other senior Conservatives who agreed with her stance, adding that people who supported Leave in the referendum would also feel the government's approach is ""not what they voted for"".In her article in the Times, she lambasted the PM's Brexit blueprint, saying: ""We'll be dragging Remain voters out of the EU for a deal that means still complying with many EU rules, but now with no say on shaping them.""It's not what they want, and on top of that when they hear that Leave voters are unhappy, they ask, 'What's the point?' ""For Leavers, this deal simply does not deliver the proper break from the European Union that they wanted.""By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondentCombine a hung parliament with Brexit, and when you scan your eye around the House of Commons, you sometimes wonder if they can collectively agree on anything. The one thing there is certainly not much public support for right now among MPs is another referendum.Whatever the view of an individual MP on Brexit, most see making the case for another schlep to the polling station a hard argument to flog.And so while those doing so are a pretty small tribe, and it is a million miles from a majority view, there is pride among them that they can add another name to their gang.But it is worth remembering that Justine Greening is a pro-European in a marginal seat - Putney in London - that voted heavily to Remain.Ms Greening, who grew up in Rotherham, where 68% people voted to leave the EU, said the parliamentary stalemate ""risks a no-confidence vote and, worse, a Corbyn government, which would be disastrous for the economy"".She had previously suggested a future generation of MPs will seek to ""improve or undo"" Brexit if it does not work for young people. Fellow Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who backed Leave in the referendum, said he agreed with Ms Greening that the PM's plan was ""dead"" but described her call for a second vote as ""a little ill-thought-out"".""If we wanted to extend the uncertainty for another long period this is one way of doing it,"" he told Today.Mrs May has ruled out a second vote, as has Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, although a number of senior Labour figures are backing the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a final vote on any exit deal. Pro-EU Conservative MP Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme the possibility of holding a second referendum should not be excluded but Mrs May was ""entitled to try to develop"" her Chequers plan.""My primary political duty at the moment is to try and help get this country through a Brexit process that is endangering its stability and its wellbeing,"" he said.Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said another referendum was ""heading much closer"" but could be avoided if the Tories changed leader, adding there was ""uproar out there"" about the prime minister's proposals.Suella Braverman, who used to lead a Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs and is now a minister in the Brexit department, said there were ""obviously strong views"" within her party and described the Chequers plan as a ""starting point"" for negotiations with the EU.But the disagreements in the party have also led to another resignation from the government. Scott Mann has quit his job as a parliamentary private secretary at the Treasury, saying Mrs May's plan was ""in direct conflict"" with the views of his Leave-voting constituents in north Cornwall and he did not want to deliver a ""watered-down Brexit"" to them.

MPs would vote on the motion on Wednesday. It comes as MPs have been debating changes to the prime minister's plans for leaving the EU. Labour's Angela Rayner called the motion ""pathetic"" - her party, the SNP and some Tories oppose the plan.Labour backbencher David Lammy said it was ""a government that has run out of ideas"".Some Conservative backbenchers said they would vote against the motion including former ministers Nicholas Soames and Nick Boles. Sir Michael Fallon, former defence secretary, was said by the Daily Telegraph to be voting against. The Tory chair of the Health Select Committee, Sarah Wollaston, said she was opposed to an early recess - adding that her committee would be sitting as usual next Tuesday.There has been speculation that the government might abandon the idea of bringing the recess date forward.Downing Street said they were ""considering all of the representations which have been received"".MPs will return to the Commons on 4 September."

Ephraim Mirvis said Labour's anti-Semitism definition sent ""an unprecedented message of contempt to the Jewish community"".Labour has defended its new code as the most ""comprehensive"" of any party.However, Labour MPs have overwhelmingly backed calls to broaden their party's definition of anti-Semitism.The MPs backed a motion to adopt in full the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) working definition of anti-Semitism.Labour's code, which was approved by a sub-committee of its National Executive Committee (NEC) earlier this month, was drawn up following the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry into anti-Semitism.The NEC rubber-stamped the new code when it met on Tuesday, but a Labour spokesperson added: ""In recognition of the serious concerns expressed, agreed to re-open the development of the code, in consultation with Jewish community organisations and groups, in order to better reflect their views.""The code does endorse the IHRA's working definition of anti-Semitism and includes behaviours it lists as likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples from that definition:Chief rabbi Ephraim Mirvis attacked the omission of these examples and said it was ""astonishing that the Labour Party presumes it is more qualified"" to define anti-Semitism than the Jewish community.""Adoption of Labour's new alternative to the internationally accepted IHRA definition will send an unprecedented message of contempt to the Jewish community,"" he added.In a letter to members of Labour's ruling committee he said this was ""a watershed moment"" for the party and urged them to ""make the right decision for Britain"".However, Labour insists the four examples are addressed in their guidelines.""These are the most detailed and comprehensive guidelines on anti-Semitism adopted by any political party in this country,"" the party said.""They adopt the IHRA definition and contextualise and add to the working examples to produce a practical code of conduct that a political party can apply in disciplinary cases.""The vote taken at the Parliamentary Labour Party meeting is not binding on the party."

""The failure to disclose this information meant that viewers were misled. Because viewer trust in this current affairs programme would have been undermined, we considered that this was materially misleading.""The inaugural episode of the Alex Salmond Show, which is broadcast on Russian state-funded broadcaster RT, featured an interview with ousted Catalan President Carles Puigdemont.It also included messages which former SNP MP Mr Salmond said had been selected from an ""avalanche of tweets and emails"".One was labelled as being from a Twitter account which does not exist - something Slàinte Media said at the time was due to a ""transcription error"" in a misspelled username.Another tweet was only published after the show had aired, which the company said had been emailed in and only posted publicly by its author after he had seen it broadcast.Slàinte Media - which is run by Mr Salmond and fellow former SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh - said a further tweet from series director Luisa St John had been ""used for the filmed rehearsal and left in the final programme cut in a simple error"".In its defence, the programme makers told Ofcom: ""There was no agenda and no attempt to mislead nor can it be seriously argued that there was and the fact that only a single complaint was made demonstrated there was no harm or offence, particularly given the substantial prior publicity and the fact that the whole basis of that single complaint was clearly misconceived.""The RT channel criticised Ofcom, saying it had used ""a real sledgehammer to crack a nut"".It further commented: ""This was a notable and worrying example of Ofcom's orchestration of the media in this matter by publicising, without notice to RT, its provisional findings for its decision in this case in a statement made on April 18. ""This was before it had heard, let alone had time to consider, RTs representations on its preliminary view.  ""This gives rise to grave concern over the fairness of Ofcom's process and agenda. The concern is heightened as Ofcom is using powers that exist for protection against serious matters to find in breach this trivial teething problem."""

And they were set to show their displeasure by trying to amend the Taxation (Cross Border Trade) Bill, known as the Customs Bill.Downing Street now says it will accept the four amendments - one of which could stop the UK from collecting tariffs for the EU, part of Theresa May's Chequers plan, unless the rest of the EU reciprocates.Another change could make the EU's ""backstop"" on customs impossible by ruling out a border in the Irish Sea.The other two amendments would ensure the UK was out of the EU's VAT regime and require new legislation if the government wanted to form a customs union with the EU.Govt spokesman says of Chequers amendments -  'We believe they are consistent with the White Paper,' - problem is not v many other people do, whether Leave or former RemainersEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakTheresa May's spokesman said the changes were ""consistent"" with the proposals put forward by the government so far.But Conservative MP Anna Soubry said the prime minister's Chequers plan had now been ""wrecked by caving in to the hard, no-deal Brexiteers"".Another Tory MP, Heidi Allen, said the amendments ""fundamentally undermine the Chequers proposal"".In the Commons, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said the prime minister had ""capitulated"" to  Conservative Brexiteers and that the proposals agreed at the Chequers summit were now ""dead in the water"".Mrs May denied this, adding: ""I would not have gone through all the work that I did to ensure that we reached that agreement only to see it changed in some way through these bills.""The government, which does not have a Commons majority, has been under pressure from MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate.As news broke that the Brexiteers' amendments had been accepted, there were angry exchanges between Conservative MPs as the Customs Bill was debated.Pro-EU Anna Soubry suggested backbench Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg was now ""running Britain"".""This government is in grave danger of not just losing the plot but losing a considerable amount of support from the people of this country unless we get Brexit right,"" she said.As Ms Soubry praised former prime minister Margaret Thatcher's support of free trade, she was told by former Tory minister Sir Edward Leigh that she ""ain't no Margaret Thatcher"".""I don't pretend to be able to walk in Margaret Thatcher's boots,"" she responded.Later, Ms Soubry said: ""Nobody voted Leave on the basis that somebody with a gold-plated pension and inherited wealth would take their job away from them.""David Davis, who resigned as Brexit secretary in protest at the Chequers proposals, urged MPs to support the Customs Bill, describing it as ""vital legislation"".Mr Davis said the EU was a ""slow and not very effective negotiator of free trade agreements"", and that the UK had a negotiating hand ""over and above our economic weight"".The trouble with the tariffs amendment is that it seems to blow a hole in the government's policy of forming what it calls a Facilitated Customs Arrangement with the EU.The plan was that the UK would collect EU tariffs on goods imported into the UK and pass them onto Brussels if the goods were destined for the EU, but British firms could get a rebate if the goods stayed in the UK.It was messy, complicated and many thought it unworkable, but it was always assumed that the EU would not reciprocate - that they would not collect tariffs for the UK at their ports in return.Insisting that they have to do so will be difficult if not impossible to get around.Earlier Mr Davis said he still backed Theresa May, telling reporters as he left his London home that ""my name's not Geoffrey Howe"" - a reference to the late Conservative politician whose barbed criticisms of Margaret Thatcher during his resignation speech in 1990 paved the way for her subsequent downfall. Scott Mann became the latest Tory MP to stand down as a ministerial aide to the Treasury in protest at the PM's plan, following Robert Courts who did the same on Sunday. Former education secretary Justine Greening said the plan was the ""worst of both worlds"" as she became the most senior Tory politician to call for another referendum on the final deal to break the current ""deadlock"".

2018-07-16,Gove 'wanted different feel' to Vote Leave,https://web.archive.org//web/20180716224724/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44852447,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMichael Gove has distanced himself from some of the arguments he made during the Brexit referendum, including claims over levels of Turkish immigration.The Leave campaign was criticised at the time for suggesting Turkey may join the EU by 2020 and up to 5.2m more migrants could come to the UK by 2030.In a new book, Mr Gove says it ""did not get everything absolutely right"".""If it had been left entirely to me, the Leave campaign would have had a slightly different feel,"" he admits. The remarks feature in a new book about the campaign and political drama that followed it written by Tom Baldwin, a former Times journalist who was once a colleague of ex-journalist Mr Gove on the paper.Mr Baldwin subsequently worked for Ed Miliband as his communications director during the 2015 election, and now works for the People's Vote campaign, which wants a referendum on the final UK-EU deal.Claims about levels of Turkish immigration to the UK were among the most contentious of the referendum campaign.Vote Leave suggested the UK would not be in a position to stop Turkey joining the EU and warned of an influx of migrants putting more pressure on public services.The claims were repeated by key figures, including current cabinet ministers Mr Gove and Penny Mordaunt and ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson. In a speech during the campaign, Mr Gove said the continued free movement of people from the EU would have ""huge consequences"" for the health service, saying ""the idea of asking the NHS to look after a new group of patients equivalent in size to four Birminghams is clearly unsustainable"".The claims about Turkey were strongly rejected at the time by Downing Street, which insisted that its accession was a long way off and that the UK would have a veto anyway. In an interview for the book, Ctrl Alt Delete, Mr Baldwin asked the environment secretary whether he was entirely comfortable in ""appealing to some very low sentiments"".Mr Gove is quoted as replying: ""I know what you mean, yes. If it had been left entirely to me, the Leave campaign would have had a slightly different feel.""I would have to go back and look at everything I said and think whether that was the right response at the right time. There is a sense at the back of my mind that we did not get everything absolutely right.""It's a difficult one.""Mr Gove is also pressed in the book about his much-quoted claim from the campaign that people had ""had enough of experts"" telling them what to think about Brexit.He says the remark was spontaneous rather than intended and designed not to denigrate expertise but to highlight past claims, such as over the 2008 financial crisis, which had been wrong.""The irony, of course, is that I often cite experts to justify what I am doing,"" he adds."
2018-07-16,Daughters in legal bid for Lords seats,https://web.archive.org//web/20180716224724/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44844335,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFive daughters of hereditary peers are to challenge a law that stops them from being elected to the House of Lords.They are taking the government to the European Court of Human Rights in a bid to end the system of male primogeniture which has resulted in almost all titles being passed to male heirs.Lawyers argue they face discrimination on the grounds of their gender.The group accuse the government of ""double standards"" because it promotes women's rights. The woman involved in the case are: Lady Willa Franks, eldest daughter of the Earl of Balfour; Lady Eliza Dundas, eldest daughter of the Earl of Ronaldshay;  Sarah Long, elder sister to the current Viscount Long of Wraxall; Tanya Field, eldest daughter of the Earl of Macclesfield, and Hatta Byng, eldest daughter of Viscount Torrington.Under the principle of male primogeniture, sons, nephews and uncles take precedence over daughters, nieces and aunts when a title is passed on to the next generation.The five women, who are part of the Daughters' Rights campaign, want the UK government to remove the word ""male"" from legislation they describe as ""outdated"" so they can stand for by-elections to the Lords.While some hereditary titles can be inherited by women because of the rules surrounding the way they were originally created, all but one of 92 current hereditary peers are male. The Daughters' Rights campaign says the system breaches Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, when taken alongside Article 3 of the First Protocol, the right to a free election. New rules on royal succession came into force in 2015 to remove male bias, meaning that Princess Charlotte is currently fourth in line to the throne.In 2013 the Equality (Titles) Bill was introduced in the Lords with a view to allowing for equal succession of female heirs to hereditary titles and peerages but it was voted down.That proposed change became known as the Downton Abbey law after the ITV drama series carried a storyline where the Earl of Grantham's title passed to a distant relative he had never met, instead of one of his three daughters.UK courts do not have oversight over the rules governing parliamentary procedure. Solicitor Paul Hardy, from law firm DLA Piper which is bringing the case, said the application to the European Court of Human Rights ""raises profound questions about sexual equality and membership of the House of Lords"". The barrister for the campaign, Edward Legard, said: ""It seems wrong in a country where women, including now royal women, are born with equal opportunities, that we continue to discriminate against one group based only on gender."""

The prime minister also said that her Brexit plan would secure millions of aviation jobs in Britain.It comes amid growing criticism of her plan from MPs, with another government member resigning in protest on Sunday.The proposal urges close links with the EU on trade in goods, but not services.In a speech at the Farnborough Airshow on Monday, she offered more than £300m of government and industry money for several projects, including research on more environmentally-friendly aircraft. There will be additional money for two new spaceports - one in Cornwall, one in Scotland - and a long-awaited commitment to build a new high-tech fighter aircraft that will eventually replace the Eurofighter Typhoon.The UK aviation sector generates turnover of about £60bn and supports almost a million jobs. British aerospace exports alone were worth £30bn in 2017.However, industry trade association ADS has warned the sector could be paralysed if Britain leaves the EU customs union and single market, given its dependence on cross-border trade in components. In June, Airbus UK boss Tom Enders said it could pull production out of the UK if it quit the bloc without a transition deal. The French firm employs about 14,000 people in Britain.However, last week, Mr Enders tentatively welcomed Mrs May's plan, saying the government is now moving in the right direction. But in an interview with the BBC, the boss of Airbus's arch-rival, Boeing, pledged to keep investing in Britain. Dennis Muilenberg said while the company did not welcome disruption to the movement of goods - or to the Europe-wide systems of aviation regulation - his company's plans would not be changed by the UK's plans to leave the EU.""We are going to continue to grow in the UK,"" he said, adding that Boeing would maintain a long-term view of its UK investments, ""regardless of how Brexit plays out"".However, he added there were worries over whether ""we continue to see free flow of goods and services"".In her speech, Mrs May argued that her proposals - including frictionless free trade in goods and the avoidance of a hard border in Northern Ireland - would protect the supply chains that big aerospace firms depend on.She also said the UK could remain part of EU agencies critical for the aerospace industry, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency.""By working closely together, government and industry have ensured we remain at the forefront of civil aviation and that our air power is second to none,"" she said.""Today I want us to build on that, and ensure not only that we retain our prominence, but that in an increasingly competitive industry we make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead.""ADS has welcomed the government's plan, but insists there are important and complex issues still to be resolved.However, chief executive Paul Everitt said the prime minister's remarks were a ""strong statement of intent"" that would help build confidence and encourage investment. ""The international political, military and business leaders visiting Farnborough will be reassured by last week's Brexit White Paper and are keen to hear more about the UK's post-Brexit ambitions."""

Two members of the cabinet - Boris Johnson and David Davis - have resigned in protest at the plan, as Eurosceptic Tories claim it sticks too closely to EU rules and regulations.Mr Jones has welcomed the proposals as coming closer to the Welsh Government's preference for a close trading relationship. ""While the prime minister refuses to admit that her ill-judged red lines are a thing of the past, she has - at long last - set out a vaguely credible negotiating position,"" he said. ""The UK government white paper advocates partial participation in the Single Market and continued participation in a Customs Union by any other name.""There are many flaws in the proposals and far too many questions remain unanswered. ""However, I believe it is a basis on which more serious negotiations can now start.""Last month, Carwyn Jones gave a speech in London aimed at the prime minister - change tack or the UK faces the ""very real possibility of a catastrophic no-deal Brexit"", he said. Today, he's still warning about the possibility of the UK and the EU failing to reach a deal, but now he's calling on officials in Brussels to blur their negotiating 'red lines'.Although far from lavishing praise on the UK government's new Brexit plan, it's an interesting change of emphasis from a first minister who has to date exclusively fired his rhetorical arrows towards Downing Street.Why the change? Well, with just eight months to go until the official Brexit day on 29 March 2019 and still some pretty major hurdles to clear in the negotiations, there is genuine concern amongst Welsh Government officials about a 'no-deal' Brexit.Given the pressure Theresa May has been under from her own Tory MPs since reaching the Chequers agreement, she'll be sure to welcome the unlikeliest of helping hands from a Welsh Labour first minister.In his initial response to the white paper, Mr Barnier said he would ""analyse the proposals"".However Brussels has repeatedly said the UK cannot ""cherry-pick"" its way out of the EU.In response to that, Mr Jones urged the other 27 EU member states to ""show an element of flexibility to avoid the catastrophic 'no deal' scenario"". ""By stepping over the red lines and working together I believe we can reach an agreement that provides the basis for a long-term economic relationship."""
2018-07-16,'Behaviour code' could see MPs face sack,https://web.archive.org//web/20180716224724/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44845432,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs and Lords could be sacked if new plans to deal with allegations of harassment and bullying are approved. The new Commons behaviour code published on Tuesday includes ""harsh punishments"" for those who do not meet parliamentary standards. A working group was set up in November to look into creating a grievance process after Westminster was hit with a string of scandals. The proposals will be voted on by MPs on Thursday. Two government ministers - Damian Green and Michael Fallon - resigned over scandals last year, and a number of other politicians on both sides of the House were  investigated over claims of sexual misconduct.A survey of more than 1,300 parliamentary workers published in February found that 19% had experienced or witnessed sexual harassment or inappropriate behaviour in the previous year, with twice as many complaints from women than men.Ms Leadsom said that at the moment, anyone with a complaint only has the choice of going to the press. She claimed the ""step by step"" plan recommended by the working group offers a more official path of grievance and will be ""entirely independent in every way"".If approved, two helplines would be created - one for bullying and harassment allegations, and a second specifically for sexual harassment or sexual violence.Mediation would be offered as a first step, if that is what the victim wanted, but the complaint could then move to a formal, independent investigation. The Commissioner for Standards would have powers to deal out low levels of punishment - such as calling for an apology or insisting on compulsory training for the staff member involved. But if the complaint is more serious, it could then be passed to the committee of standards - made up of seven MPs and seven lay people - who would be able to vote on more serious sanctions, including sacking. The most serious sanctions would go to the Commons for a vote, and could lead to by-elections being called. The Members' and Peers' Staff Association said the plan was a ""robust and progressive way forward"". ""We hope that everyone both on the Parliamentary estate and in constituency offices will now fully engage with the new processes and that the bullying and harassment that we have seen will be eradicated to provide a safe and confident place for all staff to work,"" said its steering group representative Georgina Kester. But the BBC's political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said concerns had been raised by the FDA union that the new system will involve MPs making judgements on other MPs, in effect marking their own homework. There is also criticism about the system's focus on new accusations, with little scope for historic incidents to be investigated.  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour on Sunday, Ms Leadsom said the new system would ""put the victim at the heart of it"". ""Anybody who works in, with or for Parliament, must be given the same access to an equal and fair system that gives them the satisfaction of final closure of their complaint,"" she said.Ms Leadsom said those with older complaints would be able to call for ""advice, guidance and support"" - but it would be difficult to gather evidence for past cases. However, she did say that the group would be establishing an independent review of historic allegations, which she hopes would help ""give [victims] closure"".She added that she had ""high hopes"" for the plans to be approved.  Also speaking to the Westminster Hour, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the plan seems like ""a step in the right direction"" - although he renewed calls for Parliament to recognise unions. He said it would ""probably"" get support from MPs, adding: ""The political parties have got to really tighten up their act on safeguarding and harassment.""Former International Development Secretary, Priti Patel, added: ""I came from a private sector career before and I think it's astonishing that we just do not have safeguards and the appropriate mechanisms in place. ""Parliament sounds like a very unattractive place to work when you hear these horrible stories so we need to take the right step forward, and clearly this is part of that."""

Writing in the Times, Justine Greening, who used to be education secretary, argued that another vote would be ""the only way to end deadlock"".But how, in practice, could a second vote happen?The government has ruled out a new Brexit referendum and the Labour party says it's unlikely - although its Shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, says it is sensible to keep ""all our options on the table"" - in the event of Parliament voting down a Brexit deal or in the case of a ""no deal"" scenario.Downing Street said, in response to Ms Greening, that a referendum will not happen ""in any circumstances"".So unless there is a dramatic change in party policy, it's highly unlikely a referendum would be called in the first place.That's because a referendum requires an Act of Parliament, which needs to be voted through by the majority of MPs.And while there are vocal supporters on all sides, currently there are not enough MPs who support the idea of a second referendum.Even if MPs and peers agreed in principle to hold a second referendum, the legislative process can be drawn out.Parliament would need to pass detailed rules for the conduct of the poll and the regulation of campaigners.It took  seven months before Parliament signed off the previous referendum legislation in 2015. Further time was also needed to pass secondary legislation on areas such as voting registration.In theory, Parliament could copy over some of the legislation from the 2015 Act in order to try to speed the process up. But according to David Jeffery, a politics lecturer at Liverpool University, this might not save a lot of time because issues would still need to be debated and scrutinised by MPs and Lords.Aside from the time to pass the legislation, there's also the length of the campaign to consider.Last time around there was a four-month period between the then Prime Minister David Cameron announcing the referendum in February 2016, and the vote taking place on 23 June.Furthermore, the Electoral Commission has recommended that in future there should be at least a six-month gap between legislation being passed and a referendum being held.That's to allow enough time to register campaigns, put counting officers in place and give people information on how to vote.So combining the time to pass the legislation and allowing for a campaign, it might not be possible to hold a second referendum before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU in March 2019 (i.e. when the Article 50 process is due to expire).And holding a referendum after the Article 50 process could cause a number of practical problems.For one, what if the country voted to remain in the EU, but had already left by the time the vote was held?This could be avoided if the EU agreed to extend the Article 50 deadline - but this would need to be unanimously agreed by all EU member states.There's also the referendum question itself and the options on the ballot paper to consider.These need to be presented ""clearly, simply and neutrally"", according to the Electoral Commission. Justine Greening argues for three options: accept a negotiated Brexit deal, stay in the EU, or leave with no deal.David Jeffery says having more than a yes/no option could complicate the process:""With three options you could have a situation where just 34% decide the winning option. ""And that leads to questions about the type of voting system you want - like choosing the options by preference order,"" he says.""But then you need to ask 'do the public understand the system and how might it work in such a short period of time?'""In the end it would be up to the Electoral Commission to assess that question.

2018-07-16,Week ahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20180716224724/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-44832598,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDoes the Government have a Commons majority anymore? Next week we will see the first post-Chequers test of whether disgruntled Brexiteer Tories, deeply unhappy with what they see as the PM's soft-boiled version of leaving the EU, will still toe the party line.For the last few months the Conservative whips have been seeking to fend off a threat on their Remain flank, posed by a group of up to 20 backbencher arguing for the softest possible Brexit; suddenly the threat comes from 60 to 80 Brexiteers. And unlike the Remainers, who have the air of refugee aristocrats, struggling to master the insurgent arts, they are mostly habitual rebels, case hardened by the battles of the Major and Cameron years. In short, the threat confronting the Chief Whip, Julian Smith, is suddenly orders of magnitude greater - and that was before President Trump added his few dimes' worth to the debate.One of the big determinants of Mr Smith's problems will be the conversations his flock will be having with their Conservative constituency associations over the weekend which will dictate the tone of the coming week; will MPs detect a yearning for unity from their troops, or a burning sense of Brexit betrayal? If the latter, all kinds of mayhem will follow - enough letters could be submitted to the Chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, to trigger a confidence vote in Theresa May. There might be more resignations, and a serious warning shot or two at the government in the votes due on the Customs and Trade bills, which are due for report stage consideration on Monday and Tuesday. Theresa May herself will have PMQs, and an appearance before the Liaison Committee, which will give her Tory critics a chance to vent at her. And she might also find herself fielding urgent questions in the backwash of the Trump visit and the NATO summit. Then there's Boris. Will the former Foreign Secretary, emboldened by presidential praise, seek to take his case to the Commons? I have no information one way or another, but next week provides a wealth of opportunities. He could speak in the debates on the Trade or Customs bills, or in Wednesday's general EU debate. Or he could opt for a full-dress resignation statement in the manner of Geoffrey Howe. Angry ex-colleagues can inflict near mortal wounds on Prime Ministers - Geoffrey Howe's evisceration of Margaret Thatcher in 1990 remains the classic example, although based on the opposite view of the EU. Or there was Norman Lamont's devastating attack on John Major - ""in office but not in power"". But for maximum effect, the resignee needs a packed House and the presence of his target, so the cameras can cut to her expression as each barb hits home - so a resignation statement after PMQs, giving the Prime Minister little opportunity to escape, and no opportunity to reply, looks to be the way to inflict maximum damage. Again, I emphasise, this is pure speculation in the absence of actual data - but hey.The Commons opens (2.30pm) with Home Office Questions - and any post-weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions (a reportback on the Nato summit, perhaps) to follow at 3.30pm. Then comes the first of the week's two big Brexit bills, the Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Bill - the report stage of this measure has been postponed for quite a while, for fear of a Tory Remainer ambush, but now, there's a new threat in the shape of four new amendments from Brexiteers: there are some pointed Brexiteer amendments - and even some chuntering that some Tory MPs might oppose the bill at third reading, to register a protest at the government's Brexit policy. Brexiteer and former Cabinet minister Priti Patel has new clause 36 which requires that HMRC won't collect other countries' tariffs unless there is a reciprocal arrangement; Bernard Jenkin's amendment 72 says the government will not be able to use powers to implement a customs union without a separate piece of legislation; Craig Mackinley's amendment 73 says the government will have to commit to having a separate VAT system to the EU, and Lawrence Robertson wants to rule out a customs border in the Irish Sea.Brexiteers are toying with a ""proof of life"" amendment to remove ministers powers to enact ""a"" customs union with the EU, on the argument that this is an option ruled out by the Chequers deal. In Westminster Hall there's a Petitions Committee debate on e-petition 222419: ""Reject calls to add Staffordshire Bull Terriers to the Dangerous Dogs Act.""In the Lords from 2.30 pm, there's a question on permitting the use of cannabis oil on prescription from the Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard.The main legislating is the second reading of the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill. Here, the key issue concerns the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards for people lacking mental capacity, who are detained for treatment in care homes or hospitals. The final business of the day is a short debate on maximising the income from the National Lottery and its use for the arts and good causes.The Commons opens (11.30am) with Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy questions. Will BEIS Secretary Greg Clark, seen as a key cabinet voice arguing for the softest possible Brexit, be targeted by hard Brexiteers on his own side?Then comes an intriguing Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative Giles Watling, who wants to regulate anti-loitering devices which emit a loud and painful sound that can only be heard by certain age groups, including children and teenagers. This sound is annoying to the point where people cannot stay in the area. But he believes they are not the right answer to anti-social behaviour, and only drive the problem elsewhere. So he proposes introducing a licence, regulated by a local authority. The day's main event will be the report and third reading stages of the Trade Bill - a Brexit measure designed to establish a framework for UK international trade, outside the EU institutions which have regulated it since 1972. Recent events may have taken the heat out of the ""Soubry"" amendment to keep the UK in ""a"" customs union with the EU.  There are several amendments along these lines from various different sources - but normally it's the rebel Conservative amendments which are most dangerous to the government. And the government has put down a raft of changes to meet concerns about excessive ministerial power.In Westminster Hall debates include government policy on visas for non-EEA workers on inshore fishing vessels (9.30am) led by the Scottish Conservative, Douglas Ross. He warns a shortage of labour is reaching critical levels with some boats being sold and others tied up as crew are simply unavailable. He wants the government to reinstate a previous system allowing non-EEA residents to work on fishing boats.Labour MP Kate Green leads a debate on homelessness among refugees (2.30pm) and the Conservative Mark Pritchard has a debate (4.30pm) on Nordstream 2 - the new export gas pipeline running from Russia to Europe across the Baltic Sea.My committee pick is the Education hearing (9.30am) with Apprenticeships and Skills Minister Anne Milton, who will be questioned by her immediate predecessor the committee chair, Robert Halfon.Not on the committee corridor, the Treasury Committee has a hearing (9am) on the Bank of England's Financial Stability Report (published twice a year looking at the state of the financial system), where the chief witnesses is the Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, and Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive, Andrew Bailey. Unusually, possibly uniquely, this will be held at Farnborough Air Show, because the committee accepted an invitation to attend and meet business leaders.In the Lords (2.30pm), question time includes a call for an inquiry into the implementation of the new railway timetables - from Lord Bradshaw. The day's legislating will see peers rattle through a series of bills, starting with the second reading of the Ivory Bill, where there will be pressure for the extension restrictions on trading to other ivory-bearing animals and to tighten up on cybercrime sales of ivory.The Commons opens with Wales questions (11.30am) before the last PMQs before the summer break, at noon.  The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from Labour's Madeleine Moon, is on the definition of terminal illness for social security purposes, and then MPs move to consideration of Lords amendments to the Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Bill.Will MPs remove a Lords amendment to require the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority to develop a relative price cap for suppliers? This would fix the difference between the cheapest rates charged and the most expensive. It is an amendment Labour had previously pushed in the Commons and lost - so expect it to be struck down and the bill returned to the Lords at the end of the day. The main debate is a general debate (ie on a ""neutral motion"") on the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union - essentially it is a chance to discuss the Chequers deal on future customs arrangements and the white paper which embodies it. Which means that ministers could be in for a rough ride. But it will also be worth watching for any possible evolutions in Labour's position - and for any manoeuvres by the small but possibly significant band of Labour Brexiteers. In Westminster Hall debates include: Russia and the Council of Europe (9.30am); progress on protecting victims of domestic abuse in the family courts (2.30pm); the government's 2017 litter strategy and roadside litter (4pm) and NHS whistleblowers and the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (4.30pm).My committee pick is the Liaison Committee hearing with Theresa May (3pm) - where the subjects will be Brexit (inevitably); air quality (the subject of a major joint report by an alliance of select committees); defence spending, where the Defence Committee and the Public Accounts Committee have deep concerns about overstretch in the defence budget; and the ever-controversial multi-billion pound programme for Restoration and Renewal of the Palace of Westminster. In the Lords (3pm) peers polish off the third reading of the Rating (Property in Common Occupation) and Council Tax (Empty Dwellings) Bill, followed by the Northern Ireland Budget (Money) Bill. There is a 90-minute mini-debate on plans to address obesity, followed by ping-pong on Commons amendments to the Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Bill - where the main interest centres around the relative price cap amendment added to the bill by peers a couple of weeks ago - which may well have been struck down by MPs. The Commons opens (9.30am) with Exiting the European Union questions - the new secretary of state, Dominic Raab, has already had a bit of a baptism of fire, after the furious complaints about his failure to provide copies of the Brexit White Paper, when he launched it in the Commons. Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, follows with the weekly Business Statement, which will lay out what MPs will discuss in their first week back, in September, after the Summer recess. Then the Leader will remain at the dispatch box to move a motion to set up the Commons new Independent Complaints and Grievance Policy.  This may not be a simple occasion. Different groups around the Commons have all kinds of concerns about this proposal. Some say it does not go far enough, in that the Commons Standards Committee, dominated by MPs, will remain the ultimate arbiter of complaints. Some fear that the system will touch off a new tsunami of scandals, despite the considerable protection built in for MPs, including anonymity while complaints are investigated. There are concerns that the system of handling complaints could lead to very serious offences being handled in-house, with outright rape being treated as ""sexual misconduct"".That could lead to accusations of cover-up and offenders being eased out, only for Parliament to be accused of cover-up. Others worry that an internal process could lead to MPs, in particular, being convicted and ruined on a ""balance of probability"" standard of proof, which could mean serious injustice. This is unwhipped business at a time when many MPs may be absent, or on early holiday - so the policy will probably be approved. Finally, there will be a general debate on the Tobacco Control Plan.In Westminster Hall (1.30pm) there's a backbench debate on perinatal mental illness, led by Labour's Dr Paul Williams, a GP and the Conservative, Andrew Selous. They say more than half of women suffer a mental health or emotional problem around pregnancy, which can impact on the developing child as well as the mother, and they want to make sure that the routine health checks around pregnancy, particularly the six week check after birth, should include a check on the mother's emotional and mental well-being.  Unusually for a Thursday, there are a couple of committees in action: Environmental Audit (10.15am) quiz foreign office minister Sir Alan Duncan and Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey on the Changing Arctic, while Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs (10.30am) quiz Britain's top civil servant, the acting Cabinet Secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, on his work. In the Lords (11am) the day is devoted to backbench debates. First is on the value to the UK of higher education as an export; and the second on the impact on parliamentary democracy in the UK of the use of referendums. Then come two energy SI approval motions: on the Warm Home discount; and on the Oil and Gas Authority.The Commons is not sitting, but the Lords meets at 10am to debate three private members' bills First is the Conservative Lord Lexden's Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Amendment) (Sibling Couples) Bill which allows siblings aged over 30 years, to register as civil partners if they have lived together for a continuous period of 12 years immediately prior to the date of registration. Then comes the Children Act 1989 (Amendment) (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill which would take court cases on FGM into family court cases, giving them extra confidentiality. This bill comes from the Crossbencher, Lord Berkeley of Knighton.Finally there's the European Union (Information, etc.) Bill - from the Lib Dem (and ex Conservative) Lord Dykes. This would allow information and statistics about the European Union to be made available and promote town twinning arrangements. "

Now they have it, surely they have an opinion about it?As far as official responses go, the most we got from Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, was that he and his colleagues now need time to analyse the White Paper in detail.On the one hand: fair enough. It is a very dense document.But I feel the EU is hiding behind the paper's 98 pages of Brexit tech-talk.In private, EU diplomats make no secret at all of their rejection of large chunks of the White Paper. Brussels has said since the beginning of Brexit negotiations that the UK can't pick and choose the ""best parts"" of EU membership and walk away from the rest when it leaves. Yet that's exactly how the White Paper is interpreted in EU circles.There is no way Michel Barnier will accept it as is.For Theresa May to get that ""deep and special"" access to the EU in trade terms, Brussels will certainly expect more concessions. But EU leaders are biding their time. Trying to calculate not if, but when, and how to get their criticisms across.They're very aware of the febrile political atmosphere in the UK and think if they make a quick comment or criticism of the White Paper, they'd be adding fuel to the fire.So if the EU is so keen for a soft Brexit - (of course we know, deep down, it would prefer no Brexit at all) - what concessions is Brussels prepared to make now to help shore up the prime minister's position in the political maelstrom at home?Worryingly few, is the answer if you're a fan of Theresa May or her White Paper.The EU still believes it holds pretty much all the cards in Brexit negotiations. I don't expect real whiffs of EU concessions before the last minute of the 11th hour this autumn.Can Theresa May hang on till then? And if she can, is she politically strong enough to strike a deal with Brussels and then sell it back home? Frankly, no one knows - and in the meantime, Brussels is stepping up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. Not because the EU or Downing Street wants that - they really do not - but because the time allotted under EU law for a withdrawal agreement to be agreed and signed off by both parties is fast running out. In the meantime, EU diplomats try to sound upbeat: the White Paper is a great springboard from which to re-start face-to-face Brexit negotiations, they say.Those talks begin again behind closed doors on Monday."

Having to play nice with the person you don't have very much in common with, because it's the right thing to do.Knowing that lots of people you DO like would be upset if you don't put on a show. Well, how about this: Having to ""play nice"" publicly with a person you don't have very much in common with, when they have said that the way you are trying to do your job doesn't really work. Add in the embarrassment if they happen to be the leader of the free world. From the moment of his election, Donald Trump was an awkward friend for Theresa May. He runs towards a fight. She does everything in public to avoid one. Well, just before they were due to appear alongside each other on UK soil he publicly, and at length, gave a ""both barrels"" verdict on her most important policy. Her approach to Brexit has been slowly, gently, incrementally, trying to carry the Ming vase across one side of the room to another on a slippery floor.To talk about being pragmatic, to smooth over the contradictions, to do whatever it takes to get to the other side, without smashing that vase (her party and the country) to bits. In walks President Trump, to call out one of the claims that Number 10 has been making of late - in essence, smashing the vase to bits. In an interview with The Sun, he shoots down the chances of a trade deal with the US if she sticks to her carefully crafted compromise Brexit plan. That matters because the government has been clinging to the idea of trade deals with countries outside the EU as one of the benefits of Brexit, and claiming that the choice in the Chequers deal to stay close to the EU doesn't exclude those opportunities. This isn't about what side anyone was on in the referendum. In fact, Remainers and Leavers unite in saying the Chequers deal can't live up to all it claims. For former Remainers, it's nuts to think that trade deals with non-EU countries can ever make up for what might be lost. For some Leavers, it's nuts to claim we can make the most of the world outside if we are still sticking to EU rules. And President Trump drives a bulldozer through the government's central claims about their compromise - that the UK would be able to get decent trade deals with the wider world, while sticking to the EU rules. A lot of this visit has been carefully choreographed, as the prime minister and the president dance around each other. But if the president really wanted to help her build support for her controversial compromise, this isn't the way to do it. "

He added that Europe as a whole was ""losing its culture"" because of immigration from the Middle East and Africa.The Washington Post said Mr Trump had ""blasted"" Mrs May while praising her ""archrival"", former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson who resigned earlier this week over the Brexit plan.The newspaper quoted a US official who said there was ""no way Trump will apologise"" for what he said in the interview but added ""we also don't want to blow everything up"".Another official said President Trump had been privately critical of Mrs May ""for many months"", discussing her vulnerabilities and criticising her political acumen.White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders had told the British government about the interview in advance, ""but thought it would be somewhat more positive"", the newspaper quoted an official as saying.In a statement, Ms Sanders said: ""The President likes and respects Prime Minister May very much. As he said in his interview with The Sun she 'is a very good person' and he 'never said anything bad about her'."" The New York Times said Mr Trump had ""given Mrs May's teetering government a shove"".It said the US president's interview was a ""remarkable breach of protocol"" and, coming after his ""combative"" performance at a Nato meeting in Brussels, amounted to a ""global disruption tour unlike anything undertaken by any other recent American president"".The Politico website described Mr Trump's interview as ""one way to break up a special relationship"".It speculated that Mr Trump may have been ""wound up"" over Brexit by British politician Nigel Farage, the former UK Independence Party leader who campaigned for years for Britain to leave the EU, or that his comments may have been informed by a meeting between his security adviser John Bolton and the ERG, a group of strongly pro-Brexit Conservative Party MPs.But it said the most likely outcome was that Mrs May would suggest that she explain her Brexit plan to Mr Trump, Mr Trump will agree to listen and ""they'll both claim the story was overwritten, and then try to go about their day"".White House correspondents for Axios and the Toronto Star said The Sun had ""over-egged"" Mr Trump's comments apparently ruling out a US-UK trade deal.In a commentary for the Breitbart website, British writer James Delingpole said Mr Trump had ""dropped the mother of all Brexit bombs"" on Mrs May.It ""poured nitroglycerine on an already explosive political issue which threatens to destroy May and possibly even bring down her government"", he said.Mr Delingpole said Mr Trump had placed himself on the side of the ""Brexit resistance"" with the likes of Mr Johnson and Mr Farage and said that his ""outrageous, protocol breaching intervention"" had ""infuriated the liberal elite"".""For the majority of British people who support Brexit, this could scarcely have come at a more welcome or desperate time,"" Mr Delingpole said.Former US ambassador to the EU Anthony Gardner tweeted that it was ""unprecedented to attack ally during state visit"" and said Mr Trump was ""out of control and an embarrassment"".On CNN, Stephen Collinson also said Mr Trump had detonated a ""Brexit bomb"" and delivered an ""astonishing political knifing"" to Mrs May.It was just the latest instance of Mr Trump, ""who cosies up to foreign strongmen like Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, insulting or criticising an allied leader"", Mr Collinson said.The blog Red State said it would be ""interesting to see how the Brits react to this"".The US ""would not be thrilled if such conditions were put on us after a vote of the whole country"", it said. ""How a country deals with other countries in trade is their business,"" it added.US political website The Hill also focused on Mr Trump's comments about ""millions and millions of people"" coming to Europe from the Middle East and Africa.It said they reprised ""a line that he had frequently used on the campaign trail - that Europe was being overrun by non-Europeans and was quickly becoming a shell of what it once was"".The Hill noted that migration levels to Europe had declined since 2015, when more than a million people, many fleeing the Syrian civil war and other conflicts, arrived.Fox News said Mr Trump's comments were a ""body blow"" to Mrs May's government."
2018-07-16,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180716224724/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-16,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180716224724/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Ms Swinson, a Remain supporter who has recently given birth and was unable to vote, tweeted Mr Lewis did not keep to their arrangement to balance out her effective abstention - known as ""pairing"" - and accused the government of ""desperate stuff"".They didn't escape defeat for long.Having squeaked through last night the government was beaten for only the second time ever in the Commons on key Brexit legislation.And guess what, it was on a vote they didn't expect to lose - Dr Phillip Lee, who quit the government to speak out on Brexit, put forward his own amendment to protect the links between the UK and the European Medicines Agency to ensure the smooth flow of medicines and new drugs for British patients after Brexit.And he had enough to support to win it, just. An embarrassment for the government certainly.It is another reminder of how difficult it is for Theresa May to get her way in the House of Commons where she doesn't have her own majority. It is serious. A defeat is a problem. But it wasn't a complete disaster tonight for two reasons.First, the amendment isn't a million miles away from the government's own policy. While not straightforward, the vote hasn't forced a screeching U-turn.The more important reason is that the vote that followed, on keeping the UK in a customs union, went the other way.Read Laura's blogThe vote on medicine regulation was only the government's second defeat on Brexit in the House of Commons.MPs voted for the UK to take ""all necessary steps"" to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency after it leaves the EU.The agency, which evaluates and supervises medicines and helps national authorities authorise the sale of drugs across the EU, is currently based in London but is moving to Amsterdam after Brexit.There have been warnings that Brexit may cause delays in UK patients getting new drugs.The government says it is ""seeking participation"" in the agency after Brexit and would make an ""appropriate financial contribution"" in return.But it has not agreed to take ""all necessary steps"" to secure this.Responding to the defeat, the government said: ""We will now reflect on this amendment and seek to revisit in the Lords."""
2018-07-17,Maternity leave MP accuses Tories over vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20180717224650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44867866,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAn MP who is on maternity leave has accused the government of a breach of trust over a key House of Commons vote on Brexit.Lib Dem Jo Swinson was ""paired"" with Tory chairman Brandon Lewis so she could be at home with her baby son during the Trade Bill vote.This should mean neither MP votes so their absences cancel each other out.But Mr Lewis did vote with the government - he has since apologised for an ""honest mistake"" by whips.The Tory chief whip also apologised.The row blew up after voting had taken place on the Trade Bill, where the main battleground was an amendment to do with staying in the customs union if the UK fails to agree a trade deal with the EU.The Lib Dems voted against the government alongside Labour, the SNP and some pro-EU Tories, but the government won by 307 to 301.Pairing is an informal arrangement between two MPs of opposing parties that allows them, with the agreement of the Whips, the MPs responsible for party discipline, to miss occasional votes in the House.If two members from opposite sides of the House both agree to miss a vote, then by agreeing to differ they would cancel out each other's vote, so neither member need turn up.Ms Swinson, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats and MP for East Dunbartonshire, gave birth to her second son Gabriel on 29 June.She said she had been told Mr Lewis would be her ""pair"" for the votes on the Trade Bill.Mr Lewis did not take part in most of the day's Trade Bill votes, but did take part in the two closest divisions - the one on customs and another on medicine regulation, which the government lost.Just how low will your govt stoop @theresa_may? When @andrealeadsom delayed proxy voting motions, she *assured* those of us who were pregnant that we would be paired when necessary.

I know how important the pair is to everyone, especially new parents, and I apologise.""Conservative chief whip Julian Smith said Mr Lewis had been ""asked to vote in error"".Labour's Harriet Harman said the episode highlighted the need to allow MPs on parenting leave to nominate a proxy on their behalf.The Commons backed this principle earlier this year and a committee of MPs has put forward recommendations for how it might work."
2018-07-17,Vote Leave campaign broke electoral law,https://web.archive.org//web/20180717224650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44856992,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBrexit campaign group Vote Leave has been fined £61,000 and referred to the police after an Electoral Commission probe said it broke electoral law.The watchdog said it exceeded its £7m spending limit by funnelling £675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave.The founder of BeLeave, Darren Grimes, has been fined £20,000 and referred to the police, along with Vote Leave official David Halsall.Vote Leave said the ""wholly inaccurate"" report was politically motivated. The Vote Leave campaign, which was fronted by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, won the contest to be the official Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum on whether Britain should stay in the European Union.The result of the referendum was 51.9% for Leave and 48.1% for Remain. The UK is due to officially leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019.The referendum was not legally binding, merely ""advisory,"" according to a Supreme Court judgement in December 2016, so it can't be ordered to be re-run by a court - any decision to have a fresh referendum would have to be made by the government and Parliament would have to pass a referendum act.The Electoral Commission has referred Mr Grimes and Mr Halsall to the Metropolitan Police in relation to false declarations of campaign spending, and handed over files ""in relation to whether any persons have committed related offences"" that fall outside the watchdog's remit. Vote Leave and the official Remain campaign Britain Stronger in Europe were allowed to spend £7m each on campaigning in the run up to the referendum.Vote Leave spent nearly £2.7m of its £7m budget on the services of a Canadian digital marketing firm, Aggregate IQ. A further £675,315 was sent to Aggregate IQ by BeLeave, a group set up by Mr Grimes, then a fashion student at Brighton university.The money came from Vote Leave which has said in the past it was told by the Electoral Commission it was allowed to do this because BeLeave was a separate campaign group.But the Electoral Commission - which is the watchdog overseeing elections in the UK and ensuring that UK laws on spending by political parties are followed - has ruled that the two groups were working together and Mr Grimes had ""wrongly"" reported the spending as his own.This meant that, including this amount, the Electoral Commission says Vote Leave spent £7,449,079, breaching its £7m spending limit.Darren Grimes is also said to have exceeded the £10,000 he was allowed to spend as a non-registered campaigner, the watchdog said.Bob Posner, from the Electoral Commission, said: ""We found substantial evidence that the two groups worked to a common plan, did not declare their joint working and did not adhere to the legal spending limits. These are serious breaches of the laws put in place by Parliament to ensure fairness and transparency at elections and referendums.""He added: ""Vote Leave has resisted our investigation from the start, including contesting our right as the statutory regulator to open the investigation. It has refused to cooperate, refused our requests to put forward a representative for interview, and forced us to use our legal powers to compel it to provide evidence.""Nevertheless, the evidence we have found is clear and substantial, and can now be seen in our report.""It is impossible to say how overspending by the Vote Leave campaign affected the referendum result. It all went to one marketing firm, which developed highly-targeted Facebook advertising. In a quote since removed from the Aggregate IQ website, Vote Leave campaign director Dominic Cummings said: ""We couldn't have done it without them.""Former Vote Leave activist Shahmir Sanni, who went public with allegations about overspending earlier this year, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One the extra cash spent by BeLeave had affected the referendum outcome - saying such a sum ""can make all the difference"".Anti-Brexit Labour peer Lord Adonis said Vote Leave's overspending ""could have been decisive"" in the 2016 referendum because it was a close result but he did not want to re-run that campaign.Instead, he said ""all of those responsible for this breach of the law"" should be ""barred"" from playing any part in any future referendum, such as the one he is calling for on the final Brexit deal.Labour is calling for Tory ministers who were key figures in Vote Leave to be referred to the cabinet secretary to determine whether they had broken the ministerial code.In a statement on Twitter, Mr Grimes said it was ""incredible"" that he had been fined £20,000 ""on the basis of the wrong box being ticked on an application form"".He said he had been interviewed by the Electoral Commission during two previous investigations and had never been ""provided with particulars"" of the allegation that he had worked on a ""common plan"" with Vote Leave so that he could ""make representations about it"".""Politicians say they want young people to engage with politics. I was 22 when I got involved in a referendum I felt passionately about. I did nothing wrong,"" he added. ""I have been persecuted for over two years by powerful people for nothing more than engaging in the democratic process and having the temerity to be on the winning side. It has been appalling for my family.""I’m shocked and disappointed by the Electoral Commission and their behaviour. They have put me and my family of very ordinary means through hell for two years and seek to justify this by saying that I failed a box ticking exercise — why has this taken them three investigations?End of Twitter post  by @darrengrimes_The Electoral Commission cleared Vote Leave of breaking spending limits in March last year but re-opened its investigation in October, saying new evidence had come to light from its own investigations, media reports, academics and whistleblowers. Another pro-Brexit group, Veterans for Britain, was also found to have inaccurately reported a donation it received from Vote Leave and has been fined £250.Vote Leave also returned an ""incomplete and inaccurate spending report"", with almost £234,501 reported incorrectly, and invoices missing for £12,849.99 of spending, the watchdog said. A Vote Leave spokesman said: ""The Electoral Commission's report contains a number of false accusations and incorrect assertions that are wholly inaccurate and do not stand up to scrutiny.""It is astonishing that nobody from Vote Leave has been interviewed by the commission in the production of this report, nor indeed at any point in the past two years. Yet the commission has interviewed the so-called 'whistleblowers' who have no knowledge of how Vote Leave operated and whose credibility has been seriously called into question.""Vote Leave has provided evidence to the Electoral Commission proving there was no wrongdoing. And yet despite clear evidence of wrongdoing by the Remain campaign, the commission has chosen to ignore this and refused to launch an investigation. ""All this suggests that the supposedly impartial commission is motivated by a political agenda rather than uncovering the facts.""The commission has failed to follow due process, and in doing so has based its conclusions on unfounded claims and conspiracy theories.""We will consider the options available to us, but are confident that these findings will be overturned.""The Electoral Commission hit back at allegations of political bias, saying: ""We open investigations where the evidence justifies it, irrespective of the political views of the party or campaigner concerned."" It also insisted it had followed ""due process"" and had spent three months and made five attempts to interview Vote Leave representatives. Months into the investigation, ""certain Vote Leave staff members came to us separately and offered to be interviewed"", an Electoral Commission source said, but by that point it had gathered enough evidence to conclude that an offence had occurred.Asked whether it believed the referendum result was still valid, No 10 said the public delivered a ""clear verdict"" which the government was in the process of implementing.But speaking in the Commons, former Tory home secretary Amber Rudd said ministers should not use this to ""obfuscate"" from its duty to protect the electoral system from abuses. And Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, who voted to remain, called for the referendum to be re-run. A separate Brexit campaign, Leave.EU, was fined £70,000 in March for failing to declare ""at least"" £77,380 it spent on referendum campaigning.Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney was referred to the police following the commission's investigation. Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks called it a ""politically motivated attack"" and said he would take the watchdog to court.Leave.EU, which was fronted by then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage, was only allowed to spend £700,000 in the run up to the referendum, after losing out to Vote Leave in the battle to designated the official Leave campaign.The official Remain campaign Britain Stronger in Europe, was fined £1,250 in December last year for not providing invoices and for declaring some spending in aggregate rather than individual payments."

It states ""anti-Semitism is racism. It is unacceptable in our party and in wider society"".But it does not fully repeat the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism.On Monday evening, the Parliamentary Labour Party - MPs and peers - voted overwhelmingly for the full IHRA definition to be adopted.  Labour's code, which was approved by a sub-committee of its National Executive Committee (NEC) earlier this month, was drawn up following the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry into anti-Semitism.The NEC rubber-stamped the new code when it met on Tuesday.But a Labour spokesperson added: ""In recognition of the serious concerns expressed, the NEC agreed to re-open the development of the code, in consultation with Jewish community organisations and groups, in order to better reflect their views.""The code does endorse the IHRA's working definition of anti-Semitism and includes behaviours it lists as likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples from that definition:The chief rabbi said Labour would be ""on the wrong side"" of the fight against racism unless it toughened up its stance.   Labour MP Wes Streeting, co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on British Jews, said the message the new code sends to Britain's Jewish community was ""utterly contemptible"". ""The damage it will inflict on our credibility as an anti-racist political party is the leadership's responsibility - and theirs alone,"" he added. He said he would be ""meeting urgently with our friends in the Jewish Labour Movement to discuss next steps, as this decision cannot go unchallenged"". "

The government could have been defeated, as a number of Conservative backbenchers were against the motion, as well as Labour and the SNP. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Bercow said his ""strong sense"" was that ""the status quo applies"" and that Parliament would sit next Monday and Tuesday ""as had always been the intention"". ""We were always expecting to sit until next Tuesday, that's what our electors would have expected,"" he added. ""The government was perfectly within its rights, though it was pretty unusual suddenly to suggest a change, but the government appears to have thought again about that matter.""

The Tory MP wrote his first column for the Daily Telegraph on Monday, a week after he quit as foreign secretary.Ex-ministers must refer new employment to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments before accepting it. The watchdog said it had not heard from him, leading one MP to claim Mr Johnson had broken the ministerial code.Under existing guidelines, ex-cabinet ministers normally have to wait three months from their last day in office before taking up any outside employment.Ex-ministers are expected to observe a two-year ban on lobbying government on behalf of any new employer or clients.The watchdog said it had not had any contact with Mr Johnson. ""Ministers are written to when they leave office to remind them of their responsibility to make an application to us,"" it said.Mr Johnson, who was Brussels correspondent for the Daily Telegraph before he entered politics, wrote a weekly column for the paper for many years but stopped when he became foreign secretary in July 2016. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said its resumption so soon after Mr Johnson quit office left both him and the watchdog with questions to answer.""The worst Boris faces for this disgraceful behaviour is just a slap on the wrist,"" she said. ""That is disgraceful. Boris has broken the rules yet again, for once he should pay the price for his actions.""If the watchdog doesn't bark, is it time to put it down?""The watchdog, which published its annual report on Tuesday, does not have the power to block appointments or take action against politicians who do not observe its rules - leading to claims it is powerless to stop a ""revolving door"" between government and business.Last year, however, it criticised former chancellor George Osborne for accepting the post of editor of the Evening Standard before getting its advice.

2018-07-17,"I had no choice but to quit, says Bebb",https://web.archive.org//web/20180717224650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-44863921,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA Welsh Conservative MP has said he had no choice but to resign over Theresa May's concessions to Brexiteers.Guto Bebb resigned as minister for defence procurement to vote against the government on amendments it accepted to its Brexit Customs Bill on Monday.He told BBC Wales the ""wrecking amendments"" had undermined Mrs May's position in negotiations with Brussels.Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said he was ""very sorry"" the Aberconwy MP felt he had to quit over the issue.   The government avoided defeat by three votes on two amendments, and was accused of ""caving in"" to the Tory party's Eurosceptic MPs.Downing Street accepted four amendments altogether, saying they were ""consistent"" with the government's position on how it wanted to trade with the EU in years to come.On Tuesday, Mr Bebb said Brexiteer's ""wrecking amendments"" had been put forward ""with a simple intention of damaging the Chequers agreement"", the blueprint for future relations with the EU the prime minister agreed with cabinet earlier this month. ""When the government were not willing to compromise on this issue I felt that I had no choice because ultimately I wanted to send the prime minister to talk to the European Commission, to negotiate with the European Commission, from a position of strength with the party united behind her,"" he said.""I think the ERG [pro-Brexit Conservative European Research Group] amendments yesterday have absolutely undermined the negotiating position that the prime minister had and I felt duty bound to try and vote to highlight the fact that the Conservative Party should be led by the prime minister not by the leadership of the ERG group.""I'm disappointed that that point wasn't made last night with a victory in the vote in question."" MPs backed an amendment preventing the UK collecting taxes on behalf of the EU unless the rest of the EU does the same for the UK.Applying EU tariffs to products destined for the EU is part of Mrs May's plan to avoid friction at UK borders after Brexit.Another amendment, to ensure the UK is out of the EU's VAT regime, was backed by 303 to 300.Mr Bebb was appointed minister for defence procurement in January 2018 after serving as parliamentary under secretary of state at the Wales Office and a government whip from March 2016.Following his departure from government, he warned his whole party could go the same way if its divisions continued. ""I think the Conservative Party needs to think very carefully as to what will be the impact on the United Kingdom if we ended up with a Marxist Labour government intent upon some of the policies which are being supported by Jeremy Corbyn and his Labour leadership,"" he said.""There are some in the party who are more intent on the concept of ideological purity on a Brexit which most people didn't vote for. ""Most people voted to leave the European Union not for a termination of our relationship with the EU.""Mr Bebb had staunchly defended the prime minister amid the turmoil which has followed the Chequers agreement, branding Boris Johnson's resignation as foreign secretary ""a selfish act"" and attacking former Brexit Minister David Jones for criticising Mrs May's plan.Earlier on Tuesday Mr Cairns told BBC Radio Wales he was ""going to miss"" Mr Bebb, who had served under him as a junior Wales Office minister.Speaking on Good Morning Wales, he said: ""Guto was an excellent minister and a close colleague and a good friend. ""I'm very sorry that he felt in order to vote last night that he needed to leave the government."" Clwyd West MP David Jones - a former Brexit minister and Welsh secretary who led the Vote Leave campaign in Wales - said the government was right to listen to its Brexiteer critics but believed ""a lot more listening"" needed to be done. Guto Bebb told me he was increasingly concerned about the power of Brexiteers over the prime minister.He believes the government bowed to pressure when it didn't necessarily need to, which leads him to question who actually leads the party now, Theresa May or a hard-core group of Brexit supporters. The government insists that the amendments change nothing, but Mr Bebb told me that was ""nonsense"" and he now had real concerns about Mrs May's ability to negotiate a deal with the European Union. The party's internal feud over Europe is worrying the former minister, who has serious concerns about the party's future if members don't become more pragmatic in their outlook about Brexit. "

He told BBC News the Commons chamber was the ""fulcrum"" of British democracy and should only ever be used by elected parliamentarians.""Even if you are a member of the House of Lords, you cannot sit on our green benches at any time,"" Sir Christopher told the BBC. The one exception to this rule was the Youth Parliament, he added, which is allowed to use the chamber for debates one day a year because its members are elected.He was criticised by shadow women and equalities minister Dawn Butler who said Theresa May needed to ""to call out this sexist behaviour in her own party"".Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle said on Twitter: ""Once with upskirting is foolish but twice might lead to accusations of him being a misogynist!""Sir Christopher said claims of misogyny levelled at him were ""all lies"" and he would not be deterred from holding the government to account for ""lazy"" and poorly thought-out laws.""I have always been keen to ask questions - that is a key part of our democracy,"" he said.He said he had been through a ""torrid period trying to get to the truth"" about the upskirting bill but had now been ""fully vindicated"" because MPs had tabled a string of amendments to the government's bill over fears it will not be effective.The government said it would give top priority to creating a new criminal offence of taking a photograph underneath a person's skirt after Sir Christopher blocked a bill by Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse.Maria Miller, chairwoman of the Women and Equalities Committee, last week warned against rushing the Voyeurism (Offences) (No. 2) Bill  through parliament because ""we could end up with a piece of legislation that is not doing what the government set out for it to do, which is to close a loophole in the law"".""What really concerns me is that perpetrators could easily plead that they were taking images not for sexual gratification, but anonymously for sale to a third party,"" she told MPs.""That could actually give perpetrators a very big loophole to climb through."""

It also questioned how much of the supposed Brexit dividend would end up going towards the extra commitment to the NHS in England.The OBR estimates that the UK would have had to make a contribution of £13.3bn to the EU budget in 2022-23 if it remained a member.It said of that potential saving, £7.5bn would be absorbed by the withdrawal settlement payment expected for that year, ""leaving £5.8bn to be spent on other things"".The OBR said that, in principle, it would cover slightly less than 30% of the cost of health package in that year.""This does not take into account other calls on these potential savings, including commitments the government has already made on farm support, structural funds, science and access to regulatory bodies,"" it added. ""Pending a detailed withdrawal agreement and associated spending decisions, we assume in this report that the extra health spending adds to total spending and borrowing rather than being absorbed in whole or part elsewhere.""In its response, the Treasury reiterated Mrs May's promise that the NHS boost ""will be partly funded by lower contributions due to the European Union"".""In addition, she has made clear that taxpayers will need to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way. This will also require prioritisation and further efficiencies within non-health expenditure to keep the growth in total spending on a sustainable long-run trajectory,"" it said. The OBR said: ""The main lesson of our analysis is that future governments are likely to have to undertake some additional tightening beyond the fiscal plans in place for the next five years in order to address the fiscal costs of an ageing population and upward pressures on health spending.""Leaving all or part of the June 2018 health spending announcement unfunded would simply require greater action later."""

Some analysts said the slowdown in wage growth could dampen expectations of an interest rate rise next month. Wage growth is one of the key figures that the Bank of England monitors to assess the health of the UK economy.Including bonuses, wage growth fell to 2.5% from 2.6% over the same period, the ONS said.The proportion of people in work rose to a record high of 75.7%.""We've had yet another record employment rate, while the number of job vacancies is also a new record,"" said ONS statistician Matt Hughes.  ""From this, it's clear that the labour market is still growing strongly.""The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee meets on 2 August to decide whether to raise interest rates from their current level of 0.5%.At their last meeting in June, the nine-member MPC was split 6-3, with dissenters calling for a quarter-point rise to 0.75%.Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, called the latest figures on wages and jobs ""mildly disappointing"".""All in all, these numbers don't alter the economic picture of anaemic growth, a relatively tight labour market and under-control inflation,"" he said. ""Markets are still expecting the Bank of England to raise interest rates in August. But given the increasingly uncertain climate, I think there's a real chance policymakers will sit on their hands and wait for firmer signals the economy is on the right track before risking raising borrowing costs.""However, Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, said he did not think the latest data would deter the Bank from raising rates.""The recent easing in wage growth looks unlikely to be sustained,"" he said.""Leading indicators of pay suggest that it is on track to at least meet the Bank of England's forecast for underlying wage growth of 2.75% y/y in Q4. As such, we continue to expect the MPC to vote to raise interest rates next month.""Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said the latest slowdown in pay growth was ""disappointing"".""This means that earnings growth in real terms remains in positive territory by just a small margin and so is unlikely to provide much of a boost to consumer spending power,"" he said.""While we expect that interest rates will rise sooner rather than later, with earnings growth underwhelming, there remains sufficient scope for the MPC to keep a rates hike on hold for longer, particularly given the current economic and political uncertainty.""Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Clamour for an August interest rate rise has been building, but the sluggish pay growth should give pause for thought.The Bank should pay heed to the array of obstacles standing in the way of firms, from the burden of business rates to Brexit uncertainty, when it comes to making its decision."""

The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade.UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States.Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world.But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops.  The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019.To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. Leading EU figures have hinted that Brexit could be halted. It would need all the other EU member states to agree.A less formal version of this option would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue.The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - including Justine Greening.With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.Please upgrade your browser"

But how often do the UK's MPs meet compared with politicians in other countries?They have a long summer holiday - spending six weeks away from Westminster, dealing with constituents' concerns and, just maybe, getting away from it all. So, how often are MPs expected, or at least able, to attend debates and votes?During the last complete parliamentary session, 2016-17, the House of Commons sat on 142 days. During the previous session - 2015-16 - the number was 158.Commons sessions vary in length, sometimes shortened by elections or elongated by the lack of a State Opening of Parliament (during which the Queen's Speech sets out the government's legislative programme). But the 2015-16 and 2016-17 sessions each lasted just under a year, making them roughly comparable with more regularly sitting chambers elsewhere in the world.Different legislative bodies compile and present their schedules in different ways, and they have different lengths of working days. But we can at least say the UK's number of sitting days is among the biggest we've come across.The calendar for the US House of Representatives shows its members are scheduled to sit for 124 days this calendar year. In 2017, it was 145 days.Japan's House of Representatives usually meets on 150 days a year.In Canada this year, the House of Commons is scheduled to sit on 127 days.Meanwhile, in Germany's Bundestag, it's compulsory for members to attend on sitting days. This year, there are 104 of those.Of course, the work of a politician can't be measured entirely in terms of how often they attend a debating chamber.""It's a common misconception that MPs only work on those days when Parliament is sitting,"" says Alice Lilly, leading parliamentary monitor at the Institute for Government. ""When the Commons is in recess MPs still do a variety of other work, such as attending events, making visits, or conducting surgeries in their constituencies.""And MPs who are ministers will still have ministerial responsibilities to deal with during recess, in addition to their constituency work.""While in the UK there's debate over whether MPs spend enough time in Parliament, in India Westminster's politicians are sometimes held up as an example of hard workers. Earlier this year, the Communist Party of India cited them as it sought to bring in a law ensuring Parliament sits for at least 100 days.Another member of the sub-100 club is New Zealand. Its House of Representatives is scheduled to meet for 93 days this year.That's more than the 65 days on which Australia's own House of Representatives is to meet.But this is not the smallest number of attendance days we found.The almost-3,000-member National People's Congress of China - regarded by Western observers as little more than a ""rubber stamp"" for Communist Party decisions - gets together only once a year. And its most recent session, in March, lasted just over two weeks.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

Writing in the Times, Justine Greening, who used to be education secretary, argued that another vote would be ""the only way to end deadlock"".But how, in practice, could a second vote happen?The government has ruled out a new Brexit referendum and the Labour party says it's unlikely - although its Shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, says it is sensible to keep ""all our options on the table"" - in the event of Parliament voting down a Brexit deal or in the case of a ""no deal"" scenario.Downing Street said, in response to Ms Greening, that a referendum will not happen ""in any circumstances"".So unless there is a dramatic change in party policy, it's highly unlikely a referendum would be called in the first place.That's because a referendum requires an Act of Parliament, which needs to be voted through by the majority of MPs.And while there are vocal supporters on all sides, currently there are not enough MPs who support the idea of a second referendum.Even if MPs and peers agreed in principle to hold a second referendum, the legislative process can be drawn out.Parliament would need to pass detailed rules for the conduct of the poll and the regulation of campaigners.It took  seven months before Parliament signed off the previous referendum legislation in 2015. Further time was also needed to pass secondary legislation on areas such as voting registration.In theory, Parliament could copy over some of the legislation from the 2015 Act in order to try to speed the process up. But according to David Jeffery, a politics lecturer at Liverpool University, this might not save a lot of time because issues would still need to be debated and scrutinised by MPs and Lords.Aside from the time to pass the legislation, there's also the length of the campaign to consider.Last time around there was a four-month period between the then Prime Minister David Cameron announcing the referendum in February 2016, and the vote taking place on 23 June.Furthermore, the Electoral Commission has recommended that in future there should be at least a six-month gap between legislation being passed and a referendum being held.That's to allow enough time to register campaigns, put counting officers in place and give people information on how to vote.So combining the time to pass the legislation and allowing for a campaign, it might not be possible to hold a second referendum before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU in March 2019 (i.e. when the Article 50 process is due to expire).And holding a referendum after the Article 50 process could cause a number of practical problems.For one, what if the country voted to remain in the EU, but had already left by the time the vote was held?This could be avoided if the EU agreed to extend the Article 50 deadline - but this would need to be unanimously agreed by all EU member states.There's also the referendum question itself and the options on the ballot paper to consider.These need to be presented ""clearly, simply and neutrally"", according to the Electoral Commission. Justine Greening argues for three options: accept a negotiated Brexit deal, stay in the EU, or leave with no deal.David Jeffery says having more than a yes/no option could complicate the process:""With three options you could have a situation where just 34% decide the winning option. ""And that leads to questions about the type of voting system you want - like choosing the options by preference order,"" he says.""But then you need to ask 'do the public understand the system and how might it work in such a short period of time?'""In the end it would be up to the Electoral Commission to assess that question.

2018-07-17,Week ahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20180717224650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-44832598,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDoes the Government have a Commons majority anymore? Next week we will see the first post-Chequers test of whether disgruntled Brexiteer Tories, deeply unhappy with what they see as the PM's soft-boiled version of leaving the EU, will still toe the party line.For the last few months the Conservative whips have been seeking to fend off a threat on their Remain flank, posed by a group of up to 20 backbencher arguing for the softest possible Brexit; suddenly the threat comes from 60 to 80 Brexiteers. And unlike the Remainers, who have the air of refugee aristocrats, struggling to master the insurgent arts, they are mostly habitual rebels, case hardened by the battles of the Major and Cameron years. In short, the threat confronting the Chief Whip, Julian Smith, is suddenly orders of magnitude greater - and that was before President Trump added his few dimes' worth to the debate.One of the big determinants of Mr Smith's problems will be the conversations his flock will be having with their Conservative constituency associations over the weekend which will dictate the tone of the coming week; will MPs detect a yearning for unity from their troops, or a burning sense of Brexit betrayal? If the latter, all kinds of mayhem will follow - enough letters could be submitted to the Chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, to trigger a confidence vote in Theresa May. There might be more resignations, and a serious warning shot or two at the government in the votes due on the Customs and Trade bills, which are due for report stage consideration on Monday and Tuesday. Theresa May herself will have PMQs, and an appearance before the Liaison Committee, which will give her Tory critics a chance to vent at her. And she might also find herself fielding urgent questions in the backwash of the Trump visit and the NATO summit. Then there's Boris. Will the former Foreign Secretary, emboldened by presidential praise, seek to take his case to the Commons? I have no information one way or another, but next week provides a wealth of opportunities. He could speak in the debates on the Trade or Customs bills, or in Wednesday's general EU debate. Or he could opt for a full-dress resignation statement in the manner of Geoffrey Howe. Angry ex-colleagues can inflict near mortal wounds on Prime Ministers - Geoffrey Howe's evisceration of Margaret Thatcher in 1990 remains the classic example, although based on the opposite view of the EU. Or there was Norman Lamont's devastating attack on John Major - ""in office but not in power"". But for maximum effect, the resignee needs a packed House and the presence of his target, so the cameras can cut to her expression as each barb hits home - so a resignation statement after PMQs, giving the Prime Minister little opportunity to escape, and no opportunity to reply, looks to be the way to inflict maximum damage. Again, I emphasise, this is pure speculation in the absence of actual data - but hey.The Commons opens (2.30pm) with Home Office Questions - and any post-weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions (a reportback on the Nato summit, perhaps) to follow at 3.30pm. Then comes the first of the week's two big Brexit bills, the Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Bill - the report stage of this measure has been postponed for quite a while, for fear of a Tory Remainer ambush, but now, there's a new threat in the shape of four new amendments from Brexiteers: there are some pointed Brexiteer amendments - and even some chuntering that some Tory MPs might oppose the bill at third reading, to register a protest at the government's Brexit policy. Brexiteer and former Cabinet minister Priti Patel has new clause 36 which requires that HMRC won't collect other countries' tariffs unless there is a reciprocal arrangement; Bernard Jenkin's amendment 72 says the government will not be able to use powers to implement a customs union without a separate piece of legislation; Craig Mackinley's amendment 73 says the government will have to commit to having a separate VAT system to the EU, and Lawrence Robertson wants to rule out a customs border in the Irish Sea.Brexiteers are toying with a ""proof of life"" amendment to remove ministers powers to enact ""a"" customs union with the EU, on the argument that this is an option ruled out by the Chequers deal. In Westminster Hall there's a Petitions Committee debate on e-petition 222419: ""Reject calls to add Staffordshire Bull Terriers to the Dangerous Dogs Act.""In the Lords from 2.30 pm, there's a question on permitting the use of cannabis oil on prescription from the Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard.The main legislating is the second reading of the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill. Here, the key issue concerns the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards for people lacking mental capacity, who are detained for treatment in care homes or hospitals. The final business of the day is a short debate on maximising the income from the National Lottery and its use for the arts and good causes.The Commons opens (11.30am) with Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy questions. Will BEIS Secretary Greg Clark, seen as a key cabinet voice arguing for the softest possible Brexit, be targeted by hard Brexiteers on his own side?Then comes an intriguing Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative Giles Watling, who wants to regulate anti-loitering devices which emit a loud and painful sound that can only be heard by certain age groups, including children and teenagers. This sound is annoying to the point where people cannot stay in the area. But he believes they are not the right answer to anti-social behaviour, and only drive the problem elsewhere. So he proposes introducing a licence, regulated by a local authority. The day's main event will be the report and third reading stages of the Trade Bill - a Brexit measure designed to establish a framework for UK international trade, outside the EU institutions which have regulated it since 1972. Recent events may have taken the heat out of the ""Soubry"" amendment to keep the UK in ""a"" customs union with the EU.  There are several amendments along these lines from various different sources - but normally it's the rebel Conservative amendments which are most dangerous to the government. And the government has put down a raft of changes to meet concerns about excessive ministerial power.In Westminster Hall debates include government policy on visas for non-EEA workers on inshore fishing vessels (9.30am) led by the Scottish Conservative, Douglas Ross. He warns a shortage of labour is reaching critical levels with some boats being sold and others tied up as crew are simply unavailable. He wants the government to reinstate a previous system allowing non-EEA residents to work on fishing boats.Labour MP Kate Green leads a debate on homelessness among refugees (2.30pm) and the Conservative Mark Pritchard has a debate (4.30pm) on Nordstream 2 - the new export gas pipeline running from Russia to Europe across the Baltic Sea.My committee pick is the Education hearing (9.30am) with Apprenticeships and Skills Minister Anne Milton, who will be questioned by her immediate predecessor the committee chair, Robert Halfon.Not on the committee corridor, the Treasury Committee has a hearing (9am) on the Bank of England's Financial Stability Report (published twice a year looking at the state of the financial system), where the chief witnesses is the Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, and Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive, Andrew Bailey. Unusually, possibly uniquely, this will be held at Farnborough Air Show, because the committee accepted an invitation to attend and meet business leaders.In the Lords (2.30pm), question time includes a call for an inquiry into the implementation of the new railway timetables - from Lord Bradshaw. The day's legislating will see peers rattle through a series of bills, starting with the second reading of the Ivory Bill, where there will be pressure for the extension restrictions on trading to other ivory-bearing animals and to tighten up on cybercrime sales of ivory.The Commons opens with Wales questions (11.30am) before the last PMQs before the summer break, at noon.  The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from Labour's Madeleine Moon, is on the definition of terminal illness for social security purposes, and then MPs move to consideration of Lords amendments to the Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Bill.Will MPs remove a Lords amendment to require the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority to develop a relative price cap for suppliers? This would fix the difference between the cheapest rates charged and the most expensive. It is an amendment Labour had previously pushed in the Commons and lost - so expect it to be struck down and the bill returned to the Lords at the end of the day. The main debate is a general debate (ie on a ""neutral motion"") on the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union - essentially it is a chance to discuss the Chequers deal on future customs arrangements and the white paper which embodies it. Which means that ministers could be in for a rough ride. But it will also be worth watching for any possible evolutions in Labour's position - and for any manoeuvres by the small but possibly significant band of Labour Brexiteers. In Westminster Hall debates include: Russia and the Council of Europe (9.30am); progress on protecting victims of domestic abuse in the family courts (2.30pm); the government's 2017 litter strategy and roadside litter (4pm) and NHS whistleblowers and the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (4.30pm).My committee pick is the Liaison Committee hearing with Theresa May (3pm) - where the subjects will be Brexit (inevitably); air quality (the subject of a major joint report by an alliance of select committees); defence spending, where the Defence Committee and the Public Accounts Committee have deep concerns about overstretch in the defence budget; and the ever-controversial multi-billion pound programme for Restoration and Renewal of the Palace of Westminster. In the Lords (3pm) peers polish off the third reading of the Rating (Property in Common Occupation) and Council Tax (Empty Dwellings) Bill, followed by the Northern Ireland Budget (Money) Bill. There is a 90-minute mini-debate on plans to address obesity, followed by ping-pong on Commons amendments to the Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Bill - where the main interest centres around the relative price cap amendment added to the bill by peers a couple of weeks ago - which may well have been struck down by MPs. The Commons opens (9.30am) with Exiting the European Union questions - the new secretary of state, Dominic Raab, has already had a bit of a baptism of fire, after the furious complaints about his failure to provide copies of the Brexit White Paper, when he launched it in the Commons. Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, follows with the weekly Business Statement, which will lay out what MPs will discuss in their first week back, in September, after the Summer recess. Then the Leader will remain at the dispatch box to move a motion to set up the Commons new Independent Complaints and Grievance Policy.  This may not be a simple occasion. Different groups around the Commons have all kinds of concerns about this proposal. Some say it does not go far enough, in that the Commons Standards Committee, dominated by MPs, will remain the ultimate arbiter of complaints. Some fear that the system will touch off a new tsunami of scandals, despite the considerable protection built in for MPs, including anonymity while complaints are investigated. There are concerns that the system of handling complaints could lead to very serious offences being handled in-house, with outright rape being treated as ""sexual misconduct"".That could lead to accusations of cover-up and offenders being eased out, only for Parliament to be accused of cover-up. Others worry that an internal process could lead to MPs, in particular, being convicted and ruined on a ""balance of probability"" standard of proof, which could mean serious injustice. This is unwhipped business at a time when many MPs may be absent, or on early holiday - so the policy will probably be approved. Finally, there will be a general debate on the Tobacco Control Plan.In Westminster Hall (1.30pm) there's a backbench debate on perinatal mental illness, led by Labour's Dr Paul Williams, a GP and the Conservative, Andrew Selous. They say more than half of women suffer a mental health or emotional problem around pregnancy, which can impact on the developing child as well as the mother, and they want to make sure that the routine health checks around pregnancy, particularly the six week check after birth, should include a check on the mother's emotional and mental well-being.  Unusually for a Thursday, there are a couple of committees in action: Environmental Audit (10.15am) quiz foreign office minister Sir Alan Duncan and Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey on the Changing Arctic, while Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs (10.30am) quiz Britain's top civil servant, the acting Cabinet Secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, on his work. In the Lords (11am) the day is devoted to backbench debates. First is on the value to the UK of higher education as an export; and the second on the impact on parliamentary democracy in the UK of the use of referendums. Then come two energy SI approval motions: on the Warm Home discount; and on the Oil and Gas Authority.The Commons is not sitting, but the Lords meets at 10am to debate three private members' bills First is the Conservative Lord Lexden's Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Amendment) (Sibling Couples) Bill which allows siblings aged over 30 years, to register as civil partners if they have lived together for a continuous period of 12 years immediately prior to the date of registration. Then comes the Children Act 1989 (Amendment) (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill which would take court cases on FGM into family court cases, giving them extra confidentiality. This bill comes from the Crossbencher, Lord Berkeley of Knighton.Finally there's the European Union (Information, etc.) Bill - from the Lib Dem (and ex Conservative) Lord Dykes. This would allow information and statistics about the European Union to be made available and promote town twinning arrangements. "
2018-07-17,Staying silent,https://web.archive.org//web/20180717224650/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44816048,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEven the president of the United States now sees fit to weigh in on the Brexit path Theresa May is taking.Donald Trump has said, amongst other things, that if the prime minister is successful in her plan - formalised on Thursday in a White Paper - then that would make a future trade deal with the US far less likely.So how come key player Brussels remains so uncannily quiet about the paper?Brussels badgered the UK for months and months and months about coming up with a detailed proposal on how it envisions the future EU-UK relationship after Brexit. Now they have it, surely they have an opinion about it?As far as official responses go, the most we got from Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, was that he and his colleagues now need time to analyse the White Paper in detail.On the one hand: fair enough. It is a very dense document.But I feel the EU is hiding behind the paper's 98 pages of Brexit tech-talk.In private, EU diplomats make no secret at all of their rejection of large chunks of the White Paper. Brussels has said since the beginning of Brexit negotiations that the UK can't pick and choose the ""best parts"" of EU membership and walk away from the rest when it leaves. Yet that's exactly how the White Paper is interpreted in EU circles.There is no way Michel Barnier will accept it as is.For Theresa May to get that ""deep and special"" access to the EU in trade terms, Brussels will certainly expect more concessions. But EU leaders are biding their time. Trying to calculate not if, but when, and how to get their criticisms across.They're very aware of the febrile political atmosphere in the UK and think if they make a quick comment or criticism of the White Paper, they'd be adding fuel to the fire.So if the EU is so keen for a soft Brexit - (of course we know, deep down, it would prefer no Brexit at all) - what concessions is Brussels prepared to make now to help shore up the prime minister's position in the political maelstrom at home?Worryingly few, is the answer if you're a fan of Theresa May or her White Paper.The EU still believes it holds pretty much all the cards in Brexit negotiations. I don't expect real whiffs of EU concessions before the last minute of the 11th hour this autumn.Can Theresa May hang on till then? And if she can, is she politically strong enough to strike a deal with Brussels and then sell it back home? Frankly, no one knows - and in the meantime, Brussels is stepping up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. Not because the EU or Downing Street wants that - they really do not - but because the time allotted under EU law for a withdrawal agreement to be agreed and signed off by both parties is fast running out. In the meantime, EU diplomats try to sound upbeat: the White Paper is a great springboard from which to re-start face-to-face Brexit negotiations, they say.Those talks begin again behind closed doors on Monday."
2018-07-17,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180717224650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-17,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180717224650/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.

In a resignation speech in the Commons, the former foreign secretary said a ""needless fog of self-doubt"" had descended over the past 18 months. While praising the PM's ""courage and resilience"", he said her Chequers plan would see the UK in ""miserable limbo"".He quit 10 days ago, saying he could not support the PM's EU blueprint.BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said Mr Johnson's friends were insisting he was not trying to emulate Sir Geoffrey Howe, whose caustic resignation speech in 1990 is widely seen as having paved the way for Margaret Thatcher's downfall weeks later.But by suggesting there was time for Mrs May to change her approach, she said he appeared to be telling MPs that it would be ""in their hands"" if she didn't. Addressing MPs, Mr Johnson said the ""bright certainties"" that followed the 2016 Brexit vote had dissipated and the UK risked ending up in ""economic vassalage"" if it agreed to follow EU regulations on trade, the environment and social affairs.He said the vision set out by Mrs May in her Lancaster House speech in January 2017 for a ""strong independent, self-governing Britain"" had never been turned into a firm negotiating position.By Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC's political editorIt's the first Boris Johnson speech that I can remember watching that didn't have any jokes. For his allies, that was the point. It wasn't designed, they say, to make a personal attack on Theresa May.But my goodness, it made a pretty savage attack on her policies - a ""fog of self-doubt"", ""pretending to the electorate"", ""a fantastical Heath Robinson"" proposal on customs, ""miserable permanent limbo"".For someone who less than a fortnight ago celebrated collective cabinet responsibility at Chequers, that's quite some feat.The government, he claimed, had simply not tried to make the case for a loose arrangement with the EU based on a wide-ranging free trade deal. Instead, he said the UK had conceded ground over the divorce bill, the role of the European Court of Justice and the Northern Ireland border, which he said had needlessly become ""politically charged"" and resulted in a ""fantastical, Heath Robinson"" customs arrangement being put forward. Ministers, he warned, were ""saying one thing to the EU about what we are really doing, and pretending another to the electorate"" - a situation which voters would see through.

We have time in these negotiations. We have changed tack once and we can change again.""We need to take one decision now before all others - and that is to believe in this country and what it can do because the UK's admirers across the world are fully expecting us to take back control.""Mr Johnson's speech was retweeted by a host of prominent Brexiteer Tories, among them Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the influential European Research Group of MPs.The speech of a statesman. https://t.co/2H98U9hJJJEnd of Twitter post  by @Jacob_Rees_MoggAt the same time as Mr Johnson was attacking her Brexit strategy, Mrs May was defending it before the Liaison Committee of MPs.She conceded that her proposed post-Brexit trade and tariff arrangements were a ""novel idea"" that did not exist anywhere else in the world, adding that that did not matter, if they were the ""best"" arrangements for the UK.Earlier she had said at PMQs that the final Brexit deal must honour the 2016 referendum result but also be ""workable"" in terms of protecting jobs and livelihoods.On Wednesday evening Mrs May addressed the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, where one - Simon Clarke - announced he had withdrawn a letter calling for a vote of no confidence in the PM.Mr Clarke said he remained ""deeply opposed"" to the Chequers agreement but that Mrs May deserved a chance to negotiate and ""see what comes back"".Tempers have been running high in the Commons over planning for the UK's March 2019 exit.In the past 48 hours, the government has narrowly won a series of votes on trade and customs arrangements despite substantial rebellions by pro-European Tories.Would-be rebels were reportedly warned on Tuesday that opposing the government in a vote on a customs union would lead to a vote of confidence and potentially a general election.The government ultimately won the vote by a margin of six."

Here's what happened.A testy encounter in the final PMQs before summer recess, with Jeremy Corbyn attacking the PM's Brexit troubles and Mrs May accusing him of reading from a script he had written on Tuesday and not listening to her answers.The Labour leader began by accusing cabinet ministers Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Chris Grayling of being ""referred to the police by the Electoral Commission, having refused to cooperate with the Electoral Commission"". The three were leading figures in the Vote Leave campaign, which was found on Tuesday to have broken electoral law during the 2016 EU referendum.Corbyn asks if the PM will guarantee that cabinet ministers ""cooperate fully"" with the police investigation into Vote Leave #PMQs https://t.co/SQBXZndwzg pic.twitter.com/Kj231UGgArEnd of Twitter post  by @BBCPoliticsHe asked Mrs May if the ministers would fully cooperate with the police.

She said he was wrong about that.Mr Corbyn claimed the government's Facilitated Customs Arrangement - a ""cobbled together mish mash"" - was dead in the water.  The Labour leader was wrong again, said Mrs May, and the plan was being discussed with the EU.

He also said the Conservatives had ""sunk into a mire"" of infighting.The PM said the government had been elected on a manifesto committing to the  European Convention on Human Rights. She ran through a list of things she had been doing in the past week - while she was ""agreeing on the future of Nato with president Trump"" - cue guffaws from the Labour benches - Mr Corbyn had been ""on a protest march"" against the US president.This ended with a jibe at the row over Labour's new code of conduct on anti-Semitism and the last day of term pay-off line: ""He protests, I deliver.""The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford went on Brexit. He claimed Mrs May had ""put her narrow party interest before that of the country"" as he argued the week's events had made a no-deal scenario much more likely.Mrs May defended the Government's approach to Brexit and criticised the SNP's support for Scottish independence.Mr Blackford argued the UK could not ""crash out"" of the EU without a deal and called on Mrs May to extend Article 50.""Did the prime minister come into Parliament to have this as her legacy, will she now face up to the reality and extend Article 50?""Mrs May replied: ""No.""John Woodcock who has just quit the Labour Party to sit as an independent in protest at its handling of a complaint against him, claiming the party has been taken over by the far left, asked about rail problems.Will the PM get a ""personal grip"" on the Northern rail ""fiasco"" after 170 services were cancelled due to the #WorldCup? asks @JWoodcockMP #PMQs https://t.co/w2ZMMUWEXi pic.twitter.com/mJ870EfPymEnd of Twitter post 4 by @BBCPoliticsPro-EU Tory Anna Soubry asked the PM to back her ""Cliff's law"" bill, which would prevent the media naming crime suspects, in the wake of Sir Cliff Richard's court victory over the BBC.Following Cliff Richard's legal battle with the BBC, MP @Anna_Soubry calls for a ""Cliff’s law"" to stop media naming suspects unless they are charged #PMQs https://t.co/yAa1R5SE6a pic.twitter.com/7Ncqh6yCpBEnd of Twitter post 5 by @BBCPoliticsLabour's former deputy leader, and the Mother of the House, Harriet Harman, who MPs were told had just become a grandmother, called for ""proxy voting"" in the Commons, after a row over ""pairing"" in last night's Brexit vote.""We are elected as MPs to vote in this House, and MPs having babies should not lose that right.” @HarrietHarman calls for an end to pairing in Parliament #PMQs https://t.co/w2ZMMUWEXi pic.twitter.com/2DXOvCOpM6End of Twitter post 6 by @BBCPoliticsHere is what the BBC's Andrew Neil and Laura Kuenssberg said:“In recent weeks, Mr Corbyn has often got the better of Mrs May and shown more confidence.

This was an England-Panama situation and after brutal week the PM has endured, he rather needed a 6-0 result which would have sent the Tories slouching out of the Chamber muttering pensively about their leader; they didn't. In fact the PM seemed more relaxed than usual, and while her answers remained carefully formulaic, she allowed herself to counter-attack a bit - although her pre-canned jokes seemed a bit flat. Both Jeremy Corbyn and the SNP's Ian Blackford got their own attack lines in, but they didn't seriously discomfit her.  Perhaps the most effective attack came from the Conservative backbench Brexiteer, Andrea Jenkyns, who threw the PM's Brexit Mean Brexit line back at her with the question ""at what point was it decided that Brexit means Remain."" At what point it was decided that #Brexit means Remain?"" asks @andreajenkyns 😲 #PMQs https://t.co/w2ZMMUWEXi pic.twitter.com/oVAoN5VNSeEnd of Twitter post 7 by @BBCPoliticsThat hurt, and provoked a rather snarling response from the PM, and the follow-ups from former Brexit Secretary David Davis and his erstwhile deputy Steve Baker made it clear that the backbench Brexiteer faction is not letting up. The Government needs to beware of those two: ""DD"" proved a formidable and forensic backbench operator, forcing a couple of Labour ministers to resign, in his days in Opposition; Steve Baker was the key organiser of the backbench Brexit faction in the coalition years, acting as the key strategist and unofficial whip in the manoeuvres which cornered David Cameron into conceding a referendum on the EU in the first place.As it turned out the real star of the show was the senior backbencher Keith Simpson, whose mocking swipe at Boris Johnson, wrapped in a disobliging comparison to Donald Trump, may provide a foretaste of what is to come, when the former foreign secretary makes his resignation statement later in the afternoon. Normal constraints of courtesy between colleagues and party solidarity have been cast aside by all the factions - and this looked very like an early pre-emptive strike. Resignation statements are normally heard in silence, but can be accompanied by a dumb-show. Word reaches me that once Mr Johnson had reserved his chosen spot in the Chamber with a ""prayer card"" - as is the convention - government loyalists immediately tried to secure nearby seats, so that they could be seen in TV shot around him, shaking their heads and looking disapproving. It clearly wasn't a wholly successful effort because he spent PMQs surrounded by a praetorian guard of Brexit stalwarts, but the game is clearly afoot.

It is unacceptable in our party and in wider society.""But it does not include all of the ""working examples"" given in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism.Following criticism, Labour said it would ""reopen development of the code"" in consultation with Jewish groups.Dame Margaret, the MP for Barking, clashed with Mr Corbyn in the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday.Mr Corbyn's spokesman declined to reveal the precise nature of the action being taken against her but said it would be taken under Parliamentary Labour Party procedures requiring MPs to behave in a ""respectful"" way towards colleagues and not to ""bring the party into disrepute"".Without confirming the language she had used, Dame Margaret wrote in The Guardian that she ""confronted Jeremy Corbyn in Parliament and told him to his face what I and many others are feeling"".Labour was ""so distrusted by the Jewish community, we are the last people on earth, at this time, who should think about amending a widely accepted definition of anti-Semitism"", she said.The Israel-Palestine conflict, she said, had been ""allowed to infect the party's approach to growing anti-Semitism"" saying she and other Jewish MPs had received growing amounts of anti-Semitic abuse.In adopting its new code, the party ""chose to make the party a hostile environment for Jews"", she said, adding: ""I stand by my action as well as my words.""The decision to take action against Dame Margaret has been criticised, with Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educations Trust, describing it as ""extraordinary and just appalling"".Former Foreign Secretary David Miliband tweeted: ""It is the Labour leadership which has brought the party into disrepute - not Margaret Hodge. How dare they preach about 'respect between colleagues' when this very code legitimises the most appalling disrespect.""Labour's code of conduct was drawn up after the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry that followed allegations of anti-Semitism within party ranks.The code does reproduce the IHRA's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and lists behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples from that definition:Labour's code says it is ""wrong"" to accuse Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than their own country. And it says that using Nazi comparisons in Israel-Palestine debates ""carries a strong risk of being regarded as prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party"", triggering a disciplinary investigation. A party spokeswoman said: ""The code of conduct adopts the IHRA definition and expands on and contextualises the IHRA examples to produce robust, legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases.""Mr Corbyn has said he is ""committed to eliminating anti-Semitism wherever it exists"".""Prejudice and hatred of Jewish people has no place whatsoever in the Labour Party,"" he said earlier this year."
2018-07-18,Brexit deal must be 'workable' - May,https://web.archive.org//web/20180718184230/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44867977,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has insisted any Brexit deal must be ""workable"" as she came under fire from both Labour and Conservative MPs in the Commons.During Prime Minister's Questions, she said she disagreed with Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, who asked her ""at what point it was decided Brexit means Remain"".The PM said any deal had to be credible and protect the economy, as well as honouring the 2016 referendum result.Jeremy Corbyn said the Conservatives had ""sunk into a mire"" of infighting.And former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has increased the pressure on the prime minister, accusing her government of ""dithering"" over what it wants and telling MPs it is ""not too late to save Brexit"". Appearing before the Liaison Committee of select committee chairs, Mrs May said she stood by her claim that ""no deal was better a bad deal"" when it came to Brexit.  She said the government was working for a ""good deal"" but would be stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" scenario, with plans to issue ""technical notices"" to businesses that would be affected.But she would not set out the ""consequences"" of leaving the EU without a deal to the public until it happened, she told liaison committee chairwoman Sarah Wollaston.Mrs May also conceded that her proposed post-Brexit trade and tariff arrangements were a ""novel idea"" that did not exist anywhere else in the world, adding that that did not matter, if they were the ""best"" arrangements for the UK.And she admitted that the ""facilitated customs arrangement"" plan set out in her Brexit White Paper may not be fully ready by the time the transition period expires at the end of 2020.And under questioning from veteran Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash, she denied showing copies of the White Paper to Angela Merkel or other European leaders before it was published and given to MPs.During the final session of PMQs before the summer recess, Mrs May defended her handling of Brexit negotiations and her recent talks with Donald Trump, telling Mr Corbyn that while the Labour leader ""protests, I deliver"".Acknowledging ""strong feelings"" on all sides, she insisted her blueprint for future relations with the EU was realistic and already being considered by the EU.In response to Ms Jenkyns's question, she insisted ""Brexit continues to mean Brexit"" and the government should be ""talking about the positives"" of leaving. But the PM added: ""I know she has criticised me for looking for a solution that is workable. I disagree with her on that because I think we need a solution which is going to work for the UK.""On Tuesday, ministers saw off a bid by Tory rebels to create a customs union with the EU if a trade deal failed. The rebel amendment to the trade bill was defeated by only six votes.Twelve Conservatives rebelled against their party by supporting the amendment but the government's total was boosted by the support of four Labour MPs.Conservative MPs were warned that voting for the amendment, and therefore against the government, could lead to a vote of no confidence in the prime minister or a general election, leading Tory remainer Anna Soubry said. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was an ""appalling spectacle"" - and that she would be the first in the queue to give her backing to Mrs May. ""The problem is, I don't think that she's in charge any more,"" said the MP for Broxtowe. ""I've no doubt that Jacob Rees Mogg is running our country."" The former minister called for a government of national unity to deal with Brexit. ""I personally would abandon the Labour frontbench and I would reach beyond it and I would encompass Plaid Cymru, the SNP and other sensible, pragmatic people who believe in putting this country's interests first and foremost,"" she said. She also said that many MPs were ""frightened of the extremes"" within their local associations. Hardline Brexiteers led by Mr Rees Mogg are ruthless and organised, while the ""pragmatic majority"" are loyal to the prime minister, she added. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, who is effectively Mrs May's second-in-command, rejected claims her government was in desperate straits over Brexit.""When the government doesn't have an overall majority in either house of Parliament, things are sometimes close on votes,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.But he said the prime minister was ""absolutely focused on getting the right deal for the country in negotiations with her European counterparts"".He apologised to Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson, who has accused the Conservatives of double crossing her in Tuesday night's vote. Ms Swinson, who is on a maternity leave, had a ""pairing"" arrangement with Tory chairman Brandon Lewis, which meant he should not have taken part in the vote. Mr Lidington said the fact that Mr Lewis had voted was a ""genuine mess-up"" that should not have happened and he had apologised to Ms Swinson.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning"
2018-07-18,MP faces suspension over paid holidays,https://web.archive.org//web/20180718184230/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44869627,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe DUP's Ian Paisley is in danger of being forced to stand down as an MP and face a by-election after being found to have breached parliamentary rules. The MP faces a 30-day suspension after he failed to declare the details of two family holidays in 2013 paid for by the Sri Lankan government.The claims first appeared in the Daily Telegraph in September 2017.Mr Paisley said he accepted the decision but took issue with the Daily Telegraph's ""sensationalised report"".He said he would further address the issue in the House of Commons on Thursday.In a statement, Mr Paisley's solicitor said his client had ""apologised unreservedly at the outset for his unintentional failure to register the hospitality he received"". The DUP said it noted the House of Commons Standards Committee's report on Mr Paisley and added that ""these matters will now be considered by the party officers"".The sanction could trigger a process at Westminster which could lead to a by-election in North Antrim.  The recommendation to suspend Mr Paisley will now go before the House of Commons for approval, in the form of a motion.The motion is usually moved by the Leader of the House. Sinn Féin Foyle MP Elisha McCallion said the DUP must demand the resignation of Mr Paisley, and that it was ""an issue of integrity in government and in public office"".Ulster Unionist leader and North Antrim assembly member, Robin Swann, said the findings were ""embarrassing for North Antrim"" and he ""was sure many people there would agree with me that this is not what they expect of their MP"".TUV leader and North Antrim assembly member, Jim Allister, said Mr Paisley should consider his position.""If any key vote on Brexit is lost because of Ian Paisley's antics, then, that will be his shameful legacy for all time,"" he said.SDLP assembly member for South Down, Colin McGrath, said Mr Paisley's position was ""untenable"" and that his party would be seeking a Recall Petition. ""Should this trigger a by-election in North Antrim, Mr Paisley should not challenge the seat again,"" he added.Alliance assembly member for south Belfast, Paula Bradshaw,  said Mr Paisley had ""let both himself and his constituents down"" and called on him to consider his position.Ian Paisley has been the MP for North Antrim since May 2010, and is the youngest child of the former DUP leader of the same name.Mr Paisley's father, who previously represented the constituency, founded the DUP in 1971 in opposition to what he saw as the increasingly liberal approach of the Ulster Unionists; the party of the political establishment since Northern Ireland was founded in 1921.In September 2013, it was reported that Mr Paisley had claimed the most expenses of any MP in the year to April.His combined staffing, travel and accommodation costs were £232,000.At the time, Mr Paisley said the business expenses ""are unavoidable costs that an MP incurs whilst running a busy constituency office and commuting to Parliament"" and ""none of this money goes to the MP"".Mr Paisley referred himself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards when the allegations first emerged. At the time, Mr Paisley, a Democratic Unionist, dismissed them as being ""devoid of fact or logic"". The paper claimed Mr Paisley and his family enjoyed two holidays in Sri Lanka in 2013 paid for by the government. The Standards Commissioner investigation focused on whether or not the MP breached the rules in respect of the members register of financial interest. The 30-day ban, if accepted, could trigger a Recall Petition by which an MP can lose their seat if 10% of the eligible electorate in their constituency signs a petition. But the MP would be free to stand again in the subsequent by-election and it is understood Mr Paisley has indicated he would do so. Under the Recall of MPs Act, which came into effect in 2016, MPs who are convicted of a criminal offence and jailed, barred from the House of Commons for 10 sitting days or convicted of providing false information on allowance claims can lose their seat if there is a successful petition to recall them.  Where an MP is found to have broken the Code of Conduct or committed a contempt, the Committee on Standards may recommend a period of suspension, which leads to a motion in the House.According to the House of Commons Library, only two MPs since 1949, Teresa Gorman and Keith Vaz, have been suspended for a month following reports from the Standards and Privileges Committee.Ms Gorman's suspension was in relation to the non-disclosure of property interests. Mr Vaz's suspension was in relation to ""serious breaches of the Code of Conduct and a contempt of the House"".Most suspensions after committee reports are much shorter.Ian Paisley's father was suspended for five sitting days for disorderly conduct in February and November 1981 and again in November 1993. In her report to the Standards Committee the Standards commissioner found that Mr Paisley breached the House Rules on the following After considering the report and ""the seriousness of this matter"" the Standards Committee recommended ""that Mr Paisley be suspended from the service of the House for a period of 30 sitting days starting on 4 September 2018"".They also required that Mr Paisley register the benefits he received from the Sri Lankan government which will be italicised in the register to indicate that they are a late entry."
2018-07-18,Brexit: New move to keep EU citizenship,https://web.archive.org//web/20180718184230/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44871876,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA petition is under way to make EU citizenship permanent, despite the probability that UK nationals will lose it after Brexit.The European Commission will register the initiative on Monday. Petitioners will need to get a total of at least one million signatures that includes residents in at least seven EU nations.It is a European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) - a method for changing EU law.EU citizenship guarantees freedom of movement in the EU and other rights.The UK organiser of the petition, Anthony Simpson, told the BBC that ""the point is to raise the issue - a lot of UK nationals don't understand they are also EU citizens"".A member of the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation, he said there was a need for legal clarity on EU citizenship and ""the European Court of Justice (ECJ) remains pivotal in all this"".EU citizenship is described in Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and includes the rights to:The EU treaties say EU citizenship ""does not replace national citizenship"" but ""is additional to it"". So EU citizenship cannot be acquired by giving up UK citizenship.Mr Simpson said his ECI petition was free, but a £2,500 private donation had been used to promote the campaign on social media and ""we have developed a lot more contacts"" in the EU.His earlier ECI, called ""Retaining European Citizenship"", got only 24,000 signatures.The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - two years after Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the exit process by invoking Article 50. The UK has also negotiated a transition period lasting until the end of 2020, during which freedom of movement will remain effective. Those deadlines could well scupper the attempt to keep EU citizenship for UK nationals. Read more on this topic:Once registered by the Commission, an ECI has one year in which to collect at least a million signatures of support. Even if that happens, the Commission is only required to consider the petition or reject it - there is no obligation to make it law.The UK government and some experts on European law argue that Brexit will automatically strip UK nationals of their EU citizenship. But the UK's future legal ties with the EU still have to be worked out. In a parliamentary answer on the citizenship question, Lord Ahmad of the Foreign Office said ""when the UK ceases to be a member of the European Union, British nationals will no longer hold EU citizenship, unless they hold dual nationality with another EU member state"".Lord Callanan of the Brexit department DExEU said retaining EU citizenship for Britons post-Brexit had not been ruled out, but it ""would involve changing treaties"". ""The other side [EU negotiators] has shown no interest whatever in doing it,"" he added.Legal opinions on the EU citizenship question are quoted by the House of Commons Library.Brexit makes it unlikely that in future UK nationals will be able to appeal to the ECJ if they feel their rights have been violated. One of Brexit's key aims is to restore full jurisdiction to UK courts.An important aspect of EU citizenship is that it provides reciprocal healthcare arrangements - including the EHIC card for medical emergencies abroad. There is also a complex web of reciprocal social welfare arrangements in the EU.The UK and EU have reached a deal to protect the rights of the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK and estimated 1.2 million UK citizens living in other EU countries. But many details still have to be negotiated, and they will take effect only if an overall Brexit deal is signed off."

The row blew up after voting had taken place on the Trade Bill, where the main battleground was an amendment to do with staying in the customs union if the UK fails to agree a trade deal with the EU.The Lib Dems voted against the government alongside Labour, the SNP and some pro-EU Tories, but the government won by 307 to 301.Pairing is an informal arrangement between two MPs of opposing parties that allows them, with the agreement of the Whips (Whips are the MPs responsible for discipline in each party), to miss occasional votes in the House.If two members from opposite sides of the House both agree to miss a vote, then by agreeing to differ they would cancel out each other's vote, so neither member need turn up.Ms Swinson, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats and MP for East Dunbartonshire, gave birth to her second son Gabriel on 29 June.She said she had been told Mr Lewis would be her ""pair"" for the votes on the Trade Bill.Mr Lewis did not take part in most of the day's Trade Bill votes, but did take part in the two closest divisions - the one on customs and another on medicine regulation, which the government lost.Just how low will your govt stoop @theresa_may? When @andrealeadsom delayed proxy voting motions, she *assured* those of us who were pregnant that we would be paired when necessary.

I think it was an honest mistake made by the whips in fast-moving circumstances. I know how important the pair is to everyone, especially new parents, and I apologise.""In his apology, Conservative chief whip Julian Smith said Mr Lewis had been ""asked to vote in error"".Labour's Harriet Harman said the episode highlighted the need to allow MPs on parenting leave to nominate a proxy on their behalf.The Commons backed this principle earlier this year and a committee of MPs has put forward recommendations for how it might work.Ms Swinson said Parliament should now make a binding decision on introducing proxy voting before it breaks up for its summer recess on Tuesday.In an urgent question in the House of Commons, Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael said there had been a ""very serious breach of the convention"" and that while he accepted the apology, it was ""less than clear"" to him how it had happened.He described pairing as a ""19th century practice"" trying to cover for ""21st century employment law"" on baby leave.Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said the incident involving Ms Swinson's vote had happened ""entirely in error"" and ""will not be repeated"".MPs will consider the issue of proxy voting ""at the earliest opportunity"", she added.Speaker John Bercow warned of ""endless procrastination"" over the issue, and said a decision must be made soon.Labour's shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz said Parliament should agree immediately to ""nod through"" MPs on baby leave.""It's vital we are a modern workplace and that those on baby leave can have their vote recorded."""

Announcing his resignation from the party, he accused Labour of failing to appoint an independent investigator to rule on the disciplinary case.He suggested the process was being ""manipulated for factional purposes"" and he had seen e-mails showing senior party figures wanted to stop him standing as a candidate again because of his views on the leadership.In a wide-ranging attack on Mr Corbyn, he said Labour was not a ""credible"" alternative government and its leader would pose a ""clear risk"" to the UK's security if he became prime minister.""I have promised to fight for local jobs, protect the shipyard and ensure the safety of the my constituents through strong defence and national security.""I now believe more strongly than ever you have made Labour unfit to deliver those objectives."" Mr Woodcock, who asked a question about Northern Rail during Wednesday's session of Prime Minister's Questions, said he was committed to continuing to represent his constituents in Parliament and was prepared to ""work with the government when it is trying to do the right thing"". He added: ""The party for which I have campaigned since I was a boy is no longer the broad church it has always historically been. ""Anti-Semitism is being tolerated and Labour has been taken over at nearly every level by the hard left, far beyond the dominance they achieved at the 1980s militancy.""Labour has rejected claims its disputes resolution process has become politicised, pointing out that the MP's resignation means the investigation into alleged harassment cannot be concluded and the complainant will be denied their right to have their claim heard. Asked whether there should now be a by-election, a party spokesman said ""basic rules of democratic accountability"" dictated that when MPs ""abandoned"" the platform they were elected on, the public should have their say. And Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, who has called on critics of Mr Corbyn to shut up or get out, said the MP's resignation from the party was ""no big deal"". ""He resigned from Labour's values a long time ago.""His resignation comes a day after Labour's ruling National Executive approved a new code of conduct on anti-Semitism, which has been criticised by Jewish leaders and some of its own MPs.The document, drawn up after protests by Jewish groups against Labour's handling of the issue, states anti-Semitism is racism but does not fully repeat the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition.Labour said the code, drawn up following the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry into anti-Semitism, addressed concerns about alleged anti-Semitic remarks by activists and better reflected the views of Jewish community groups.

2018-07-18,What was the goal?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180718184230/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44871637,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt's the first Boris Johnson speech that I can remember watching that didn't have any jokes. For his allies, that was the point. It wasn't designed, they say, to make a personal attack on Theresa May. But my goodness, it made a pretty savage attack on her policies - a ""fog of self-doubt"", ""pretending to the electorate"", ""a fantastical Heath Robinson"" proposal on customs, ""miserable permanent limbo"".For someone who less than a fortnight ago celebrated collective cabinet responsibility at Chequers, that's quite some feat.But it makes me wonder exactly what was being said on the Chequers terrace when we captured Mr Johnson and Mrs May in what looked like vigorous conversation 10 days ago. What the speech today was designed to do, his supporters hope, was to present the former foreign secretary without the wisecracks, as a serious politician who is determined to argue for what he believes. His now small band of supporters circled him on the green benches as he spoke. He made the case for the Prime Minister's first big Brexit plan, her speech at Lancaster House back in January 2017 when she first outlined some of her aims and explicitly, completely and totally ruled out staying in the single market. For some Brexiteers Mr Johnson's words will be hugely welcome, a call to stop the rot as they would see it. One former minister told me plainly ""he was right - Lancaster House is a distant memory"", even comparing Mr Johnson's words to the closing scene of Gladiator when Russell Crowe playing the former all powerful Roman General Maximus, bloodied and staggering, said, ""there was a dream that was Rome that shall be realized"".The message, one man's dream can inspire a great many others to glory. Forget for a moment it didn't exactly end well for that particular Roman. But the question this afternoon is whether the speech can start the process of restoring Boris Johnson to his former political glory and more importantly of course, will it make a blind bit of difference to Brexit. On the first point, as Mr Johnson sat down along with some cheers, I heard another MP though call, ""is that it?"" His many critics will point to what was not in the speech, a new plan for Brexit. A government minister told me it was more of his ""deluded fantasy"" saying his ""simplistic notions"" about what could be achieved when we leave the EU won't compensate for what we could lose. Another MP told me ""it didn't really go anywhere, it had no substance"". The other crucial difference in pushing for the Lancaster House model is that it ignores the not inconsiderable fact that that speech and that set of proposals was developed before the general election, before Theresa May shot herself in the foot. Mr Johnson however will, after today's speech, be a well-known, prominent voice who has made it plain he will fight against the prime minister's current stance and any attempts to compromise further. With the turmoil in the Tory party, having him on the loose could, in time, make a difference. Not least, he is one of the few politicians in the country who is known, for good or for ill, by his first name. That is as much of a risk as an asset but it's real, and those who supported Brexit may well listen.For him, today was not about intentionally blasting into a leadership race, but trying to rebuild a new, for the want of a better word, brand of Boris Johnson. The clownish caricature that saw him through much of his time as Mayor of London and the referendum didn't wash as foreign secretary. After that, the number of MPs he excites as a potential leader is tiny these days. But today's speech was not an immediate call but a pitch to get him back in the long term game. It seems unlikely right now after the last couple of years. But one of his detractors grudgingly admitted ""he's never quite the busted flush"". "

But do they make a difference to getting on in politics?""I think that in this chamber a Brummie accent is a very rare thing. And I look forward to changing that!""So said Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, when she gave her maiden speech in the House of Commons in 2015.Accents are rich in sound but, as Ms Phillips emphasised, they are heavy in baggage that we load on to others and others load on to us.But do we all have an accent, wherever we come from?""We do. It is linguistically impossible to not have an accent,"" Rob Drummond, a linguist at Manchester Metropolitan University, says.""But the very fact that some people think they don't have an accent tells us something interesting about society. Because the people who think they don't, tend to be the people who have an accent from around the south-east of England.""This is still perceived as some kind of a standard way of speaking, but of course the only way it is perceived to be standard is because it is where the seat of power - between London and Oxford and Cambridge - traditionally has been.""There are MPs who have had problems being understood in the Commons. Alan Brown, the SNP MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun in Ayrshire is one. So too is Emma Lewell-Buck, who has been the Labour MP for South Shields on Tyneside since 2013.""Hansard would often ask for clarification. I type my speeches out in full now, to make Hansard's job easier, for clarity,"" Ms Lewell-Buck says, referring to the team that transcribes every word spoken in Parliament.""I think there are a hell of a lot more accents and regional voices in there, even in the time I've been in there,"" she adds. ""It makes it more a vibrant Parliament. It makes it sound like the country it represents a bit more.""But both Mr Brown and Ms Lewell-Buck have encountered the same thing back in their constituencies: surprise from locals that their MP sounds like they do. A welcome surprise, but a surprise nonetheless.It is a ""snobbery element in reverse"", reflects Mr Brown.I am fascinated by accents.Not just because I am intensely proud of my roots in the Yorkshire Dales, but because as a reporter, voice is more than just our vocal fingerprint. On the radio it is the whole professional ""us"".And believe me, you become very aware, very early on in a career in my game, that phonetic diversity matters. It is a badge of difference, for better or worse.I will never forget the observation from my year as a trainee in 2001 when I found out a kindly soul had predicted of my future: ""He won't get on the air with a voice like that."" As it happens, I rather suspect I have been incredibly fortunate in my timing - my career starting at just the point it was seen to be fashionable to have more regional accents in broadcasting. I also suspect there is probably a greater prejudice in our industry now against voices perceived to be posh.But is this hang-up about accents uniquely British? No, it turns out. Philippe Blanchet, a professor of linguistics at the University of Rennes, says French presidents ""speak with a neutral, standardised pronunciation, which is based on the one that comes from the higher classes in Paris"".""They are not supposed to have an accent. Because in France when people say you have an accent, it means that you don't use the standardised pronunciation,"" he says, adding: ""The least accepted accents in France are those of the northern part of the country and those from working-class urban and rural parts of the country.""A rather familiar observation...So, could a UK prime minister ever have a Brummie accent?I do not say this with a huge amount of conviction, but I think the answer is, probably, possibly, yes. If they were seen by their party and the country to be a worthy leader on every other metric of these things, maybe they could turn their accent to their advantage, claim it to be the very essence of modernity and a new politics.And yet, there is still evidence that prejudice could stand in their way. A poll by YouGov in 2014 put the Brummie accent at the bottom of a league table for ""the most attractive accents in the British Isles"".It is one of the reasons why I wrote ""probably, possibly"" a few sentences ago."

The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade.UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States.Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world.But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops.  The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019.To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. Leading EU figures have hinted that Brexit could be halted. It would need all the other EU member states to agree.A less formal version of this option would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue.The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - including Justine Greening.With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.Please upgrade your browser"

But how often do the UK's MPs meet compared with politicians in other countries?They have a long summer holiday - spending six weeks away from Westminster, dealing with constituents' concerns and, just maybe, getting away from it all. So, how often are MPs expected, or at least able, to attend debates and votes?During the last complete parliamentary session, 2016-17, the House of Commons sat on 142 days. During the previous session - 2015-16 - the number was 158.Commons sessions vary in length, sometimes shortened by elections or elongated by the lack of a State Opening of Parliament (during which the Queen's Speech sets out the government's legislative programme). But the 2015-16 and 2016-17 sessions each lasted just under a year, making them roughly comparable with more regularly sitting chambers elsewhere in the world.Different legislative bodies compile and present their schedules in different ways, and they have different lengths of working days. But we can at least say the UK's number of sitting days is among the biggest we've come across.The calendar for the US House of Representatives shows its members are scheduled to sit for 124 days this calendar year. In 2017, it was 145 days.Japan's House of Representatives usually meets on 150 days a year.In Canada this year, the House of Commons is scheduled to sit on 127 days.Meanwhile, in Germany's Bundestag, it's compulsory for members to attend on sitting days. This year, there are 104 of those.Of course, the work of a politician can't be measured entirely in terms of how often they attend a debating chamber.""It's a common misconception that MPs only work on those days when Parliament is sitting,"" says Alice Lilly, leading parliamentary monitor at the Institute for Government. ""When the Commons is in recess MPs still do a variety of other work, such as attending events, making visits, or conducting surgeries in their constituencies.""And MPs who are ministers will still have ministerial responsibilities to deal with during recess, in addition to their constituency work.""While in the UK there's debate over whether MPs spend enough time in Parliament, in India Westminster's politicians are sometimes held up as an example of hard workers. Earlier this year, the Communist Party of India cited them as it sought to bring in a law ensuring Parliament sits for at least 100 days.Another member of the sub-100 club is New Zealand. Its House of Representatives is scheduled to meet for 93 days this year.That's more than the 65 days on which Australia's own House of Representatives is to meet.But this is not the smallest number of attendance days we found.The almost-3,000-member National People's Congress of China - regarded by Western observers as little more than a ""rubber stamp"" for Communist Party decisions - gets together only once a year. And its most recent session, in March, lasted just over two weeks.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

Writing in the Times, Justine Greening, who used to be education secretary, argued that another vote would be ""the only way to end deadlock"".But how, in practice, could a second vote happen?The government has ruled out a new Brexit referendum and the Labour party says it's unlikely - although its Shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, says it is sensible to keep ""all our options on the table"" - in the event of Parliament voting down a Brexit deal or in the case of a ""no deal"" scenario.Downing Street said, in response to Ms Greening, that a referendum will not happen ""in any circumstances"".So unless there is a dramatic change in party policy, it's highly unlikely a referendum would be called in the first place.That's because a referendum requires an Act of Parliament, which needs to be voted through by the majority of MPs.And while there are vocal supporters on all sides, currently there are not enough MPs who support the idea of a second referendum.Even if MPs and peers agreed in principle to hold a second referendum, the legislative process can be drawn out.Parliament would need to pass detailed rules for the conduct of the poll and the regulation of campaigners.It took  seven months before Parliament signed off the previous referendum legislation in 2015. Further time was also needed to pass secondary legislation on areas such as voting registration.In theory, Parliament could copy over some of the legislation from the 2015 Act in order to try to speed the process up. But according to David Jeffery, a politics lecturer at Liverpool University, this might not save a lot of time because issues would still need to be debated and scrutinised by MPs and Lords.Aside from the time to pass the legislation, there's also the length of the campaign to consider.Last time around there was a four-month period between the then Prime Minister David Cameron announcing the referendum in February 2016, and the vote taking place on 23 June.Furthermore, the Electoral Commission has recommended that in future there should be at least a six-month gap between legislation being passed and a referendum being held.That's to allow enough time to register campaigns, put counting officers in place and give people information on how to vote.So combining the time to pass the legislation and allowing for a campaign, it might not be possible to hold a second referendum before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU in March 2019 (i.e. when the Article 50 process is due to expire).And holding a referendum after the Article 50 process could cause a number of practical problems.For one, what if the country voted to remain in the EU, but had already left by the time the vote was held?This could be avoided if the EU agreed to extend the Article 50 deadline - but this would need to be unanimously agreed by all EU member states.There's also the referendum question itself and the options on the ballot paper to consider.These need to be presented ""clearly, simply and neutrally"", according to the Electoral Commission. Justine Greening argues for three options: accept a negotiated Brexit deal, stay in the EU, or leave with no deal.David Jeffery says having more than a yes/no option could complicate the process:""With three options you could have a situation where just 34% decide the winning option. ""And that leads to questions about the type of voting system you want - like choosing the options by preference order,"" he says.""But then you need to ask 'do the public understand the system and how might it work in such a short period of time?'""In the end it would be up to the Electoral Commission to assess that question.

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-18,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180718184230/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign.

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

There's no justification for us to create additional burdens on business just because the UK wants to leave."" Mr Barnier questioned the UK's plans for a ""common rulebook"" for EU-UK trade as it only referred to goods checked at the border, not areas like pesticide use, adding: ""How can we protect consumers in Europe?""He also questioned whether the plans were workable without additional bureaucracy and said there were ""practical problems"" about how tariffs would be determined and collected - under the UK's plan, EU member states would collect tariffs on the UK's behalf and vice versa.But Mr Barnier suggested the EU's controversial ""backstop"" proposal aimed at avoiding a hard Irish border could be changed: ""There will be a deal if there is an agreement on the backstop. ""It's not necessarily our backstop. We can work on this, amend it, improve our backstop ... But we need an operational backstop now, in the Withdrawal Agreement, and not later.""Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg described Mr Barnier's speech as ""aggressive"" in a tweet:Today's aggressive comments by Messrs Varadkar and Barnier show why we are right to be leaving the mafia-like European Union.End of Twitter post  by @Jacob_Rees_MoggOn a visit to Belfast on Friday, Theresa May said the ""seamless border"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic was ""a foundation stone on which the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement rests"" and the concept of a hard border was now ""almost inconceivable"".But she reiterated her opposition to the EU's ""backstop"" proposal, that would see Northern Ireland effectively staying in the single market for goods and the customs union, as ""something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept"". And she dismissed suggestions made by former foreign secretary Boris Johnson that technology could be used to avoid the need for a hard border: ""No technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border.""She said the White Paper was a ""significant development"" of the UK's position and offered a ""coherent package"".""It is now for the EU to respond - not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind.""And, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions.""Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Ireland's RTE radio there had been a ""lukewarm"" response in Brussels to the UK White Paper.He added: ""We don't have any British proposal in terms of a functioning backstop in its entirety. We have bits and pieces of ideas."""
2018-07-19,EU must 'evolve' Brexit position - PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44892385,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe European Union must ""evolve"" its position on Brexit and not fall back on unworkable proposals regarding the Irish border, Theresa May has said.The prime minister made the remarks in Belfast on Friday, during a two-day visit to Northern Ireland.The issue of the Irish border has been the key sticking point in Brexit talks so far.The UK and EU have agreed that there should be no hard border in Ireland, but are at odds over how to achieve it.The backstop solution is effectively an insurance policy -  to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if appropriate customs arrangements cannot be agreed by the EU and UK in time for the end of the transition period in December 2020.The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system.However, the UK said that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea.On Friday, Mrs May again repeated her opposition to that, saying: ""The economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal 'third country' customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and believe no British prime minister could ever accept"".She also said both sides in the negotiation  ""share a determination never to see a hard border in Northern Ireland"".""And no technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet, or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border"".However, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has questioned Mrs May's plan for a future trade relationship with the EU, saying it could weaken the single market and create burdens for business.He said the UK's Brexit White Paper, published on 12 July, opened ""the way to a constructive discussion"" but must be ""workable"".Mr Barnier questioned whether plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical.Earlier this week, the government backed an amendment to its Customs Bill that would make it illegal for Northern Ireland to be outside the UK's customs territory. Mrs May said the EU's backstop proposal would be a breach of the Belfast Agreement - and that her plan, agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers earlier this month, was the best way forward.If UK Govt don’t support current EU wording on Backstop in draft Withdrawal Agreement, then obligation is on them to propose a viable and legally operable alternative wording that delivers same result: no border infrastructure. Clear UK commitments were made on this in Dec+March.End of Twitter post  by @simoncoveney""What I've said to the EU is that the legal text they've produced is not acceptable, that's why we proposed an alternative to that,"" she said.She said there now needed to be a renewed focus on EU-UK negotiations with ""increased pace and intensity"".The prime minister also met several of the political parties in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald said the visit was ""anything but reassuring"".""In fact it's now clear the British prime minister has come here to pick a fight with Ireland and to pick a fight with the EU,"" Mrs McDonald said.However, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, defended the prime minister.""What she has done is set out her agenda, that's very important. She talked about working together to find solutions, and the need to work collaboratively,"" she said.Theresa May wants a backstop that would see the whole of the UK staying in the customs union for a limited period of time after the transition period - something the EU has said is unacceptable.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme the government was committed to getting a legal text for a backstop.Earlier, the Irish Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney tweeted that if the UK did not accept the EU wording on a backstop in the draft withdrawal agreement, they would have to propose an  alternative that would deliver the same result. .@theresa_may arrived to protesters shouting “your rights, our rights” @BBCNewsNI @bbcnewsline pic.twitter.com/JJwBFGFs2LEnd of Twitter post  by @KellyBonnerReacting to his comments, Mrs Bradley said while the EU had put forward a legal text, ""we do not accept it"". ""We've put forward a counter proposal and we're now working on how we get a backstop that we are committed to delivering but it has to be a backstop that respects the integrity of the whole UK and does not put a border in the Irish sea.""The Shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd, told the BBC Labour had always been ""very clear"" that the UK should be part of the customs union. EU and UK negotiators have been meeting in Brussels this week to discuss the border issue.Friday's speech in Northern Ireland marks the prime minister's first major attempt to sell the Chequers agreement since it was reached by her cabinet earlier this month.She is due to tour other parts of the UK over the summer in an attempt to persuade businesses and citizens of its benefits.Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit.The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards.But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date of 29 March 2019 fast approaching.The Republic of Ireland will remain within the EU and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said his government is making contingency plans for ""the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit"".Mrs May also addressed the impasse at Stormont.Northern Ireland has been without a government for 18 months, after power-sharing between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin collapsed.She added that until devolution is restored, the government would fulfil its responsibilities but warned interventions from Westminster were ""no substitute"" in the long-term."
2018-07-19,PM's whip excuse blatantly untrue - Labour,https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44897844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour's deputy leader Tom Watson has accused Theresa May of making ""blatantly untrue excuses"" for the behaviour of her chief whip.Mr Watson said the PM's defence of Julian Smith was ""unbelievable"" and public trust in politics was at stake.Mr Smith is under fire after telling a Tory MP to take part in a key Brexit vote, despite an agreement not to with a Lib Dem MP on maternity leave.Pressed on Friday, the PM repeated her claim it was an ""honest mistake"".Pairing is an informal arrangement between two MPs of opposing parties that allows them, with the agreement of the whips (whips are the MPs responsible for discipline in each party), to miss occasional votes in the House - for example if they are ill, off on leave or out of the country.Mr Lewis, who was paired with the Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson, did not take part in most of Tuesday's Trade Bill votes, but did take part in the two closest divisions - one on customs, which the government won by just six votes, and another on medicine regulation, which it lost.Both he and Mr Smith have apologised to Ms Swinson, who gave birth to her second son Gabriel on 29 June and is on maternity leave, saying it was an ""honest mistake"".Asked whether she endorsed her chief whip's conduct, Mrs May said: ""There was an honest mistake made for which the chief whip and Brandon Lewis have both apologised to the member concerned.""By BBC political correspondent Chris MasonThere is an old saying in politics. When you are explaining, you are losing.The Conservatives have been doing a lot of explaining on this pairing row.Tory sources are drawing a distinction between ""long-term"" pairing arrangements, such as those covering maternity leave which are sacrosanct, and ""short-term"" arrangements which, they argue, are frequently breached by all sides.The twist is they broke the long-term pair with Jo Swinson ""by accident,"" and while they acknowledge Julian Smith did ""explore and possibly instruct"" shorter-term pairs to be broken, none actually were.Labour, to put it politely, say this is rubbish. ""This is about trust and honour,"" a source tells me. ""Julian Smith has tried to cheat, and should resign.""Some Conservatives too are pretty angry. ""Tacky,"" ""dishonest,"" ""appalling"" and ""concerning"" are among the words used by some.But a government struggling to get its business through the Commons can ill afford to lose the man whose very job it is ensure it wins those votes.But they have faced furious criticism - both from Labour and the Lib Dems, and some Tory MPs - amid suspicion Mr Smith deliberately ordered MPs to break their pairing deals because the votes were so important.Labour deputy leader Mr Watson said on Friday: ""It is unbelievable that the prime minister has repeated the desperate and blatantly untrue excuses made by her party chair and chief whip.""This is a serious issue that goes beyond efficient administration in the House of Commons. This is about public trust in politics. At such a crucial time for our country, people expect candour and decency, not cowardice and dishonesty.""He said if Mr Lewis and Mr Smith would not resign, Mrs May ""should find the strength to sack them"".""From forcing seriously ill MPs into the Commons in their wheelchairs, carrying sick buckets, to cheating a new mum out of her vote, this government is rotten to its core."" The Lib Dems have called on chief whip Mr Smith to explain himself after reports he told Mr Lewis and two other Tory MPs that they should go ahead and vote, despite being paired. Two of the MPs are reported to have refused to break their pairing arrangements.Conservative backbencher Philip Davies, who on Thursday became the third Conservative to declare publicly that he has submitted a letter of no confidence in Theresa May's leadership, told BBC Newsnight he had had his ""differences"" with the chief whip.But he said Mr Smith had ""always been completely honourable, decent, I have never questioned his integrity once"".""My understanding is that in this Parliament alone the pairings have been broken over 50 times .. and the overwhelming majority of those times, it was broken by opposition parties,"" he added.Referring to the absence of the Lib Dem leader and his predecessor from Tuesday's votes, Mr Davies said: ""I think this is a diversion tactic from the Lib Dems because Vince Cable and Tim Farron couldn't be bothered to turn up for a vote.""But other Conservative MPs, including Anna Soubry, Peter Bone and Heidi Allen, have also raised concerns. Mrs Allen said the chief whip had been ""unable to confirm to me that he did not give instructions to break pairs"" and she could ""only conclude MPs were told to break pairs on Tuesday"".""I refuse to be tarnished by this behaviour so will not stand by and say nothing. Integrity and honesty are fundamental to our democracy. Anything less is unacceptable."""

The UK is hoping the EU will back the proposals so an exit deal can be struck by the autumn, ahead of the UK's official departure from the EU in March.But the proposals, including a ""common rule book"" between the two sides, angered many Tory MPs. Mrs Leadsom, who campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 EU referendum, told The House the prime minister was ""planning to engage quite strongly"" with Brexiteers over the next few days to ""help them to understand"" why the Irish border is a serious issue.She said it was incumbent on the government to ""make the case"" for the Chequers agreement - but that the EU must know that it was a final offer.""The EU has simply not taken us seriously so far in terms of the future agreement.""What this deal does is it says to them, 'right, now we can have a free trading area where there won't be the need for border checks and controls'.""It's saying to the EU, 'you better take this seriously'. In my view, it's take this seriously or we are heading for no deal. The message to the EU has to be, 'this is the final offer'.""Please upgrade your browserShe said the EU were not going to ""wriggle away at it and we're going to accept it. It is a very hard and fast offer to the EU that makes sense for them.""But if they don't accept it, we're also ramping up our no deal preparations. That's where we will be heading and they will have forced us to do that.""My message to the EU is, 'take this seriously because otherwise, you're forcing us down the road of no deal'.""Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit.The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards.But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date fast approaching."

""Their use is governed by a strict legal framework.""Throughout any deployment and beyond, the welfare of the young person is the paramount consideration."""
2018-07-19,UK government borrowing at 11-year low,https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44898624,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowGovernment borrowing in the April-to-June period fell to its lowest level since 2007, official figures show.Borrowing for the financial year so far has reached £16.8bn, £5.4bn less than in the same period in 2017, the Office for National Statistics said.June's borrowing figure fell to £5.4bn, which was down from £6.2bn a year ago but was slightly larger than expected.Analysts said borrowing was falling faster than predictions had indicated, pointing to a less austere Budget.Public sector net debt, excluding public sector banks, was £1,792.3bn, equivalent to 85.2% of GDP.That is £33bn higher than a year earlier, but one percentage point lower as a percentage of GDP.""Borrowing is at the lowest level for over a decade, which shows our balanced approach is working,"" the Treasury said in a statement.Over the financial year to March 2019, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which produces the official government forecasts, expects the public sector to borrow £37.1bn.That amounts to about one-quarter of what it borrowed in 2009-10, at the peak of the financial crisis.However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said borrowing was falling faster than the OBR had expected, indicating that Chancellor Philip Hammond had room to change course in the Autumn Budget.He added: ""Borrowing still should come in comfortably below the OBR's forecast this year; we look for borrowing of about £33bn, equal to 1.6% of GDP.  ""Since the chancellor's target merely is to reduce cyclically-adjusted borrowing to below 2% of GDP by 2020-21, he has scope to scrap the remaining austerity measures planned for the next two years. ""Given that the Conservatives now lag Labour in the opinion polls and Brexit must be seen to be a success, we see no reason why the chancellor wouldn't opt to soften his plans in the Budget later this year.""The EY Item Club agreed, saying the chancellor ""may have more room for manoeuvre in November's Budget as he looks to find the extra funding needed for the increased spending promised for the NHS"". Mr Hammond has previously stated that tax rises will be needed for the extra NHS funding, as the government remains committed to bringing down the budget deficit."
2018-07-19,Reality Check: Brexit challenge for Irish trade,https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44657460,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is proving to be a massive challenge in the Brexit negotiations, and talk of ""no deal"" is making a lot of people nervous. But it's not just in the UK that this matters, because the Republic of Ireland depends on trade with the United Kingdom for its economic well-being. There's been a lot of talk about north-south trade across the border with Northern Ireland, and the need to avoid any border checks. But in purely economic terms, east-west trade across the Irish Sea between Ireland and Great Britain is far more important.   The vast majority of freight traffic leaving the Republic of Ireland is exported from Dublin, with the busiest routes to ports such as Liverpool and Holyhead.How much trade are we talking about? One way of measuring it is to look at the data on roll-on roll-off freight containers, many of them carrying food and other retail items that people rely on every day. Roll-on, roll-off (or Ro-Ro) refers to containers transported on lorries or trailers, while lift-on, lift-off (or Lo-Lo) refers to containers that are loaded on to ships by cranes. (And yes, Rolos are still made of chocolate.) Ro-Ro transport is important for produce that needs to get to market quickly, or for just-in-time manufacturing processes that rely on hourly deliveries of components. Ireland's Central Statistics Office released figures on 29 June, which show that in 2017 553,630 loaded Ro-Ro freight containers, on lorries or trailers, were shipped from Ireland to the rest of the world. The vast majority were heading for other ports in the EU. Only a tiny number - 24 - went to ports elsewhere. About 85% of Ireland's total EU freight trade goes via British ports - 475,925 containers last year. We can break that number down a bit further. The Irish Freight Transport Association estimates that the final destination of roughly 60% of the 475,925 freight containers shipped to Britain is Britain itself.That means the other 40% - roughly 190,000 per year - is destined for elsewhere in the EU, transiting across Britain via ports such as Dover or Hull, or via the Channel Tunnel. No-one knows the exact number, although Ireland's Department of Transport has commissioned in-depth research that should be released shortly. But one thing is clear: any kind of breakdown or problem posed by the failure to reach a Brexit agreement could have a huge impact, not just on Ireland's trade with the UK, but also on Ireland's trade with the rest of the EU. Don't forget that in this article we've just looked at Irish exports. Ireland is equally dependent on trade with the UK for its imports.Ireland currently sends lots of its exports to other countries via Britain because it is quicker than doing the whole journey by sea.Could Ireland try to cut out the so-called British land bridge and trade more directly with the rest of the EU? Some steps are already being taken in that direction.  One Luxembourg-based shipping company, CLdN, has just introduced two huge new Ro-Ro freight ferries on the direct sea route from Dublin to the Dutch port of Rotterdam, and to Zeebrugge in Belgium. The new ferries are the largest short-sea Ro-Ro vessels (ones that do not cross oceans) in the world, and can carry 650 cargo units on each voyage.When one of them, the MV Celine, was christened in Dublin in April, the chief executive of Dublin Port Company, Eamonn O'Reilly, said: ""The addition of new ships and sailings shows the shipping sector's resilience and ability to adapt to changing customer needs, particularly in response to Brexit.""""We expect MV Celine will mark the beginning of additional services to continental Europe from Dublin port over the coming years.""  Extra freight capacity is already being phased in on ferry routes between Dublin and Cherbourg, in France, as well as between Cork and Santander, in Spain.  But to give some idea of the extent to which Ireland relies on the British land bridge, statistics from the Port of Dublin show that last year it sent 31,875 loaded Ro-Ro containers to Belgium and Holland, while it sent 188,902 containers to Holyhead alone.So while some contingency plans are already being made, it's not nearly enough to replace the trade that currently goes to or through Britain. And that is a reminder that Ireland needs a good Brexit deal almost as much as the UK does. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-07-19,MPs criticise CPS criminal case failures,https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44892607,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs have criticised the director of public prosecutions over failings in the disclosure of evidence in criminal cases.A number of rape trials collapsed last year after it emerged vital evidence had not been given to defence lawyers. The Justice Select Committee said Alison Saunders did not recognise the severity of the issue and there was ""insufficient leadership"".Ms Saunders said addressing problems in the system was her ""top priority"". She is due to stand down from her post in October at the end of a five-year contract.In the lead-up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence or information that might either help the defence case, or harm the prosecution's case.But the Justice Committee's report said there have been ""persistent problems with the practice of disclosure"".""We have seen at least six reports in as many years that have highlighted issues and made recommendations,"" it said.The committee said that despite this insight, Ms Saunders failed to recognise the extent and seriousness of long-term disclosure failings.  Their report also said the Crown Prosecution Service may have underestimated the number of cases halted because of issues with disclosing evidence. Data from the CPS showed 841 cases in 2017/18 had to be stopped. But the committee said it knows that the true figure is higher - saying the CPS may have underestimated the number by 90%. Committee chairman, Conservative MP Bob Neill, said the police and CPS often see the disclosure of evidence as an ""administrative headache"" - a view which was ""not acceptable"". Mr Neill, a former barrister, added: ""Disclosure failings are extremely damaging for those concerned and can have a permanent life-long impact.""These failings have caused miscarriages of justice and - as the director of public prosecutions even admitted to us - some people have gone to prison as a result.""The committee found failings in the ""application of disclosure by police officers and prosecutors on the ground"" and called for a culture change, so it was seen as a ""core justice duty"", rather than an ""administrative add-on"".When it came to Ms Saunders, the committee said there was ""insufficient focus and leadership"" in dealing with the problem and that she ""did not sufficiently recognise the extent and seriousness"" of failures within the process.The report, published on Friday, also called on the government to look at whether there is sufficient funding for the system. Mr Neill said: ""The proliferation of electronic evidence makes disclosure ever more challenging, and we need the right skills, technology, resources and guidelines, to resolve this once and for all.""The failings are symptomatic of a system under immense strain: without change, we cannot expect the public to have confidence in the criminal justice system.""Responding to the report, Ms Saunders said: ""I have been very clear that addressing the long-standing problems in managing disclosure across the criminal justice system is my top priority.""There is an unprecedented focus on finding solutions, and extensive action has been under way over the past year to bring about the necessary change not just in how cases are handled, but in the wider culture within the CPS and policing.""This is not a quick fix. We will evaluate the measures taken, and agree further commitments to ensure there is continuous improvement.""The National Police Chiefs' Council's lead for criminal justice, Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave, defended Ms Saunders, saying she was ""fully aware of the extent and seriousness of the disclosure failures"" and ""fully committed"" to working with them. Another review into disclosure is being carried out by the attorney general and a National Disclosure Improvement Plan is being put into place.In January, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ordered a review of more than 3,600 cases in England and Wales after four cases were thrown out of court due to a lack of disclosure. The trial of Liam Allan was stopped in December at Croydon Crown Court, days before the prosecution of Isaac Itiary at Inner London Crown Court was halted.And in January, the case against Samson Makele was stopped at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London, while Oxford student Oliver Mears - who had spent two years on bail - had the case against him dropped days before his trial was set to start.The review found that 47 cases of rape and sexual assault had important evidence withheld from the defence."
2018-07-19,New MPs' code 'risks cover-up claims',https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44890194,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMoves to give anonymity to all MPs under investigation risk ""rolling back the openness"" established after the expenses scandal, a senior MP has said.Sir Kevin Barron warned: ""It will be presented as MPs trying to cover up their misdoings.""The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards has listed all MPs being investigated on her website since 2010. Under a new behaviour code to deal with harassment, ongoing inquiries would not be routinely published. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said it was ""not about rolling back transparency"" but that the standards commissioner's role had ""significantly changed"".Under the new code, the standards commissioner would now consider complaints that arose from the new independent complaints and grievance policy (ICGP), as well as allegations of financial misdemeanours and breaches of the existing code of conduct.  The motion put forward by Mrs Leadsom said investigations into complaints of harassment must be confidential, and ""for consistency and fairness, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards should no longer routinely publish information about individual investigations before those investigations are concluded"". ""To have one process for non-ICGP and a separate one for ICGP is simply confusing,"" said Mrs Leadsom.""This is a genuine attempt ... to put confidentiality at the heart, for the sake of the complainant.""Two government ministers - Damian Green and Michael Fallon - resigned over scandals last year, and a number of other politicians on both sides of the House were  investigated over claims of sexual misconduct.A survey of more than 1,300 parliamentary workers published in February found that 19% had experienced or witnessed sexual harassment or inappropriate behaviour in the previous year, with twice as many complaints from women than men.MPs voted through the new code on Thursday, and rejected an amendment by Sir Kevin and other members of the Commons Standards Committee to stop anonymity being applied to all investigations.Sir Kevin said the anonymity was the ""one issue"" on which his committee disagreed with the steering group lead by Mrs Leadsom.""We strongly support the work that has been done to bring Parliament into the modern age in terms of personal conduct,"" he said, adding: ""Not everyone in this institution has behaved in a morally decent way.""   He said they agreed that sexual harassment and bullying investigations should be confidential to give complainants confidence to come forward.But he added: ""We have considered carefully the (Commons) leader's argument for making this change and we understand why she has put them forward, but we do not think that they outweigh the reputational damage that may arise if we go ahead with this proposal as it is stated.""He told MPs: ""The rules were agreed by the House some years ago in the wake of the expenses scandal and were seen as an important way to demonstrate transparency and openness.""He read out a letter from members of his committee who are not MPs, which backed the current practice and said: ""Any proposals to limit this approach would be a detrimental step in continuing to build the credibility of the reputation of the House.""He also said previous efforts by the standards committee to expand the code of conduct to include ""some aspects of personal behaviour"" some years ago had been ""undermined... by what I may call, I suppose,  the forces of reaction.""Labour MP Jess Phillips voiced her concern about the change, telling MPs: ""I do worry about how it looks in trying to pull back on transparency"" and suggested it had been included as part of a deal ""done in order to get this through"". She said, while she had no proof, she believed it was ""a deal done by somebody in a whips office, somebody in a committee that controls one of our political parties"".Green Party MP Caroline Lucas added: ""I do share the sneaking suspicion that was voiced by (Ms Phillips) when she said perhaps there were other forces at play here which are leading us to this direction.""SNP MP Pete Wishart said the issue had been the ""most controversial, the most debated in the group"" and he felt ""conflicted"" about it, and it should be ""at the heart of the six-month review"" of the code.Mrs Leadsom said Westminster had been ""rocked by allegations of bullying and harassment since last November"" and the new behaviour code offered ""a new start"".""Today we can demonstrate our determination to put our House in order and to ensure that in the future everyone will be treated with dignity and respect."""
2018-07-19,New Brexit secretary to 'intensify' talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44880968,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK's new Brexit secretary will hold his first talks with the EU's chief negotiator in Brussels later.Dominic Raab was appointed when David Davis resigned in protest at Theresa May's plans for post-Brexit trade.It now falls to Mr Raab - part of the winning Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum - to continue negotiations with the EU's Michel Barnier.Their meeting comes as the European Commission is instructing other EU states to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.The commission paper warns that failure to reach a deal would have a considerable impact on European business and citizens.Possible consequences, the paper says, include disruption to the aviation industry and goods from the UK being subject to custom checks.Speaking to MPs before setting off for Brussels, Mr Raab said he hoped Mr Barnier would ""fully support"" the proposals for post-Brexit trade with the EU in the government's White Paper.But he added the UK was stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit and would shortly be publishing advice for businesses on how to cope with it to minimise ""disruption"".Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said his government is also making contingency plans for ""the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit"".Mr Varadkar said that - even if there is a deal - Ireland will need 1,000 new customs officers and veterinary inspectors to deal with changes in trade rules with the UK.In the UK, the government has advised all its departments to have fully planned contingencies in place in the event of the UK withdrawing from the EU without an agreement.However the government watchdog, the National Audit Office, has warned that, in the case of one department, there is ""still much to do"".On Thursday, Theresa May will be making her first visit to the Irish border since the Brexit referendum. No 10 says the visit will ""reaffirm her commitment to a Brexit that avoids a hard border and protects the Belfast Agreement"".The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.But the two sides have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved. Mr Raab's trip to Brussels comes with debate raging within the Conservative Party about what Brexit should look like.By Katya Adler, the BBC's Europe EditorIt will be quite a baptism of fire for the new Brexit secretary. He will be greeted here in Brussels with a barrage of questions. First and foremost amid all the political turmoil in Westminster: What exactly is the UK's Brexit negotiating position now? The EU also has a strong message for Dominic Raab.Work with us, they will say, to finish the UK's exit deal - the so-called Withdrawal Agreement - otherwise the chances are rising of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal come March next year.On Wednesday, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who also quit over the proposals presented to the cabinet at Chequers - used his resignation speech to accuse Theresa May of ""dithering"" over the UK's strategy for leaving the EU.""It is not too late to save Brexit"", he said, calling for the government to ""change tack"".Former Remain supporters, on the other hand, were furious when the government changed its Customs Bill this week to comply with the demands of a Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs.The EU says it will analyse the Chequers proposals, which were set out in full in a White Paper, before coming up with a response.Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr Raab urged MPs to back Theresa May's plans.He said: ""What we now should all do on all sides of this chamber is not call for second referendums, not call for returning to the customs union, but get behind the government's plan, show some united front, so we get the very best deal for everyone in this country."""
2018-07-19,Windrush compensation 'could be capped',https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44888187,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowCompensation promised to the victims of the Windrush scandal could be capped under government proposals.Launching a 12-week consultation on a compensation scheme, the Home Office said a cap would ensure no-one got a ""disproportionately high payment"".But Labour said some victims had been left destitute and needed urgent help.Many migrants from Commonwealth countries were wrongly declared illegal immigrants, despite having been granted permission to settle in the UK. As a result some were threatened with deportation, the loss of their jobs, and others were denied benefits and healthcare on the NHS. Migrants from the Commonwealth Caribbean were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s.In May it was revealed that at least 63 members of the Windrush generation - named after the boat that brought the first Caribbean migrants to the UK - had been wrongfully removed since 2002.Under the proposed compensation scheme, fees from unsuccessful immigration applications could be compensated. The refusal of benefits payments, denial of healthcare on the NHS, and issues with social housing would also be considered under the proposed scheme. But in its current form these payments would be capped to ""ensure that no individual receives a disproportionately high payment from the public purse"".The government has also suggested a ""minimum size of claim"" to avoid high costs on processing ""low value claims"". ""We believe that both these measures would help to avoid any excessively high payments and protect the taxpayer from processing very low value claims,"" the proposal said.The compensation scheme will also take into account stress, anxiety and depression that was caused to individuals uncertain of whether they would be allowed to live in the UK. Eligibility for compensation would mirror the Windrush Scheme, which was set up by the Home Office to help migrants establish their lawful status. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Today marks an important milestone in our efforts to right the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation - who have made such a massive contribution to the UK.""He added he hoped it would ""help to right the wrongs suffered by those of the Windrush generation who have faced difficulties and suffered losses as a result of measures that are in place to tackle illegal immigration"".The consultation will run for 12 weeks and people and those affected are encouraged to give their views.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Mr Javid and said victims ""cannot wait until October for a consultation to be concluded on the government's promised compensation scheme"".She added that victims had been left ""destitute"" by the scandal, and accused the government of ""dragging its feet""."
2018-07-19,Parents may lose rights over sex ed at 15,https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-44886271,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government plans to let 15-year-olds overrule their parents' wishes and opt in to sex education lessons they have previously been withdrawn from.Education Secretary Damian Hinds says children should be able to request sex education in at least one of the three terms before their 16th birthday.Until then, parents will retain the right to withdraw their children.The plan was announced as part of new draft guidelines on the teaching of sex education in England's schools.These new, wider guidelines have been developed following concerns the existing guidance, last updated 18 years ago, does not cover topics such as:The guidelines, to become compulsory from 2020, are now open to consultation.In an oral statement to the Commons on Thursday, Mr Hinds said: ""We've previously committed to parents having a right to withdraw their children from the sex education part of RSE [relationships and sex education], but not from relationships education, in either primary or secondary school.""A right for parents to withdraw their child up to 18 years of age is no longer compatible with English case law nor with the European Convention on Human Rights.""It's also clear that allowing parents to withdraw their child up to age 16 would not allow the child to opt into sex education before the legal age of consent.""I therefore propose to give parents the right to request their child be withdrawn from sex education delivered as part of RSE.""And the draft guidance sets out that - unless their are exceptional circumstances - the parents' request should be granted until three terms before the pupil reaches 16.""At that point, if the child wishes to have sex education, the head teacher should ensure they receive it in one of those three terms.""This preserves the parental right, in most cases, but also balances it with the child's right to opt into sex education once they are competent to do so.""Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said she welcomed the move but suggested children should be allowed to opt in confidentially in such circumstances.""I welcome the statement that children have the right to decide that they want to receive sex and relationship education,"" she said.""All children should be empowered to make healthy, informed decisions, to know that it's not wrong to be LGBT and not acceptable to experience gendered harassment or violence.""But can he assure the House that pupils will be able to opt in confidentially if this is their choice?""Responding to her comments, Mr Hinds said: ""We're not expecting large numbers of cases where this is true.""The child would be able to access a term of sex education before reaching 16.""Mr Hinds also said health education would become a mandatory part of the curriculum for all primary and secondary schools from autumn 2020.Under the plans,  pupils will learn about mental health and developing skills such as confidence and resilience.  It comes amid growing concerns about mental health issues among young people.Classes will also cover physical health, such as the importance of exercise and healthy eating and the benefits of a healthy lifestyle as well as preventing health problems.Mr Hinds said: ""I want to make sure that our children are able to grow up to become happy and well rounded individuals who know how to deal with the challenges of the modern world. ""Part of this is making sure they are informed about how to keep themselves safe and healthy and have good relationships with others."""

It includes advice on how countries, companies and individuals should prepare for the prospect of the UK leaving with ""no deal"" in place. BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris has read the document so you don't have to. Here are some key excerpts, and explanations of what they mean: From the outset, the EU makes one thing clear - even if negotiations go better than expected, it thinks there will be significant disruption, and everyone needs to be ready for it. (The EU talks about 30 March as exit day, by the way, because the precise time of withdrawal is due to be midnight on 30 March in Central European Time, but 23:00 on 29 March in GMT). The document emphasises that negotiations on a withdrawal agreement are continuing and that a negotiated settlement is the EU's preferred outcome.But it also notes that important issues remain unresolved - including on the protection of personal data sent to the UK while it was a member state and on the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in policing a withdrawal agreement. In particular, it states that there has been ""no progress"" in agreeing a ""backstop"" solution to avoid the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The EU notes, as it has done many times before, that time to both reach and ratify an agreement is running short. This is why preparations for ""no deal"" are so important. If there is a deal, there will also be a transition period running until 31 December 2020 during which EU rules and regulations will continue to apply in the UK. That will give businesses and governments more time to prepare for a new relationship. Without a deal, the transition (or ""implementation period"" as the UK government calls it) falls away and the relationship will change abruptly at the end of March next year. If both sides come to the conclusion several months before the end of March that there will be ""no deal"", they can at least make some contingency plans to deal with that. But if there is a last-minute hitch, time will have run out. So, from the EU's perspective, thinking about ""no deal"" means ""preparing for the worst and hoping for the best"". Much of the UK government would probably look at it in the same way - but there are many Brexiteers who think that ""no deal"" would be perfectly acceptable as long as sufficient preparations have been made.  This kind of language is scattered throughout the document. ""Don't say we didn't warn you,"" would be another way of putting it. The document stresses that some things will have to be done whatever the outcome. One thing it mentions is the need for companies to take steps to ensure that they have the right authorisations and certificates to access the EU market after Brexit. But contingency planning for ""no deal"" is the main emphasis - the EU says this is a prudent step because the outcome of negotiations ""cannot be predicted"". Among other issues, it notes that there would be no arrangement in place for EU citizens in the UK or UK citizens in the EU. It says controls at borders ""could cause significant delays, eg in road transport, and difficulties for ports"", where there could be ""long lines of vehicles waiting for customs procedures to be fulfilled"". It also says that the UK would become a third country for trade and regulatory issues, which would ""represent a significant drawback compared to the current level of market integration"". It also emphasises that while many measures would have to be taken at EU level, national, regional and local governments also need to step up their levels of preparation to ""mitigate the worst impacts of a potential cliff-edge scenario"" - cheerful stuff. And of course a lot of the attention is focused on making sure that individual EU businesses, big and small, are going to be ready for whatever emerges at the end of a highly unpredictable process of negotiation. The document notes that several EU governments, such as the Irish and the Dutch, have set up online platforms to help their companies prepare for different potential Brexit scenarios. The document also claims - in a sentence that won't please the UK government - that ""many companies are relocating to the EU27"" or expanding their operations there. EU officials insist that they are not trying to add fuel to the fire and that they are simply engaged in prudent planning. But it's a reminder that there are people in Europe, as well as in the UK, who see Brexit as an opportunity rather than a threat. The commission has now published 68 notices (anyone with a few hours to spare can read them here) on preparations in specific sectors of the economy, including health and food safety, financial services, customs, transport, and company law. They set out the legal and technical issues that governments and companies need to take into account and are another glimpse into the complexities of Brexit that stretch into every area of economic life.  In the UK, the government has not yet published any comparable information of its own.However, on Wednesday, Theresa May told MPs at the Liaison Committee that a similar number of technical notifications about what to do in the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit will be released during August and September - aimed at businesses and citizens.In response to the EU document, the Department for Exiting the European Union said ""It is the duty of any responsible government to prepare for every eventuality, including the unlikely scenario that we reach March 2019 without agreeing a deal. We have already done a lot of work behind the scenes to prepare for this - it is only natural that our European partners would seek to make similar preparations. We are keen to work closely with the EU on preparedness issues.""There are all sorts of EU databases, including many dealing with policing and internal security issues, to which the UK wants to retain access after Brexit. But the EU has argued that the UK can't simply pick and choose the bits of membership it likes - and this part of the document emphasises that work is well under way to remove the UK from numerous databases and IT systems once it becomes a ""third country"". The commission is also making preparations for changing international agreements that currently involve the UK as a member state. It says it will notify its international partners formally once it has sufficient certainty about the outcome of the current negotiations - not for a while, then. Finally, the EU document says work is under way to relocate or reassign tasks that are currently performed in the UK - such as the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre (part of the EU's project for satellites in space) or the UK-based EU Reference Laboratories - because it will not be possible ""to entrust a third country"" with such EU tasks after the withdrawal date. Two London-based agencies, the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority, are already moving to Amsterdam and Paris respectively. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-07-19,Profile: Ian Paisley,https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44885043,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIan Paisley's sanction for breaking parliamentary rules, which could see him suspended from the House of Commons for 30 days, is the latest chapter in a political career that has combined controversy with huge popularity at the ballot box.The youngest child of Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) founder Ian Paisley, Ian Paisley Jr entered elected politics in 1996 and took over as MP for his father's former North Antrim constituency in 2010.But controversy - whether surrounding his views on homosexuality or allegations of lobbying on a £50m government land deal - has never been far away.If he is suspended from the Commons for failing to declare the details of two family holidays in 2013 - paid for by the Sri Lankan government - it could deprive Theresa May's government of a crucial vote in crunch Brexit debates.Mr Paisley and his nine DUP colleagues in Westminster found themselves cast as kingmakers after the Conservative party fell short of a majority in the 2017 general election, which led to a confidence-and-supply deal between the two parties.The youngest of five children, Mr Paisley's interest in unionist politics was evident long before his election to the Northern Ireland Forum in 1996.After attending Shaftesbury House College and Methodist College Belfast, he studied modern history and Irish politics at Queen's University Belfast.During his time as a student, he made a very public demonstration against the dropping of God Save the Queen from graduation ceremonies.He and Peter Weir, now a DUP colleague, stood during the ceremony and played the British national anthem on a small tape recorder.ResignationIn 1998, he was elected to the new Northern Ireland Assembly, easing home on the second count behind his father, who topped the poll.In 2007, on the same day his father became first minister of Northern Ireland, he was appointed a junior minister in the devolved administration.But he served less than a year in the post before resigning, following criticism of his links to developer Seymour Sweeney, on whose behalf he allegedly lobbied over a £50m government land deal in his constituency.An ombudsman ruled there was no evidence to suggest he had broken assembly rules, but he stepped down, saying: ""The criticism has been a distraction and has got in the way of the activities of this government and importantly it has gotten in the way of the activities of my political party.""Mr Paisley's personal views have been the subject of criticism, particularly his opinions on homosexuality.In 2005 he was formally censured by the Northern Ireland Policing Board for describing homosexual relationships as ""immoral, offensive and obnoxious.""Two years later, he was accused by Sinn Féin of ""dangerous homophobia"" after being quoted in Ireland's Hot Press magazine as saying: ""I am pretty repulsed by gay and lesbianism. I think it is wrong.""In 2011, Mr Paisley said his views had changed: He told The House magazine that he had ""grown up"" since those comments.""I have huge respect for people no matter what their religious and social background,"" he said.""I think I have grown up since then. I have strong Christian beliefs and moral viewpoints, but you have to realise that while sin is black and white, life is a lot of grey.""He also faced criticism after saying police officers should ""shoot dissident republicans on sight"", later adding that officers ""should have the opportunity to employ lethal force against those who would seek to kill them.""But the controversies have done nothing to damage his popularity with voters in North Antrim. In 2010, he was elected as the MP for the constituency and has been re-elected twice since then. At the 2017 general election he cruised to victory with 59% of the vote.Following his censure over failing to declare details of his Sri Lankan holidays, many constituents told the BBC they remained supportive of the father-of-four, who has been married to paediatric nurse Fiona since 1990.Along with a passion for motorbikes, he lists his interests in Who's Who as his children, Chinese food, cinema and rugby.Despite being the son of the DUP's founder, Mr Paisley has not felt constrained to toe the party line on all occasions. When former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness retired in January 2017, Mr Paisley's tributes were notably warmer than many other unionist politicians.He told BBC NI's The View programme he wanted to thank former IRA commander Mr McGuinness, who struck a historic power-sharing deal with his father in 2007.His profile was raised after last year's DUP-Conservative deal, and he has been a strong supporter of Brexit, and US President Donald Trump.During the annual St Patrick's Day celebrations at the White House, Mr Paisley tweeted that he was the ""only person from NI to be invited to a private family reception"".He also invited Mr Trump to visit Northern Ireland and posted a selfie with First Lady Melania Trump on Twitter. Mr Paisley's interaction with another famous Twitter user saw him come under fire: He apologised after retweeting a comment by right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins, which read: ""March 2018. London has a higher murder rate than New York... and Ramadan's not yet begun.""He later deleted the comment and apologised, saying he had ""did not take cognisance of Ramadan reference"".That apology was followed on Thursday by an emotional statement in the House of Commons in which he admitted a ""deep personal embarrassment"" following the Sri Lankan holiday rule breach.He could now face a by-election for his seat in North Antrim, where his popularity with voters, undimmed until now, would be tested in different circumstances.

2018-07-19,What was the goal?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44871637,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt's the first Boris Johnson speech that I can remember watching that didn't have any jokes. For his allies, that was the point. It wasn't designed, they say, to make a personal attack on Theresa May. But my goodness, it made a pretty savage attack on her policies - a ""fog of self-doubt"", ""pretending to the electorate"", ""a fantastical Heath Robinson"" proposal on customs, ""miserable permanent limbo"".For someone who less than a fortnight ago celebrated collective cabinet responsibility at Chequers, that's quite some feat.But it makes me wonder exactly what was being said on the Chequers terrace when we captured Mr Johnson and Mrs May in what looked like vigorous conversation 10 days ago. What the speech today was designed to do, his supporters hope, was to present the former foreign secretary without the wisecracks, as a serious politician who is determined to argue for what he believes. His now small band of supporters circled him on the green benches as he spoke. He made the case for the Prime Minister's first big Brexit plan, her speech at Lancaster House back in January 2017 when she first outlined some of her aims and explicitly, completely and totally ruled out staying in the single market. For some Brexiteers Mr Johnson's words will be hugely welcome, a call to stop the rot as they would see it. One former minister told me plainly ""he was right - Lancaster House is a distant memory"", even comparing Mr Johnson's words to the closing scene of Gladiator when Russell Crowe playing the former all powerful Roman General Maximus, bloodied and staggering, said, ""there was a dream that was Rome that shall be realized"".The message, one man's dream can inspire a great many others to glory. Forget for a moment it didn't exactly end well for that particular Roman. But the question this afternoon is whether the speech can start the process of restoring Boris Johnson to his former political glory and more importantly of course, will it make a blind bit of difference to Brexit. On the first point, as Mr Johnson sat down along with some cheers, I heard another MP though call, ""is that it?"" His many critics will point to what was not in the speech, a new plan for Brexit. A government minister told me it was more of his ""deluded fantasy"" saying his ""simplistic notions"" about what could be achieved when we leave the EU won't compensate for what we could lose. Another MP told me ""it didn't really go anywhere, it had no substance"". The other crucial difference in pushing for the Lancaster House model is that it ignores the not inconsiderable fact that that speech and that set of proposals was developed before the general election, before Theresa May shot herself in the foot. Mr Johnson however will, after today's speech, be a well-known, prominent voice who has made it plain he will fight against the prime minister's current stance and any attempts to compromise further. With the turmoil in the Tory party, having him on the loose could, in time, make a difference. Not least, he is one of the few politicians in the country who is known, for good or for ill, by his first name. That is as much of a risk as an asset but it's real, and those who supported Brexit may well listen.For him, today was not about intentionally blasting into a leadership race, but trying to rebuild a new, for the want of a better word, brand of Boris Johnson. The clownish caricature that saw him through much of his time as Mayor of London and the referendum didn't wash as foreign secretary. After that, the number of MPs he excites as a potential leader is tiny these days. But today's speech was not an immediate call but a pitch to get him back in the long term game. It seems unlikely right now after the last couple of years. But one of his detractors grudgingly admitted ""he's never quite the busted flush"". "

But do they make a difference to getting on in politics?""I think that in this chamber a Brummie accent is a very rare thing. And I look forward to changing that!""So said Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, when she gave her maiden speech in the House of Commons in 2015.Accents are rich in sound but, as Ms Phillips emphasised, they are heavy in baggage that we load on to others and others load on to us.But do we all have an accent, wherever we come from?""We do. It is linguistically impossible to not have an accent,"" Rob Drummond, a linguist at Manchester Metropolitan University, says.""But the very fact that some people think they don't have an accent tells us something interesting about society. Because the people who think they don't, tend to be the people who have an accent from around the south-east of England.""This is still perceived as some kind of a standard way of speaking, but of course the only way it is perceived to be standard is because it is where the seat of power - between London and Oxford and Cambridge - traditionally has been.""There are MPs who have had problems being understood in the Commons. Alan Brown, the SNP MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun in Ayrshire is one. So too is Emma Lewell-Buck, who has been the Labour MP for South Shields on Tyneside since 2013.""Hansard would often ask for clarification. I type my speeches out in full now, to make Hansard's job easier, for clarity,"" Ms Lewell-Buck says, referring to the team that transcribes every word spoken in Parliament.""I think there are a hell of a lot more accents and regional voices in there, even in the time I've been in there,"" she adds. ""It makes it more a vibrant Parliament. It makes it sound like the country it represents a bit more.""But both Mr Brown and Ms Lewell-Buck have encountered the same thing back in their constituencies: surprise from locals that their MP sounds like they do. A welcome surprise, but a surprise nonetheless.It is a ""snobbery element in reverse"", reflects Mr Brown.I am fascinated by accents.Not just because I am intensely proud of my roots in the Yorkshire Dales, but because as a reporter, voice is more than just our vocal fingerprint. On the radio it is the whole professional ""us"".And believe me, you become very aware, very early on in a career in my game, that phonetic diversity matters. It is a badge of difference, for better or worse.I will never forget the observation from my year as a trainee in 2001 when I found out a kindly soul had predicted of my future: ""He won't get on the air with a voice like that."" As it happens, I rather suspect I have been incredibly fortunate in my timing - my career starting at just the point it was seen to be fashionable to have more regional accents in broadcasting. I also suspect there is probably a greater prejudice in our industry now against voices perceived to be posh.But is this hang-up about accents uniquely British? No, it turns out. Philippe Blanchet, a professor of linguistics at the University of Rennes, says French presidents ""speak with a neutral, standardised pronunciation, which is based on the one that comes from the higher classes in Paris"".""They are not supposed to have an accent. Because in France when people say you have an accent, it means that you don't use the standardised pronunciation,"" he says, adding: ""The least accepted accents in France are those of the northern part of the country and those from working-class urban and rural parts of the country.""A rather familiar observation...So, could a UK prime minister ever have a Brummie accent?I do not say this with a huge amount of conviction, but I think the answer is, probably, possibly, yes. If they were seen by their party and the country to be a worthy leader on every other metric of these things, maybe they could turn their accent to their advantage, claim it to be the very essence of modernity and a new politics.And yet, there is still evidence that prejudice could stand in their way. A poll by YouGov in 2014 put the Brummie accent at the bottom of a league table for ""the most attractive accents in the British Isles"".It is one of the reasons why I wrote ""probably, possibly"" a few sentences ago."
2018-07-19,At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44858385,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWith the UK on course to leave the European Union in March next year, the country faces four possible scenarios.The UK and the EU both insist they want as amicable a divorce as possible, with a legal agreement setting out the kind of relationship they will have when the UK is no longer a member of the club.Prime Minister Theresa May wants to keep close ties with the EU in certain areas, such as trade in agricultural products and allowing skilled migrants access to jobs in the UK.She says her plan will allow Britain to take back control of its laws, money and borders, just like people voted for in the 2016 EU referendum, while also allowing as ""frictionless"" trade as possible and avoiding a physical border for Northern Ireland.But it has been attacked as an unworkable compromise by people from both the Remain and Leave ends of the debate.The EU may also decide to reject it, but the two sides are still hoping to strike some kind of deal by the autumn and, despite criticism and ministerial resignations, Mrs May believes this is the best option.A clean break with the EU. The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade.UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States.Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world.But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops.  The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019.To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. Leading EU figures have hinted that Brexit could be halted. It would need all the other EU member states to agree.A less formal version of this option would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue.The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - including Justine Greening.With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.Please upgrade your browser"
2018-07-19,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-19,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180720184034/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"".

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

There's no justification for us to create additional burdens on business just because the UK wants to leave."" Mr Barnier questioned the UK's plans for a ""common rulebook"" for EU-UK trade as it only referred to goods checked at the border, not areas like pesticide use, adding: ""How can we protect consumers in Europe?""He also questioned whether the plans were workable without additional bureaucracy and said there were ""practical problems"" about how tariffs would be determined and collected - under the UK's plan, EU member states would collect tariffs on the UK's behalf and vice versa.But Mr Barnier suggested the EU's controversial ""backstop"" proposal aimed at avoiding a hard Irish border could be changed: ""There will be a deal if there is an agreement on the backstop. ""It's not necessarily our backstop. We can work on this, amend it, improve our backstop ... But we need an operational backstop now, in the Withdrawal Agreement, and not later.""Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg described Mr Barnier's speech as ""aggressive"" in a tweet:Today's aggressive comments by Messrs Varadkar and Barnier show why we are right to be leaving the mafia-like European Union.End of Twitter post  by @Jacob_Rees_MoggOn a visit to Belfast on Friday, Theresa May said the ""seamless border"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic was ""a foundation stone on which the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement rests"" and the concept of a hard border was now ""almost inconceivable"".But she reiterated her opposition to the EU's ""backstop"" proposal, that would see Northern Ireland effectively staying in the single market for goods and the customs union, as ""something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept"". And she dismissed suggestions made by former foreign secretary Boris Johnson that technology could be used to avoid the need for a hard border: ""No technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border.""She said the White Paper was a ""significant development"" of the UK's position and offered a ""coherent package"".""It is now for the EU to respond - not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind.""And, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions.""Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Ireland's RTE radio there had been a ""lukewarm"" response in Brussels to the UK White Paper.He added: ""We don't have any British proposal in terms of a functioning backstop in its entirety. We have bits and pieces of ideas."""
2018-07-20,EU must 'evolve' Brexit position - PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20180721012202/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44892385,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe European Union must ""evolve"" its position on Brexit and not fall back on unworkable proposals regarding the Irish border, Theresa May has said.The prime minister made the remarks in Belfast on Friday, during a two-day visit to Northern Ireland.The issue of the Irish border has been the key sticking point in Brexit talks so far.The UK and EU have agreed that there should be no hard border in Ireland, but are at odds over how to achieve it.The backstop solution is effectively an insurance policy -  to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if appropriate customs arrangements cannot be agreed by the EU and UK in time for the end of the transition period in December 2020.The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system.However, the UK said that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea.On Friday, Mrs May again repeated her opposition to that, saying: ""The economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal 'third country' customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and believe no British prime minister could ever accept"".She also said both sides in the negotiation  ""share a determination never to see a hard border in Northern Ireland"".""And no technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet, or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border"".However, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has questioned Mrs May's plan for a future trade relationship with the EU, saying it could weaken the single market and create burdens for business.He said the UK's Brexit White Paper, published on 12 July, opened ""the way to a constructive discussion"" but must be ""workable"".Mr Barnier questioned whether plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical.Earlier this week, the government backed an amendment to its Customs Bill that would make it illegal for Northern Ireland to be outside the UK's customs territory. Mrs May said the EU's backstop proposal would be a breach of the Belfast Agreement - and that her plan, agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers earlier this month, was the best way forward.If UK Govt don’t support current EU wording on Backstop in draft Withdrawal Agreement, then obligation is on them to propose a viable and legally operable alternative wording that delivers same result: no border infrastructure. Clear UK commitments were made on this in Dec+March.End of Twitter post  by @simoncoveney""What I've said to the EU is that the legal text they've produced is not acceptable, that's why we proposed an alternative to that,"" she said.She said there now needed to be a renewed focus on EU-UK negotiations with ""increased pace and intensity"".The prime minister also met several of the political parties in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald said the visit was ""anything but reassuring"".""In fact it's now clear the British prime minister has come here to pick a fight with Ireland and to pick a fight with the EU,"" Mrs McDonald said.However, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, defended the prime minister.""What she has done is set out her agenda, that's very important. She talked about working together to find solutions, and the need to work collaboratively,"" she said.Theresa May wants a backstop that would see the whole of the UK staying in the customs union for a limited period of time after the transition period - something the EU has said is unacceptable.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme the government was committed to getting a legal text for a backstop.Earlier, the Irish Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney tweeted that if the UK did not accept the EU wording on a backstop in the draft withdrawal agreement, they would have to propose an  alternative that would deliver the same result. .@theresa_may arrived to protesters shouting “your rights, our rights” @BBCNewsNI @bbcnewsline pic.twitter.com/JJwBFGFs2LEnd of Twitter post  by @KellyBonnerReacting to his comments, Mrs Bradley said while the EU had put forward a legal text, ""we do not accept it"". ""We've put forward a counter proposal and we're now working on how we get a backstop that we are committed to delivering but it has to be a backstop that respects the integrity of the whole UK and does not put a border in the Irish sea.""The Shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd, told the BBC Labour had always been ""very clear"" that the UK should be part of the customs union. EU and UK negotiators have been meeting in Brussels this week to discuss the border issue.Friday's speech in Northern Ireland marks the prime minister's first major attempt to sell the Chequers agreement since it was reached by her cabinet earlier this month.She is due to tour other parts of the UK over the summer in an attempt to persuade businesses and citizens of its benefits.Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit.The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards.But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date of 29 March 2019 fast approaching.The Republic of Ireland will remain within the EU and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said his government is making contingency plans for ""the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit"".Mrs May also addressed the impasse at Stormont.Northern Ireland has been without a government for 18 months, after power-sharing between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin collapsed.She added that until devolution is restored, the government would fulfil its responsibilities but warned interventions from Westminster were ""no substitute"" in the long-term."
2018-07-20,PM's whip excuse blatantly untrue - Labour,https://web.archive.org//web/20180721012202/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44897844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour's deputy leader Tom Watson has accused Theresa May of making ""blatantly untrue excuses"" for the behaviour of her chief whip.Mr Watson said the PM's defence of Julian Smith was ""unbelievable"" and public trust in politics was at stake.Mr Smith is under fire after telling a Tory MP to take part in a key Brexit vote, despite an agreement not to with a Lib Dem MP on maternity leave.Pressed on Friday, the PM repeated her claim it was an ""honest mistake"".Pairing is an informal arrangement between two MPs of opposing parties that allows them, with the agreement of the whips (whips are the MPs responsible for discipline in each party), to miss occasional votes in the House - for example if they are ill, off on leave or out of the country.Mr Lewis, who was paired with the Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson, did not take part in most of Tuesday's Trade Bill votes, but did take part in the two closest divisions - one on customs, which the government won by just six votes, and another on medicine regulation, which it lost.Both he and Mr Smith have apologised to Ms Swinson, who gave birth to her second son Gabriel on 29 June and is on maternity leave, saying it was an ""honest mistake"".Asked whether she endorsed her chief whip's conduct, Mrs May said: ""There was an honest mistake made for which the chief whip and Brandon Lewis have both apologised to the member concerned.""By BBC political correspondent Chris MasonThere is an old saying in politics. When you are explaining, you are losing.The Conservatives have been doing a lot of explaining on this pairing row.Tory sources are drawing a distinction between ""long-term"" pairing arrangements, such as those covering maternity leave which are sacrosanct, and ""short-term"" arrangements which, they argue, are frequently breached by all sides.The twist is they broke the long-term pair with Jo Swinson ""by accident,"" and while they acknowledge Julian Smith did ""explore and possibly instruct"" shorter-term pairs to be broken, none actually were.Labour, to put it politely, say this is rubbish. ""This is about trust and honour,"" a source tells me. ""Julian Smith has tried to cheat, and should resign.""Some Conservatives too are pretty angry. ""Tacky,"" ""dishonest,"" ""appalling"" and ""concerning"" are among the words used by some.But a government struggling to get its business through the Commons can ill afford to lose the man whose very job it is ensure it wins those votes.But they have faced furious criticism - both from Labour and the Lib Dems, and some Tory MPs - amid suspicion Mr Smith deliberately ordered MPs to break their pairing deals because the votes were so important.Labour deputy leader Mr Watson said on Friday: ""It is unbelievable that the prime minister has repeated the desperate and blatantly untrue excuses made by her party chair and chief whip.""This is a serious issue that goes beyond efficient administration in the House of Commons. This is about public trust in politics. At such a crucial time for our country, people expect candour and decency, not cowardice and dishonesty.""He said if Mr Lewis and Mr Smith would not resign, Mrs May ""should find the strength to sack them"".""From forcing seriously ill MPs into the Commons in their wheelchairs, carrying sick buckets, to cheating a new mum out of her vote, this government is rotten to its core."" The Lib Dems have called on chief whip Mr Smith to explain himself after reports he told Mr Lewis and two other Tory MPs that they should go ahead and vote, despite being paired. Two of the MPs are reported to have refused to break their pairing arrangements.Conservative backbencher Philip Davies, who on Thursday became the third Conservative to declare publicly that he has submitted a letter of no confidence in Theresa May's leadership, told BBC Newsnight he had had his ""differences"" with the chief whip.But he said Mr Smith had ""always been completely honourable, decent, I have never questioned his integrity once"".""My understanding is that in this Parliament alone the pairings have been broken over 50 times .. and the overwhelming majority of those times, it was broken by opposition parties,"" he added.Referring to the absence of the Lib Dem leader and his predecessor from Tuesday's votes, Mr Davies said: ""I think this is a diversion tactic from the Lib Dems because Vince Cable and Tim Farron couldn't be bothered to turn up for a vote.""But other Conservative MPs, including Anna Soubry, Peter Bone and Heidi Allen, have also raised concerns. Mrs Allen said the chief whip had been ""unable to confirm to me that he did not give instructions to break pairs"" and she could ""only conclude MPs were told to break pairs on Tuesday"".""I refuse to be tarnished by this behaviour so will not stand by and say nothing. Integrity and honesty are fundamental to our democracy. Anything less is unacceptable."""

The UK is hoping the EU will back the proposals so an exit deal can be struck by the autumn, ahead of the UK's official departure from the EU in March.But the proposals, including a ""common rule book"" between the two sides, angered many Tory MPs. Mrs Leadsom, who campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 EU referendum, told The House the prime minister was ""planning to engage quite strongly"" with Brexiteers over the next few days to ""help them to understand"" why the Irish border is a serious issue.She said it was incumbent on the government to ""make the case"" for the Chequers agreement - but that the EU must know that it was a final offer.""The EU has simply not taken us seriously so far in terms of the future agreement.""What this deal does is it says to them, 'right, now we can have a free trading area where there won't be the need for border checks and controls'.""It's saying to the EU, 'you better take this seriously'. In my view, it's take this seriously or we are heading for no deal. The message to the EU has to be, 'this is the final offer'.""Please upgrade your browserShe said the EU were not going to ""wriggle away at it and we're going to accept it. It is a very hard and fast offer to the EU that makes sense for them.""But if they don't accept it, we're also ramping up our no deal preparations. That's where we will be heading and they will have forced us to do that.""My message to the EU is, 'take this seriously because otherwise, you're forcing us down the road of no deal'.""Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit.The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards.But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date fast approaching."

""Their use is governed by a strict legal framework.""Throughout any deployment and beyond, the welfare of the young person is the paramount consideration."""
2018-07-20,UK government borrowing at 11-year low,https://web.archive.org//web/20180721012202/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44898624,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowGovernment borrowing in the April-to-June period fell to its lowest level since 2007, official figures show.Borrowing for the financial year so far has reached £16.8bn, £5.4bn less than in the same period in 2017, the Office for National Statistics said.June's borrowing figure fell to £5.4bn, which was down from £6.2bn a year ago but was slightly larger than expected.Analysts said borrowing was falling faster than predictions had indicated, pointing to a less austere Budget.Public sector net debt, excluding public sector banks, was £1,792.3bn, equivalent to 85.2% of GDP.That is £33bn higher than a year earlier, but one percentage point lower as a percentage of GDP.""Borrowing is at the lowest level for over a decade, which shows our balanced approach is working,"" the Treasury said in a statement.Over the financial year to March 2019, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which produces the official government forecasts, expects the public sector to borrow £37.1bn.That amounts to about one-quarter of what it borrowed in 2009-10, at the peak of the financial crisis.However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said borrowing was falling faster than the OBR had expected, indicating that Chancellor Philip Hammond had room to change course in the Autumn Budget.He added: ""Borrowing still should come in comfortably below the OBR's forecast this year; we look for borrowing of about £33bn, equal to 1.6% of GDP.  ""Since the chancellor's target merely is to reduce cyclically-adjusted borrowing to below 2% of GDP by 2020-21, he has scope to scrap the remaining austerity measures planned for the next two years. ""Given that the Conservatives now lag Labour in the opinion polls and Brexit must be seen to be a success, we see no reason why the chancellor wouldn't opt to soften his plans in the Budget later this year.""The EY Item Club agreed, saying the chancellor ""may have more room for manoeuvre in November's Budget as he looks to find the extra funding needed for the increased spending promised for the NHS"". Mr Hammond has previously stated that tax rises will be needed for the extra NHS funding, as the government remains committed to bringing down the budget deficit."
2018-07-20,Reality Check: Brexit challenge for Irish trade,https://web.archive.org//web/20180721012202/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44657460,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is proving to be a massive challenge in the Brexit negotiations, and talk of ""no deal"" is making a lot of people nervous. But it's not just in the UK that this matters, because the Republic of Ireland depends on trade with the United Kingdom for its economic well-being. There's been a lot of talk about north-south trade across the border with Northern Ireland, and the need to avoid any border checks. But in purely economic terms, east-west trade across the Irish Sea between Ireland and Great Britain is far more important.   The vast majority of freight traffic leaving the Republic of Ireland is exported from Dublin, with the busiest routes to ports such as Liverpool and Holyhead.How much trade are we talking about? One way of measuring it is to look at the data on roll-on roll-off freight containers, many of them carrying food and other retail items that people rely on every day. Roll-on, roll-off (or Ro-Ro) refers to containers transported on lorries or trailers, while lift-on, lift-off (or Lo-Lo) refers to containers that are loaded on to ships by cranes. (And yes, Rolos are still made of chocolate.) Ro-Ro transport is important for produce that needs to get to market quickly, or for just-in-time manufacturing processes that rely on hourly deliveries of components. Ireland's Central Statistics Office released figures on 29 June, which show that in 2017 553,630 loaded Ro-Ro freight containers, on lorries or trailers, were shipped from Ireland to the rest of the world. The vast majority were heading for other ports in the EU. Only a tiny number - 24 - went to ports elsewhere. About 85% of Ireland's total EU freight trade goes via British ports - 475,925 containers last year. We can break that number down a bit further. The Irish Freight Transport Association estimates that the final destination of roughly 60% of the 475,925 freight containers shipped to Britain is Britain itself.That means the other 40% - roughly 190,000 per year - is destined for elsewhere in the EU, transiting across Britain via ports such as Dover or Hull, or via the Channel Tunnel. No-one knows the exact number, although Ireland's Department of Transport has commissioned in-depth research that should be released shortly. But one thing is clear: any kind of breakdown or problem posed by the failure to reach a Brexit agreement could have a huge impact, not just on Ireland's trade with the UK, but also on Ireland's trade with the rest of the EU. Don't forget that in this article we've just looked at Irish exports. Ireland is equally dependent on trade with the UK for its imports.Ireland currently sends lots of its exports to other countries via Britain because it is quicker than doing the whole journey by sea.Could Ireland try to cut out the so-called British land bridge and trade more directly with the rest of the EU? Some steps are already being taken in that direction.  One Luxembourg-based shipping company, CLdN, has just introduced two huge new Ro-Ro freight ferries on the direct sea route from Dublin to the Dutch port of Rotterdam, and to Zeebrugge in Belgium. The new ferries are the largest short-sea Ro-Ro vessels (ones that do not cross oceans) in the world, and can carry 650 cargo units on each voyage.When one of them, the MV Celine, was christened in Dublin in April, the chief executive of Dublin Port Company, Eamonn O'Reilly, said: ""The addition of new ships and sailings shows the shipping sector's resilience and ability to adapt to changing customer needs, particularly in response to Brexit.""""We expect MV Celine will mark the beginning of additional services to continental Europe from Dublin port over the coming years.""  Extra freight capacity is already being phased in on ferry routes between Dublin and Cherbourg, in France, as well as between Cork and Santander, in Spain.  But to give some idea of the extent to which Ireland relies on the British land bridge, statistics from the Port of Dublin show that last year it sent 31,875 loaded Ro-Ro containers to Belgium and Holland, while it sent 188,902 containers to Holyhead alone.So while some contingency plans are already being made, it's not nearly enough to replace the trade that currently goes to or through Britain. And that is a reminder that Ireland needs a good Brexit deal almost as much as the UK does. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-07-20,MPs criticise CPS criminal case failures,https://web.archive.org//web/20180721012202/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44892607,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs have criticised the director of public prosecutions over failings in the disclosure of evidence in criminal cases.A number of rape trials collapsed last year after it emerged vital evidence had not been given to defence lawyers. The Justice Select Committee said Alison Saunders did not recognise the severity of the issue and there was ""insufficient leadership"".Ms Saunders said addressing problems in the system was her ""top priority"". She is due to stand down from her post in October at the end of a five-year contract.In the lead-up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence or information that might either help the defence case, or harm the prosecution's case.But the Justice Committee's report said there have been ""persistent problems with the practice of disclosure"".""We have seen at least six reports in as many years that have highlighted issues and made recommendations,"" it said.The committee said that despite this insight, Ms Saunders failed to recognise the extent and seriousness of long-term disclosure failings.  Their report also said the Crown Prosecution Service may have underestimated the number of cases halted because of issues with disclosing evidence. Data from the CPS showed 841 cases in 2017/18 had to be stopped. But the committee said it knows that the true figure is higher - saying the CPS may have underestimated the number by 90%. Committee chairman, Conservative MP Bob Neill, said the police and CPS often see the disclosure of evidence as an ""administrative headache"" - a view which was ""not acceptable"". Mr Neill, a former barrister, added: ""Disclosure failings are extremely damaging for those concerned and can have a permanent life-long impact.""These failings have caused miscarriages of justice and - as the director of public prosecutions even admitted to us - some people have gone to prison as a result.""The committee found failings in the ""application of disclosure by police officers and prosecutors on the ground"" and called for a culture change, so it was seen as a ""core justice duty"", rather than an ""administrative add-on"".When it came to Ms Saunders, the committee said there was ""insufficient focus and leadership"" in dealing with the problem and that she ""did not sufficiently recognise the extent and seriousness"" of failures within the process.The report, published on Friday, also called on the government to look at whether there is sufficient funding for the system. Mr Neill said: ""The proliferation of electronic evidence makes disclosure ever more challenging, and we need the right skills, technology, resources and guidelines, to resolve this once and for all.""The failings are symptomatic of a system under immense strain: without change, we cannot expect the public to have confidence in the criminal justice system.""Responding to the report, Ms Saunders said: ""I have been very clear that addressing the long-standing problems in managing disclosure across the criminal justice system is my top priority.""There is an unprecedented focus on finding solutions, and extensive action has been under way over the past year to bring about the necessary change not just in how cases are handled, but in the wider culture within the CPS and policing.""This is not a quick fix. We will evaluate the measures taken, and agree further commitments to ensure there is continuous improvement.""The National Police Chiefs' Council's lead for criminal justice, Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave, defended Ms Saunders, saying she was ""fully aware of the extent and seriousness of the disclosure failures"" and ""fully committed"" to working with them. Another review into disclosure is being carried out by the attorney general and a National Disclosure Improvement Plan is being put into place.In January, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ordered a review of more than 3,600 cases in England and Wales after four cases were thrown out of court due to a lack of disclosure. The trial of Liam Allan was stopped in December at Croydon Crown Court, days before the prosecution of Isaac Itiary at Inner London Crown Court was halted.And in January, the case against Samson Makele was stopped at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London, while Oxford student Oliver Mears - who had spent two years on bail - had the case against him dropped days before his trial was set to start.The review found that 47 cases of rape and sexual assault had important evidence withheld from the defence."
2018-07-20,New MPs' code 'risks cover-up claims',https://web.archive.org//web/20180721012202/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44890194,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMoves to give anonymity to all MPs under investigation risk ""rolling back the openness"" established after the expenses scandal, a senior MP has said.Sir Kevin Barron warned: ""It will be presented as MPs trying to cover up their misdoings.""The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards has listed all MPs being investigated on her website since 2010. Under a new behaviour code to deal with harassment, ongoing inquiries would not be routinely published. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said it was ""not about rolling back transparency"" but that the standards commissioner's role had ""significantly changed"".Under the new code, the standards commissioner would now consider complaints that arose from the new independent complaints and grievance policy (ICGP), as well as allegations of financial misdemeanours and breaches of the existing code of conduct.  The motion put forward by Mrs Leadsom said investigations into complaints of harassment must be confidential, and ""for consistency and fairness, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards should no longer routinely publish information about individual investigations before those investigations are concluded"". ""To have one process for non-ICGP and a separate one for ICGP is simply confusing,"" said Mrs Leadsom.""This is a genuine attempt ... to put confidentiality at the heart, for the sake of the complainant.""Two government ministers - Damian Green and Michael Fallon - resigned over scandals last year, and a number of other politicians on both sides of the House were  investigated over claims of sexual misconduct.A survey of more than 1,300 parliamentary workers published in February found that 19% had experienced or witnessed sexual harassment or inappropriate behaviour in the previous year, with twice as many complaints from women than men.MPs voted through the new code on Thursday, and rejected an amendment by Sir Kevin and other members of the Commons Standards Committee to stop anonymity being applied to all investigations.Sir Kevin said the anonymity was the ""one issue"" on which his committee disagreed with the steering group lead by Mrs Leadsom.""We strongly support the work that has been done to bring Parliament into the modern age in terms of personal conduct,"" he said, adding: ""Not everyone in this institution has behaved in a morally decent way.""   He said they agreed that sexual harassment and bullying investigations should be confidential to give complainants confidence to come forward.But he added: ""We have considered carefully the (Commons) leader's argument for making this change and we understand why she has put them forward, but we do not think that they outweigh the reputational damage that may arise if we go ahead with this proposal as it is stated.""He told MPs: ""The rules were agreed by the House some years ago in the wake of the expenses scandal and were seen as an important way to demonstrate transparency and openness.""He read out a letter from members of his committee who are not MPs, which backed the current practice and said: ""Any proposals to limit this approach would be a detrimental step in continuing to build the credibility of the reputation of the House.""He also said previous efforts by the standards committee to expand the code of conduct to include ""some aspects of personal behaviour"" some years ago had been ""undermined... by what I may call, I suppose,  the forces of reaction.""Labour MP Jess Phillips voiced her concern about the change, telling MPs: ""I do worry about how it looks in trying to pull back on transparency"" and suggested it had been included as part of a deal ""done in order to get this through"". She said, while she had no proof, she believed it was ""a deal done by somebody in a whips office, somebody in a committee that controls one of our political parties"".Green Party MP Caroline Lucas added: ""I do share the sneaking suspicion that was voiced by (Ms Phillips) when she said perhaps there were other forces at play here which are leading us to this direction.""SNP MP Pete Wishart said the issue had been the ""most controversial, the most debated in the group"" and he felt ""conflicted"" about it, and it should be ""at the heart of the six-month review"" of the code.Mrs Leadsom said Westminster had been ""rocked by allegations of bullying and harassment since last November"" and the new behaviour code offered ""a new start"".""Today we can demonstrate our determination to put our House in order and to ensure that in the future everyone will be treated with dignity and respect."""
2018-07-20,New Brexit secretary to 'intensify' talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20180721012202/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44880968,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK's new Brexit secretary will hold his first talks with the EU's chief negotiator in Brussels later.Dominic Raab was appointed when David Davis resigned in protest at Theresa May's plans for post-Brexit trade.It now falls to Mr Raab - part of the winning Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum - to continue negotiations with the EU's Michel Barnier.Their meeting comes as the European Commission is instructing other EU states to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.The commission paper warns that failure to reach a deal would have a considerable impact on European business and citizens.Possible consequences, the paper says, include disruption to the aviation industry and goods from the UK being subject to custom checks.Speaking to MPs before setting off for Brussels, Mr Raab said he hoped Mr Barnier would ""fully support"" the proposals for post-Brexit trade with the EU in the government's White Paper.But he added the UK was stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit and would shortly be publishing advice for businesses on how to cope with it to minimise ""disruption"".Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said his government is also making contingency plans for ""the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit"".Mr Varadkar said that - even if there is a deal - Ireland will need 1,000 new customs officers and veterinary inspectors to deal with changes in trade rules with the UK.In the UK, the government has advised all its departments to have fully planned contingencies in place in the event of the UK withdrawing from the EU without an agreement.However the government watchdog, the National Audit Office, has warned that, in the case of one department, there is ""still much to do"".On Thursday, Theresa May will be making her first visit to the Irish border since the Brexit referendum. No 10 says the visit will ""reaffirm her commitment to a Brexit that avoids a hard border and protects the Belfast Agreement"".The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.But the two sides have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved. Mr Raab's trip to Brussels comes with debate raging within the Conservative Party about what Brexit should look like.By Katya Adler, the BBC's Europe EditorIt will be quite a baptism of fire for the new Brexit secretary. He will be greeted here in Brussels with a barrage of questions. First and foremost amid all the political turmoil in Westminster: What exactly is the UK's Brexit negotiating position now? The EU also has a strong message for Dominic Raab.Work with us, they will say, to finish the UK's exit deal - the so-called Withdrawal Agreement - otherwise the chances are rising of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal come March next year.On Wednesday, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who also quit over the proposals presented to the cabinet at Chequers - used his resignation speech to accuse Theresa May of ""dithering"" over the UK's strategy for leaving the EU.""It is not too late to save Brexit"", he said, calling for the government to ""change tack"".Former Remain supporters, on the other hand, were furious when the government changed its Customs Bill this week to comply with the demands of a Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs.The EU says it will analyse the Chequers proposals, which were set out in full in a White Paper, before coming up with a response.Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr Raab urged MPs to back Theresa May's plans.He said: ""What we now should all do on all sides of this chamber is not call for second referendums, not call for returning to the customs union, but get behind the government's plan, show some united front, so we get the very best deal for everyone in this country."""
2018-07-20,Windrush compensation 'could be capped',https://web.archive.org//web/20180721012202/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44888187,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowCompensation promised to the victims of the Windrush scandal could be capped under government proposals.Launching a 12-week consultation on a compensation scheme, the Home Office said a cap would ensure no-one got a ""disproportionately high payment"".But Labour said some victims had been left destitute and needed urgent help.Many migrants from Commonwealth countries were wrongly declared illegal immigrants, despite having been granted permission to settle in the UK. As a result some were threatened with deportation, the loss of their jobs, and others were denied benefits and healthcare on the NHS. Migrants from the Commonwealth Caribbean were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s.In May it was revealed that at least 63 members of the Windrush generation - named after the boat that brought the first Caribbean migrants to the UK - had been wrongfully removed since 2002.Under the proposed compensation scheme, fees from unsuccessful immigration applications could be compensated. The refusal of benefits payments, denial of healthcare on the NHS, and issues with social housing would also be considered under the proposed scheme. But in its current form these payments would be capped to ""ensure that no individual receives a disproportionately high payment from the public purse"".The government has also suggested a ""minimum size of claim"" to avoid high costs on processing ""low value claims"". ""We believe that both these measures would help to avoid any excessively high payments and protect the taxpayer from processing very low value claims,"" the proposal said.The compensation scheme will also take into account stress, anxiety and depression that was caused to individuals uncertain of whether they would be allowed to live in the UK. Eligibility for compensation would mirror the Windrush Scheme, which was set up by the Home Office to help migrants establish their lawful status. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Today marks an important milestone in our efforts to right the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation - who have made such a massive contribution to the UK.""He added he hoped it would ""help to right the wrongs suffered by those of the Windrush generation who have faced difficulties and suffered losses as a result of measures that are in place to tackle illegal immigration"".The consultation will run for 12 weeks and people and those affected are encouraged to give their views.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott criticised Mr Javid and said victims ""cannot wait until October for a consultation to be concluded on the government's promised compensation scheme"".She added that victims had been left ""destitute"" by the scandal, and accused the government of ""dragging its feet""."
2018-07-20,Parents may lose rights over sex ed at 15,https://web.archive.org//web/20180721012202/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-44886271,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government plans to let 15-year-olds overrule their parents' wishes and opt in to sex education lessons they have previously been withdrawn from.Education Secretary Damian Hinds says children should be able to request sex education in at least one of the three terms before their 16th birthday.Until then, parents will retain the right to withdraw their children.The plan was announced as part of new draft guidelines on the teaching of sex education in England's schools.These new, wider guidelines have been developed following concerns the existing guidance, last updated 18 years ago, does not cover topics such as:The guidelines, to become compulsory from 2020, are now open to consultation.In an oral statement to the Commons on Thursday, Mr Hinds said: ""We've previously committed to parents having a right to withdraw their children from the sex education part of RSE [relationships and sex education], but not from relationships education, in either primary or secondary school.""A right for parents to withdraw their child up to 18 years of age is no longer compatible with English case law nor with the European Convention on Human Rights.""It's also clear that allowing parents to withdraw their child up to age 16 would not allow the child to opt into sex education before the legal age of consent.""I therefore propose to give parents the right to request their child be withdrawn from sex education delivered as part of RSE.""And the draft guidance sets out that - unless their are exceptional circumstances - the parents' request should be granted until three terms before the pupil reaches 16.""At that point, if the child wishes to have sex education, the head teacher should ensure they receive it in one of those three terms.""This preserves the parental right, in most cases, but also balances it with the child's right to opt into sex education once they are competent to do so.""Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said she welcomed the move but suggested children should be allowed to opt in confidentially in such circumstances.""I welcome the statement that children have the right to decide that they want to receive sex and relationship education,"" she said.""All children should be empowered to make healthy, informed decisions, to know that it's not wrong to be LGBT and not acceptable to experience gendered harassment or violence.""But can he assure the House that pupils will be able to opt in confidentially if this is their choice?""Responding to her comments, Mr Hinds said: ""We're not expecting large numbers of cases where this is true.""The child would be able to access a term of sex education before reaching 16.""Mr Hinds also said health education would become a mandatory part of the curriculum for all primary and secondary schools from autumn 2020.Under the plans,  pupils will learn about mental health and developing skills such as confidence and resilience.  It comes amid growing concerns about mental health issues among young people.Classes will also cover physical health, such as the importance of exercise and healthy eating and the benefits of a healthy lifestyle as well as preventing health problems.Mr Hinds said: ""I want to make sure that our children are able to grow up to become happy and well rounded individuals who know how to deal with the challenges of the modern world. ""Part of this is making sure they are informed about how to keep themselves safe and healthy and have good relationships with others."""

On the stage with the prime minister were 45 celebrities, rounded up by the entrepreneur and Conservative fundraiser Sir Basil Feldman. They included some of the biggest names in TV at the time, including Ronnie Corbett, Jimmy Tarbuck, Bob Monkhouse and Shirley Bassey.Mrs Thatcher won, of course, and a few months later decided to give a party to thank her showbiz supporters. Forty-five guests would not fill up the grand reception rooms at Number 10 Downing Street, so the list, now revealed by the Thatcher Archive, was expanded. John Whittingdale, then Mrs Thatcher's political secretary, suggested Paul McCartney, Cliff Richard, Freddie Mercury and Mick Jagger as guests. The first two made the list, drawn up by the ministry for the arts: government ministers were added, as were civil list pensioners and sportsmen and women.This guest list, which contained 229 names, not including spouses, was copied by Mrs Thatcher's private office to Denis Thatcher, who was to co-host the party.He wrote back: ""Whilst I accept of course that not everyone who comes to our receptions are necessarily on our side I find it both unpleasant and embarrassing to entertain those who publicly insult the PM. ""This list therefore needs some careful checking in this regard.""He went through it with a red pen, ticking ""those who I would personally like to see included"" and putting a question mark by ""those who I believe do NOT help"". He added that more than one tick ""means super person and a known friend and wonderful to have them here"".Top of his list was the comic and actor Eric Sykes, who got four ticks by his name. The golfer Peter Alliss got three -  Ronnie Corbett got two ticks, as did Penelope Keith, Judith Chalmers, Tim Rice and others. More intriguing are his question marks. The artists Gilbert and George, described as ""image makers"", got two. Single question marks went to Jan Leeming, Paul Daniels and Shirley Bassey, who'd been at the Wembley rally, Paul McCartney and, oddest of all, David Attenborough.Richard Ingrams, who for many years wrote the Dear Bill letters in Private Eye magazine, purporting to be the private correspondence of Denis Thatcher to a golfing friend, has his own theory about the ticks and crosses.""One of the few things we know about Denis is that he had a very low opinion of the BBC. He thought that BBC people were all pinkos."" That might explain why Sir David got a question mark - or perhaps Denis mixed up his Attenboroughs. David's brother, the actor and director Richard, was a longstanding Labour supporter.""It's very unusual to have Denis interfering,"" Mr Ingrams adds.""Denis loved his wife and wanted to protect her, and kept out of the limelight himself. He used to say a whale only gets shot if it spouts.""Chris Collins, director of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation and editor of its vast archive website, agrees it was ""unusual"" for Denis Thatcher to involve himself to this extent. The reason, he adds, may be an earlier episode in which Mrs Thatcher considered suing BBC Radio 4's Today programme for libel over a satirical entry in a short-story competition, entitled Thatcherism: The Final Solution, which aired in January 1988.Mr Thatcher wrote a personal letter of complaint to the BBC's then chairman Marmaduke Hussey, saying that never had ""so foul a libel been published against anyone, let alone a prime minister"".Mr Collins adds that: ""The special coded system of question marks and ticks and crosses, that's actually slightly unusual.""Certainly the steam is coming out of his ears at various points in 1988 and this party he jumps on.""The final guest list included only the original 45 names, plus the 1988 British Winter Olympics team - and the parliamentary skiing team. Eddie ""the Eagle"" Edwards, whose efforts at that winter's Games had won him admirers around the world, wasn't there: he had a prior charity engagement.Richard Ingrams never met Denis Thatcher when he was writing Dear Bill, but he did later invite him to a lunch for the Oldie magazine, which Mr Ingrams founded and edited. After that, he came, as a paying punter, to literary lunches, always sending a handwritten ""thank you"" card.""And so that's quite funny, that for this party he comes down hard on people who've written unfavourably about The Boss [Margaret Thatcher], that he chose to fraternise with me! Albeit once her political career was over.""And did they ever talk about the Dear Bill letters? ""No, he never mentioned them. But maybe he thought that was just being polite.""Could Philip May ever play the same role? Richard Ingrams thinks not. ""He's playing the Denis role of keeping his trap shut. We know very little about Philip May. But Mrs May doesn't really measure up to Thatcher.""Members of the public will be able to browse through the archive from Monday 23 July by visiting www.margaretthatcher.org."

It includes advice on how countries, companies and individuals should prepare for the prospect of the UK leaving with ""no deal"" in place. BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris has read the document so you don't have to. Here are some key excerpts, and explanations of what they mean: From the outset, the EU makes one thing clear - even if negotiations go better than expected, it thinks there will be significant disruption, and everyone needs to be ready for it. (The EU talks about 30 March as exit day, by the way, because the precise time of withdrawal is due to be midnight on 30 March in Central European Time, but 23:00 on 29 March in GMT). The document emphasises that negotiations on a withdrawal agreement are continuing and that a negotiated settlement is the EU's preferred outcome.But it also notes that important issues remain unresolved - including on the protection of personal data sent to the UK while it was a member state and on the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in policing a withdrawal agreement. In particular, it states that there has been ""no progress"" in agreeing a ""backstop"" solution to avoid the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The EU notes, as it has done many times before, that time to both reach and ratify an agreement is running short. This is why preparations for ""no deal"" are so important. If there is a deal, there will also be a transition period running until 31 December 2020 during which EU rules and regulations will continue to apply in the UK. That will give businesses and governments more time to prepare for a new relationship. Without a deal, the transition (or ""implementation period"" as the UK government calls it) falls away and the relationship will change abruptly at the end of March next year. If both sides come to the conclusion several months before the end of March that there will be ""no deal"", they can at least make some contingency plans to deal with that. But if there is a last-minute hitch, time will have run out. So, from the EU's perspective, thinking about ""no deal"" means ""preparing for the worst and hoping for the best"". Much of the UK government would probably look at it in the same way - but there are many Brexiteers who think that ""no deal"" would be perfectly acceptable as long as sufficient preparations have been made.  This kind of language is scattered throughout the document. ""Don't say we didn't warn you,"" would be another way of putting it. The document stresses that some things will have to be done whatever the outcome. One thing it mentions is the need for companies to take steps to ensure that they have the right authorisations and certificates to access the EU market after Brexit. But contingency planning for ""no deal"" is the main emphasis - the EU says this is a prudent step because the outcome of negotiations ""cannot be predicted"". Among other issues, it notes that there would be no arrangement in place for EU citizens in the UK or UK citizens in the EU. It says controls at borders ""could cause significant delays, eg in road transport, and difficulties for ports"", where there could be ""long lines of vehicles waiting for customs procedures to be fulfilled"". It also says that the UK would become a third country for trade and regulatory issues, which would ""represent a significant drawback compared to the current level of market integration"". It also emphasises that while many measures would have to be taken at EU level, national, regional and local governments also need to step up their levels of preparation to ""mitigate the worst impacts of a potential cliff-edge scenario"" - cheerful stuff. And of course a lot of the attention is focused on making sure that individual EU businesses, big and small, are going to be ready for whatever emerges at the end of a highly unpredictable process of negotiation. The document notes that several EU governments, such as the Irish and the Dutch, have set up online platforms to help their companies prepare for different potential Brexit scenarios. The document also claims - in a sentence that won't please the UK government - that ""many companies are relocating to the EU27"" or expanding their operations there. EU officials insist that they are not trying to add fuel to the fire and that they are simply engaged in prudent planning. But it's a reminder that there are people in Europe, as well as in the UK, who see Brexit as an opportunity rather than a threat. The commission has now published 68 notices (anyone with a few hours to spare can read them here) on preparations in specific sectors of the economy, including health and food safety, financial services, customs, transport, and company law. They set out the legal and technical issues that governments and companies need to take into account and are another glimpse into the complexities of Brexit that stretch into every area of economic life.  In the UK, the government has not yet published any comparable information of its own.However, on Wednesday, Theresa May told MPs at the Liaison Committee that a similar number of technical notifications about what to do in the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit will be released during August and September - aimed at businesses and citizens.In response to the EU document, the Department for Exiting the European Union said ""It is the duty of any responsible government to prepare for every eventuality, including the unlikely scenario that we reach March 2019 without agreeing a deal. We have already done a lot of work behind the scenes to prepare for this - it is only natural that our European partners would seek to make similar preparations. We are keen to work closely with the EU on preparedness issues.""There are all sorts of EU databases, including many dealing with policing and internal security issues, to which the UK wants to retain access after Brexit. But the EU has argued that the UK can't simply pick and choose the bits of membership it likes - and this part of the document emphasises that work is well under way to remove the UK from numerous databases and IT systems once it becomes a ""third country"". The commission is also making preparations for changing international agreements that currently involve the UK as a member state. It says it will notify its international partners formally once it has sufficient certainty about the outcome of the current negotiations - not for a while, then. Finally, the EU document says work is under way to relocate or reassign tasks that are currently performed in the UK - such as the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre (part of the EU's project for satellites in space) or the UK-based EU Reference Laboratories - because it will not be possible ""to entrust a third country"" with such EU tasks after the withdrawal date.

2018-07-20,Profile: Ian Paisley,https://web.archive.org//web/20180721012202/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44885043,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIan Paisley's sanction for breaking parliamentary rules, which could see him suspended from the House of Commons for 30 days, is the latest chapter in a political career that has combined controversy with huge popularity at the ballot box.The youngest child of Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) founder Ian Paisley, Ian Paisley Jr entered elected politics in 1996 and took over as MP for his father's former North Antrim constituency in 2010.But controversy - whether surrounding his views on homosexuality or allegations of lobbying on a £50m government land deal - has never been far away.If he is suspended from the Commons for failing to declare the details of two family holidays in 2013 - paid for by the Sri Lankan government - it could deprive Theresa May's government of a crucial vote in crunch Brexit debates.Mr Paisley and his nine DUP colleagues in Westminster found themselves cast as kingmakers after the Conservative party fell short of a majority in the 2017 general election, which led to a confidence-and-supply deal between the two parties.The youngest of five children, Mr Paisley's interest in unionist politics was evident long before his election to the Northern Ireland Forum in 1996.After attending Shaftesbury House College and Methodist College Belfast, he studied modern history and Irish politics at Queen's University Belfast.During his time as a student, he made a very public demonstration against the dropping of God Save the Queen from graduation ceremonies.He and Peter Weir, now a DUP colleague, stood during the ceremony and played the British national anthem on a small tape recorder.ResignationIn 1998, he was elected to the new Northern Ireland Assembly, easing home on the second count behind his father, who topped the poll.In 2007, on the same day his father became first minister of Northern Ireland, he was appointed a junior minister in the devolved administration.But he served less than a year in the post before resigning, following criticism of his links to developer Seymour Sweeney, on whose behalf he allegedly lobbied over a £50m government land deal in his constituency.An ombudsman ruled there was no evidence to suggest he had broken assembly rules, but he stepped down, saying: ""The criticism has been a distraction and has got in the way of the activities of this government and importantly it has gotten in the way of the activities of my political party.""Mr Paisley's personal views have been the subject of criticism, particularly his opinions on homosexuality.In 2005 he was formally censured by the Northern Ireland Policing Board for describing homosexual relationships as ""immoral, offensive and obnoxious.""Two years later, he was accused by Sinn Féin of ""dangerous homophobia"" after being quoted in Ireland's Hot Press magazine as saying: ""I am pretty repulsed by gay and lesbianism. I think it is wrong.""In 2011, Mr Paisley said his views had changed: He told The House magazine that he had ""grown up"" since those comments.""I have huge respect for people no matter what their religious and social background,"" he said.""I think I have grown up since then. I have strong Christian beliefs and moral viewpoints, but you have to realise that while sin is black and white, life is a lot of grey.""He also faced criticism after saying police officers should ""shoot dissident republicans on sight"", later adding that officers ""should have the opportunity to employ lethal force against those who would seek to kill them.""But the controversies have done nothing to damage his popularity with voters in North Antrim. In 2010, he was elected as the MP for the constituency and has been re-elected twice since then. At the 2017 general election he cruised to victory with 59% of the vote.Following his censure over failing to declare details of his Sri Lankan holidays, many constituents told the BBC they remained supportive of the father-of-four, who has been married to paediatric nurse Fiona since 1990.Along with a passion for motorbikes, he lists his interests in Who's Who as his children, Chinese food, cinema and rugby.Despite being the son of the DUP's founder, Mr Paisley has not felt constrained to toe the party line on all occasions. When former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness retired in January 2017, Mr Paisley's tributes were notably warmer than many other unionist politicians.He told BBC NI's The View programme he wanted to thank former IRA commander Mr McGuinness, who struck a historic power-sharing deal with his father in 2007.His profile was raised after last year's DUP-Conservative deal, and he has been a strong supporter of Brexit, and US President Donald Trump.During the annual St Patrick's Day celebrations at the White House, Mr Paisley tweeted that he was the ""only person from NI to be invited to a private family reception"".He also invited Mr Trump to visit Northern Ireland and posted a selfie with First Lady Melania Trump on Twitter. Mr Paisley's interaction with another famous Twitter user saw him come under fire: He apologised after retweeting a comment by right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins, which read: ""March 2018. London has a higher murder rate than New York... and Ramadan's not yet begun.""He later deleted the comment and apologised, saying he had ""did not take cognisance of Ramadan reference"".That apology was followed on Thursday by an emotional statement in the House of Commons in which he admitted a ""deep personal embarrassment"" following the Sri Lankan holiday rule breach.He could now face a by-election for his seat in North Antrim, where his popularity with voters, undimmed until now, would be tested in different circumstances.

2018-07-20,What was the goal?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180721012202/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44871637,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt's the first Boris Johnson speech that I can remember watching that didn't have any jokes. For his allies, that was the point. It wasn't designed, they say, to make a personal attack on Theresa May. But my goodness, it made a pretty savage attack on her policies - a ""fog of self-doubt"", ""pretending to the electorate"", ""a fantastical Heath Robinson"" proposal on customs, ""miserable permanent limbo"".For someone who less than a fortnight ago celebrated collective cabinet responsibility at Chequers, that's quite some feat.But it makes me wonder exactly what was being said on the Chequers terrace when we captured Mr Johnson and Mrs May in what looked like vigorous conversation 10 days ago. What the speech today was designed to do, his supporters hope, was to present the former foreign secretary without the wisecracks, as a serious politician who is determined to argue for what he believes. His now small band of supporters circled him on the green benches as he spoke. He made the case for the Prime Minister's first big Brexit plan, her speech at Lancaster House back in January 2017 when she first outlined some of her aims and explicitly, completely and totally ruled out staying in the single market. For some Brexiteers Mr Johnson's words will be hugely welcome, a call to stop the rot as they would see it. One former minister told me plainly ""he was right - Lancaster House is a distant memory"", even comparing Mr Johnson's words to the closing scene of Gladiator when Russell Crowe playing the former all powerful Roman General Maximus, bloodied and staggering, said, ""there was a dream that was Rome that shall be realized"".The message, one man's dream can inspire a great many others to glory. Forget for a moment it didn't exactly end well for that particular Roman. But the question this afternoon is whether the speech can start the process of restoring Boris Johnson to his former political glory and more importantly of course, will it make a blind bit of difference to Brexit. On the first point, as Mr Johnson sat down along with some cheers, I heard another MP though call, ""is that it?"" His many critics will point to what was not in the speech, a new plan for Brexit. A government minister told me it was more of his ""deluded fantasy"" saying his ""simplistic notions"" about what could be achieved when we leave the EU won't compensate for what we could lose. Another MP told me ""it didn't really go anywhere, it had no substance"". The other crucial difference in pushing for the Lancaster House model is that it ignores the not inconsiderable fact that that speech and that set of proposals was developed before the general election, before Theresa May shot herself in the foot. Mr Johnson however will, after today's speech, be a well-known, prominent voice who has made it plain he will fight against the prime minister's current stance and any attempts to compromise further. With the turmoil in the Tory party, having him on the loose could, in time, make a difference. Not least, he is one of the few politicians in the country who is known, for good or for ill, by his first name. That is as much of a risk as an asset but it's real, and those who supported Brexit may well listen.For him, today was not about intentionally blasting into a leadership race, but trying to rebuild a new, for the want of a better word, brand of Boris Johnson. The clownish caricature that saw him through much of his time as Mayor of London and the referendum didn't wash as foreign secretary. After that, the number of MPs he excites as a potential leader is tiny these days. But today's speech was not an immediate call but a pitch to get him back in the long term game. It seems unlikely right now after the last couple of years. But one of his detractors grudgingly admitted ""he's never quite the busted flush"". "

But do they make a difference to getting on in politics?""I think that in this chamber a Brummie accent is a very rare thing. And I look forward to changing that!""So said Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, when she gave her maiden speech in the House of Commons in 2015.Accents are rich in sound but, as Ms Phillips emphasised, they are heavy in baggage that we load on to others and others load on to us.But do we all have an accent, wherever we come from?""We do. It is linguistically impossible to not have an accent,"" Rob Drummond, a linguist at Manchester Metropolitan University, says.""But the very fact that some people think they don't have an accent tells us something interesting about society. Because the people who think they don't, tend to be the people who have an accent from around the south-east of England.""This is still perceived as some kind of a standard way of speaking, but of course the only way it is perceived to be standard is because it is where the seat of power - between London and Oxford and Cambridge - traditionally has been.""There are MPs who have had problems being understood in the Commons. Alan Brown, the SNP MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun in Ayrshire is one. So too is Emma Lewell-Buck, who has been the Labour MP for South Shields on Tyneside since 2013.""Hansard would often ask for clarification. I type my speeches out in full now, to make Hansard's job easier, for clarity,"" Ms Lewell-Buck says, referring to the team that transcribes every word spoken in Parliament.""I think there are a hell of a lot more accents and regional voices in there, even in the time I've been in there,"" she adds. ""It makes it more a vibrant Parliament. It makes it sound like the country it represents a bit more.""But both Mr Brown and Ms Lewell-Buck have encountered the same thing back in their constituencies: surprise from locals that their MP sounds like they do. A welcome surprise, but a surprise nonetheless.It is a ""snobbery element in reverse"", reflects Mr Brown.I am fascinated by accents.Not just because I am intensely proud of my roots in the Yorkshire Dales, but because as a reporter, voice is more than just our vocal fingerprint. On the radio it is the whole professional ""us"".And believe me, you become very aware, very early on in a career in my game, that phonetic diversity matters. It is a badge of difference, for better or worse.I will never forget the observation from my year as a trainee in 2001 when I found out a kindly soul had predicted of my future: ""He won't get on the air with a voice like that."" As it happens, I rather suspect I have been incredibly fortunate in my timing - my career starting at just the point it was seen to be fashionable to have more regional accents in broadcasting. I also suspect there is probably a greater prejudice in our industry now against voices perceived to be posh.But is this hang-up about accents uniquely British? No, it turns out. Philippe Blanchet, a professor of linguistics at the University of Rennes, says French presidents ""speak with a neutral, standardised pronunciation, which is based on the one that comes from the higher classes in Paris"".""They are not supposed to have an accent. Because in France when people say you have an accent, it means that you don't use the standardised pronunciation,"" he says, adding: ""The least accepted accents in France are those of the northern part of the country and those from working-class urban and rural parts of the country.""A rather familiar observation...So, could a UK prime minister ever have a Brummie accent?I do not say this with a huge amount of conviction, but I think the answer is, probably, possibly, yes. If they were seen by their party and the country to be a worthy leader on every other metric of these things, maybe they could turn their accent to their advantage, claim it to be the very essence of modernity and a new politics.And yet, there is still evidence that prejudice could stand in their way. A poll by YouGov in 2014 put the Brummie accent at the bottom of a league table for ""the most attractive accents in the British Isles"".It is one of the reasons why I wrote ""probably, possibly"" a few sentences ago."
2018-07-20,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180721012202/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-20,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180721012202/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-07-21,Cabinet 'still being persuaded' over Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44913982,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA deal with the EU can be reached by October but the UK is preparing for the possibility of no deal, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said.He said he would return to Brussels for talks on Thursday and strain ""every sinew"" to get ""the best deal"".But the government had plans in place in case talks did not end well, he told the BBC.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there must be a ""serious stepping up of negotiations"" to avoid no deal.The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards.Theresa May hopes the government's plan, detailed recently in the Brexit White Paper, will allow the two sides to reach a deal on relations by the autumn.Downing Street said on Sunday that cabinet ministers would be promoting the plan across Europe over the summer.Theresa May would ""take the lead"" by meeting the Austrian chancellor Czech PM and Estonian PM next week.  Mrs May said: ""We must step up the pace of negotiations and get on to deliver a good deal that will bring greater prosperity and security to both British and European citizens. ""We both know the clock is ticking - let's get on with it.""Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if the ""energy, ambition and pragmatism"" the UK brought to negotiations was reciprocated, a deal would be done in October. He noted that 80% of the withdrawal agreement was already settled.And he said it was ""useful"" that EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had raised questions about the prime minister's blueprint for the UK's future trading relationship with the EU.""The fact Michel Barnier is not blowing it out of the water but asking questions is a good, positive sign - that's what we negotiate on.""  But he said preparations such as hiring extra border staff were being made because ""any responsible government"" would make sure plans were in place in case negotiations failed.Technical notices would be released for businesses and citizens affected during the summer to be ""very clear about what they should do and what we are doing on their behalf"" he added. Asked about European Commission comments that there were no arrangements in place for UK and EU expats in the event of no deal, Mr Raab said: ""Well, I think that's a rather irresponsible thing to be coming from the other side. ""We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here. ""There is obviously an attempt to try and ramp up the pressure.""Analysis by Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent We've heard it often enough: ""No deal is better than a bad deal"".But for EU negotiators to believe the UK would walk away without agreement, the government has to be seen to be taking that option seriously. And so we are told about ""planning"" and ""technical notices"" to prepare for a ""clean break"" Brexit. Reports of food stockpiles and a motorway becoming a lorry park are dismissed as ""unhelpful snippets"" but contingency plans will be made nonetheless.Both sides agree a deal needs to be reached by October, and negotiations are likely to go down to the wire. So even if a deal appears to be in sight, expect the talk of the UK leaving the EU without one to continue.He added that the prospect of people being removed from the UK was ""far-fetched and fanciful"" and said it would be ""frankly irrational"" for the EU to go for the ""worst case scenario"" of no deal. But the UK had to be prepared with things like allocating money, preparing treaty relations, and hiring extra border staff ""so that Britain can thrive, whatever happens,"" he said.Labour leader Mr Corbyn, on a visit to the annual Tolpuddle Martyrs Festival in Dorset, said it seemed the priority was preparation for no deal. He added that would be ""very bad"", as ""we then go onto World Trade Organization tariff rates that would hit the manufacturing industry and hit the food processing industry, and hit an awful lot of things in Britain very rapidly"". ""There has to be a serious stepping-up of negotiations to reach an agreement on customs and on trade.""Earlier, Mr Raab suggested to the Sunday Telegraph that he was still persuading other cabinet ministers that the government's ""pragmatic"" strategy for leaving the EU was the ""best plan"" and that the UK could refuse to pay its so-called divorce bill, a payment from the UK to the EU estimated to be about £39bn, if it does not get a trade deal. Theresa May's proposal for a future trade relationship with the EU sparked two cabinet resignations, including Mr Raab's predecessor David Davis.The White Paper proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but will end free movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations.Critics at Westminster say it is an unworkable compromise which would leave the UK being governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules.And EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier questioned on Friday whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical and said the EU would not run the risk of weakening its single market.Meanwhile, Mr Davis, whose resignation from Mrs May's top team was followed by that of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, told the Sunday Express the government should ""start again"" on withdrawal plans."

There's no justification for us to create additional burdens on business just because the UK wants to leave."" Mr Barnier questioned the UK's plans for a ""common rulebook"" for EU-UK trade as it only referred to goods checked at the border, not areas like pesticide use, adding: ""How can we protect consumers in Europe?""He also questioned whether the plans were workable without additional bureaucracy and said there were ""practical problems"" about how tariffs would be determined and collected - under the UK's plan, EU member states would collect tariffs on the UK's behalf and vice versa.But Mr Barnier suggested the EU's controversial ""backstop"" proposal aimed at avoiding a hard Irish border could be changed: ""There will be a deal if there is an agreement on the backstop. ""It's not necessarily our backstop. We can work on this, amend it, improve our backstop ... But we need an operational backstop now, in the Withdrawal Agreement, and not later.""Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg described Mr Barnier's speech as ""aggressive"" in a tweet:Today's aggressive comments by Messrs Varadkar and Barnier show why we are right to be leaving the mafia-like European Union.End of Twitter post  by @Jacob_Rees_MoggOn a visit to Belfast on Friday, Theresa May said the ""seamless border"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic was ""a foundation stone on which the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement rests"" and the concept of a hard border was now ""almost inconceivable"".But she reiterated her opposition to the EU's ""backstop"" proposal, that would see Northern Ireland effectively staying in the single market for goods and the customs union, as ""something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept"". And she dismissed suggestions made by former foreign secretary Boris Johnson that technology could be used to avoid the need for a hard border: ""No technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border.""She said the White Paper was a ""significant development"" of the UK's position and offered a ""coherent package"".""It is now for the EU to respond - not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind.""And, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions.""Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Ireland's RTE radio there had been a ""lukewarm"" response in Brussels to the UK White Paper.He added: ""We don't have any British proposal in terms of a functioning backstop in its entirety. We have bits and pieces of ideas."""
2018-07-21,Call for move to ban real fur sales,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44913186,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA ban on sales of real fur should be considered, a committee of MPs has recommended.The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee investigation into the issue came after some real fur was found wrongly labelled as fake.They described the current labelling of fur products as ""not fit for purpose"".The government said Brexit would allow the UK to ""go further"" when it came to introducing further restrictions on the fur trade.   Fur farming was banned in the UK in 2000, but it is legal to sell some types of real fur that have been imported, if it is accurately labelled.But the Efra committee said retailers and Trading Standards had been complacent about items being incorrectly labelled.Their inquiry came after it emerged High Street and online retailers including TK Maxx, BooHoo, Amazon and Tesco had recently sold real fur as fake. Other retailers found to have passed items off as faux fur included Not on the High Street, Groupon, Etsy, FatFace, Boots, Kurt Geiger and Romwe.  The Efra committee started its investigation in February, when cases of mislabelling came to light via reports from media and campaign groups.The MPs found that while many of the retailers concerned had no-fur policies, the so-called faux fur had actually come from animals including rabbit, fox and chinchilla.It said Brexit could be an opportunity to tighten regulations around the sale of fur and called for a consultation on a bar on the sale of all real fur. ""Many consumers have an ethical reason for not buying garments containing real fur,"" the committee's report said. ""The last few years have shown that there is vulnerability in retailers' supply chains and that real fur has been sold as fake fur. ""Our inquiry has highlighted that the current labelling system is confusing, not fit for purpose and with a high degree of non-compliance. It is also not being enforced."" The committee recognised that fur is ""a subject that raises strong feelings"", adding: ""In looking at whether to ban the sale and import of fur post-Brexit, the government will have to balance the needs of animal welfare against consumer choice.""  Committee chairman Neil Parish said: ""Reports of real fur being sold as fake fur shows that retailers are flouting their responsibility to consumers.""The mis-selling of real fur should not be discovered by campaign organisations and the media, but by Trading Standards officers and retailers.""Retailers of all sizes are complacent about the issue of fake faux fur. It is illegal to give misleading information and Trading Standards have been poor at identifying and acting against those who are doing so."" He recommended that the government should make sure local authorities had the proper resources, and Trading Standards adequate training, to help bring an end to the issue. ""Brexit provides an opportunity to step up our game when it comes to labelling,"" added Mr Parish, Conservative MP for Riverton and Honiton. ""The labelling of clothes must be consistent, transparent and customer-friendly, but current EU requirements are not good enough to allow consumers to understand the origin and contents of their clothing.""The British Fur Trade Association said it welcomed the committee's recommendations on addressing the problems of mis-selling fur and agreed the current European labelling was not fit for purpose.Chief executive Mike Moser said it was vital that consumers were able to make informed decisions, whether they were buying natural or fake fur.He wants to see a fur-specific label introduced on to the UK market which would give greater detail about the type of fur used.However, he said he was disappointed that the committee was recommending a possible trade ban,  despite acknowledging that the fur industry was a legitimate business and wearing fur was a matter of consumer choice.A government statement said: ""The government shares the British public's high regard for animal welfare, and fur farming was banned in the UK in 2000.""Trade in fur from domestic cats, dogs or commercial seal hunts are also banned, but while the UK is a member of the EU it is not possible to introduce additional restrictions on the fur trade.""Brexit gives us the opportunity to go further. Meanwhile, we will closely consider the committee's report and respond in due course.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said real fur sales should be banned.""I think fur products are unnecessary and there is often a great deal of cruelty involved in the production of fur pelts and the synthetic alternatives are much better,"" he said.

2018-07-21,EU must 'evolve' Brexit position - PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44892385,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe European Union must ""evolve"" its position on Brexit and not fall back on unworkable proposals regarding the Irish border, Theresa May has said.The prime minister made the remarks in Belfast on Friday, during a two-day visit to Northern Ireland.The issue of the Irish border has been the key sticking point in Brexit talks so far.The UK and EU have agreed that there should be no hard border in Ireland, but are at odds over how to achieve it.The backstop solution is effectively an insurance policy -  to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if appropriate customs arrangements cannot be agreed by the EU and UK in time for the end of the transition period in December 2020.The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system.However, the UK said that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea.On Friday, Mrs May again repeated her opposition to that, saying: ""The economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal 'third country' customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and believe no British prime minister could ever accept"".She also said both sides in the negotiation  ""share a determination never to see a hard border in Northern Ireland"".""And no technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet, or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border"".However, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has questioned Mrs May's plan for a future trade relationship with the EU, saying it could weaken the single market and create burdens for business.He said the UK's Brexit White Paper, published on 12 July, opened ""the way to a constructive discussion"" but must be ""workable"".Mr Barnier questioned whether plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical.Earlier this week, the government backed an amendment to its Customs Bill that would make it illegal for Northern Ireland to be outside the UK's customs territory. Mrs May said the EU's backstop proposal would be a breach of the Belfast Agreement - and that her plan, agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers earlier this month, was the best way forward.If UK Govt don’t support current EU wording on Backstop in draft Withdrawal Agreement, then obligation is on them to propose a viable and legally operable alternative wording that delivers same result: no border infrastructure. Clear UK commitments were made on this in Dec+March.End of Twitter post  by @simoncoveney""What I've said to the EU is that the legal text they've produced is not acceptable, that's why we proposed an alternative to that,"" she said.She said there now needed to be a renewed focus on EU-UK negotiations with ""increased pace and intensity"".The prime minister also met several of the political parties in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald said the visit was ""anything but reassuring"".""In fact it's now clear the British prime minister has come here to pick a fight with Ireland and to pick a fight with the EU,"" Mrs McDonald said.However, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, defended the prime minister.""What she has done is set out her agenda, that's very important. She talked about working together to find solutions, and the need to work collaboratively,"" she said.Theresa May wants a backstop that would see the whole of the UK staying in the customs union for a limited period of time after the transition period - something the EU has said is unacceptable.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme the government was committed to getting a legal text for a backstop.Earlier, the Irish Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney tweeted that if the UK did not accept the EU wording on a backstop in the draft withdrawal agreement, they would have to propose an  alternative that would deliver the same result. .@theresa_may arrived to protesters shouting “your rights, our rights” @BBCNewsNI @bbcnewsline pic.twitter.com/JJwBFGFs2LEnd of Twitter post  by @KellyBonnerReacting to his comments, Mrs Bradley said while the EU had put forward a legal text, ""we do not accept it"". ""We've put forward a counter proposal and we're now working on how we get a backstop that we are committed to delivering but it has to be a backstop that respects the integrity of the whole UK and does not put a border in the Irish sea.""The Shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd, told the BBC Labour had always been ""very clear"" that the UK should be part of the customs union. EU and UK negotiators have been meeting in Brussels this week to discuss the border issue.Friday's speech in Northern Ireland marks the prime minister's first major attempt to sell the Chequers agreement since it was reached by her cabinet earlier this month.She is due to tour other parts of the UK over the summer in an attempt to persuade businesses and citizens of its benefits.Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit.The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards.But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date of 29 March 2019 fast approaching.The Republic of Ireland will remain within the EU and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said his government is making contingency plans for ""the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit"".Mrs May also addressed the impasse at Stormont.Northern Ireland has been without a government for 18 months, after power-sharing between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin collapsed.She added that until devolution is restored, the government would fulfil its responsibilities but warned interventions from Westminster were ""no substitute"" in the long-term."
2018-07-21,Government admits rabies poster gaffe,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-44911209,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government has admitted ""mistakenly"" using a spoof poster that suggested parents should shoot children if they had rabies.The image appeared in a magazine for civil servants in a feature on the history of government communications.The poster was originally produced by the fictional Scarfolk Council, whose Twitter account parodies town life ""that did not progress beyond 1979"".The gaffe has gone viral on social media. Wow. This has made my week. This is from the government's *own* publication about the history of government communications. They mistakenly included a Scarfolk poster which encourages the killing of children. Clearly, nobody thought it was too extreme. (via @CraigHeap) pic.twitter.com/PITafePTKeEnd of Twitter post  by @ScarfolkA Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: ""This image is a parody of 1970s public information campaigns and was mistakenly used in a publication for illustrative purposes.""It was used in the printed version of the Civil Service Quarterly, along with government posters from the past 100 years, including the famous ""Careless talk costs lives"" campaign during World War Two.However, the rabies poster no longer appears in the online version of the magazine, where it has been replaced by the ""Lord Kitchener wants you"" recruitment poster from World War One.Scarfolk Council has developed a cult popularity online with its fictional depiction of a north-west England town, where ""the entire decade of the 1970s loops ad infinitum"" and ""children must not be seen or heard"".Richard Littler, who created the Scarfolk project, told Sky News he had ""no idea"" how the spoof poster ended up in the magazine. The writer, from Manchester, added: ""I'd like to think a Scarfolk fan and/or cult member infiltrated the civil service."""
2018-07-21,PM's whip excuse blatantly untrue - Labour,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44897844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour's deputy leader Tom Watson has accused Theresa May of making ""blatantly untrue excuses"" for the behaviour of her chief whip.Mr Watson said the PM's defence of Julian Smith was ""unbelievable"" and public trust in politics was at stake.Mr Smith is under fire after telling a Tory MP to take part in a key Brexit vote, despite an agreement not to with a Lib Dem MP on maternity leave.Pressed on Friday, the PM repeated her claim it was an ""honest mistake"".Pairing is an informal arrangement between two MPs of opposing parties that allows them, with the agreement of the whips (whips are the MPs responsible for discipline in each party), to miss occasional votes in the House - for example if they are ill, off on leave or out of the country.Mr Lewis, who was paired with the Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson, did not take part in most of Tuesday's Trade Bill votes, but did take part in the two closest divisions - one on customs, which the government won by just six votes, and another on medicine regulation, which it lost.Both he and Mr Smith have apologised to Ms Swinson, who gave birth to her second son Gabriel on 29 June and is on maternity leave, saying it was an ""honest mistake"".Asked whether she endorsed her chief whip's conduct, Mrs May said: ""There was an honest mistake made for which the chief whip and Brandon Lewis have both apologised to the member concerned.""By BBC political correspondent Chris MasonThere is an old saying in politics. When you are explaining, you are losing.The Conservatives have been doing a lot of explaining on this pairing row.Tory sources are drawing a distinction between ""long-term"" pairing arrangements, such as those covering maternity leave which are sacrosanct, and ""short-term"" arrangements which, they argue, are frequently breached by all sides.The twist is they broke the long-term pair with Jo Swinson ""by accident,"" and while they acknowledge Julian Smith did ""explore and possibly instruct"" shorter-term pairs to be broken, none actually were.Labour, to put it politely, say this is rubbish. ""This is about trust and honour,"" a source tells me. ""Julian Smith has tried to cheat, and should resign.""Some Conservatives too are pretty angry. ""Tacky,"" ""dishonest,"" ""appalling"" and ""concerning"" are among the words used by some.But a government struggling to get its business through the Commons can ill afford to lose the man whose very job it is ensure it wins those votes.But they have faced furious criticism - both from Labour and the Lib Dems, and some Tory MPs - amid suspicion Mr Smith deliberately ordered MPs to break their pairing deals because the votes were so important.Labour deputy leader Mr Watson said on Friday: ""It is unbelievable that the prime minister has repeated the desperate and blatantly untrue excuses made by her party chair and chief whip.""This is a serious issue that goes beyond efficient administration in the House of Commons. This is about public trust in politics. At such a crucial time for our country, people expect candour and decency, not cowardice and dishonesty.""He said if Mr Lewis and Mr Smith would not resign, Mrs May ""should find the strength to sack them"".""From forcing seriously ill MPs into the Commons in their wheelchairs, carrying sick buckets, to cheating a new mum out of her vote, this government is rotten to its core."" The Lib Dems have called on chief whip Mr Smith to explain himself after reports he told Mr Lewis and two other Tory MPs that they should go ahead and vote, despite being paired. Two of the MPs are reported to have refused to break their pairing arrangements.Conservative backbencher Philip Davies, who on Thursday became the third Conservative to declare publicly that he has submitted a letter of no confidence in Theresa May's leadership, told BBC Newsnight he had had his ""differences"" with the chief whip.But he said Mr Smith had ""always been completely honourable, decent, I have never questioned his integrity once"".""My understanding is that in this Parliament alone the pairings have been broken over 50 times .. and the overwhelming majority of those times, it was broken by opposition parties,"" he added.Referring to the absence of the Lib Dem leader and his predecessor from Tuesday's votes, Mr Davies said: ""I think this is a diversion tactic from the Lib Dems because Vince Cable and Tim Farron couldn't be bothered to turn up for a vote.""But other Conservative MPs, including Anna Soubry, Peter Bone and Heidi Allen, have also raised concerns. Mrs Allen said the chief whip had been ""unable to confirm to me that he did not give instructions to break pairs"" and she could ""only conclude MPs were told to break pairs on Tuesday"".""I refuse to be tarnished by this behaviour so will not stand by and say nothing. Integrity and honesty are fundamental to our democracy. Anything less is unacceptable."""
2018-07-21,Thousands of attacks on council staff,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-44114404,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowCouncil workers in Wales have been attacked almost 6,500 times in the last four years - with one stabbed and another hit by a car.Staff including refuse collectors, librarians, teachers and social workers were abused, with some getting death threats.The figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, were given to BBC Wales by all councils except Cardiff.Unions said better safety measures were needed to stop the ""appalling attacks"".Alison Hulmes, a social worker, told how a man threatened her when she was visiting his elderly mother, saying ""it's really easy to find out where you live"".She spoke of colleagues needing police protection after being traced on social media, and said she was scared the man who threatened her was going to follow her to her house where her young children were.""It was really frightening, I wondered if he was going to follow me... It was really clear that I wasn't going to drive home in case he followed me in his car to my house,"" she said.In the four years from April 2014, council employees were attacked at work 6,421 times, with at least 3,500 of these being physical assaults, according to figures.But the real numbers could be much higher as Cardiff council, the largest local authority in Wales, said it did not hold the data. It is also not clear how many incidents were referred to the police.A number of motorists used their cars as weapons in rows over parking fines, while one school worker was ""stabbed several times"" by a pupil in Bridgend, although it is not clear what with.While the majority of physical attacks were on those working in care homes, social services and education, a number of bin workers, planning officers, traffic wardens, librarians, museum staff and leisure centre workers were also assaulted, with staff being left with lacerations, bite marks, bruises and burns.In Bridgend, a traffic warden was beckoned to a car he had just issued a fine to, and then had a substance squirted in his face - which later turned out not to be toxic. Another was followed and beaten, while one was threatened by a man who said he had ""a knife"".One parking officer was hit by a car mirror when a motorist drove at him before getting out and attacking him. Another aimed his car at an attendant and drove at him ""at speed"", only stopping when he realised the warden was standing near a lamp post. One warden was told to ""kill himself"" and ""burn in hell"", while another was punched in the face after issuing a ticket to a man who had wrongly parked in a disabled bay.Hardback books, Jenga blocks, drawing pins, and even plaster casts were thrown at teachers and classroom assistants - others were punched in the face or bitten, and some were threatened by pupils with knives and scissors. Some of the worst threats were made against social workers, with one mother threatening to shoot her child's social worker in the head, while one father said he would ""stab them in the eyes"".A prisoner was also heard by guards threatening to kill a social worker, and one support worker was assaulted by a child, who pushed her into the road, causing her to hit her head on the kerb, before she was repeatedly kicked in the head. Recycling centre staff in Anglesey were verbally abused 15 times, with one staff member assaulted, while lollipop ladies were sworn at in front of children. When Alison Hulmes went to a remote house with a poor mobile signal to visit a mum with alcohol issues she did not expect to be abused.""It was clear immediately that mum was very intoxicated,"" said Mrs Hulme, a social worker in the Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend areas, with more than 18 years experience.""She'd been smashing things in the room, very quickly she came up to me and was shouting in my face, she was screaming and starting to make fist gestures and put her fists up to my face.""Mrs Hulmes, who is a representative of the British Association of Social Workers (BASW), said while staff always did risk assessments and had ""get out"" plans, being in the situation was ""extremely frightening"".She added that the hostility was getting worse due to austerity as people were desperate, while staff were stretched.""Social workers have not been able to drive home, people have found out where they live through social media, and have either tracked them or followed them, so they have been too afraid to go home at night, and have needed police protection,"" she said.The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said while serious incidents were rare it was ""deeply concerning"" that a small section of the public felt it was acceptable to abuse public servants.Councillor David Poole said: ""These people are teachers, social workers, refuse workers or park wardens. ""They are hard-working, caring, committed people, delivering vital everyday services to people in our communities. Councils provide support to their staff who are victims of abuse, which includes counselling, and warnings are issued to individuals, and more serious matters are referred directly to the police.""Margaret Thomas, assistant general secretary for Unison, said the figures were ""appalling"" and ""no-one should be in fear at work or return home injured"".""Assaults and intimidation are completely unacceptable. We are campaigning for the strongest safeguards for our members and all public service workers with zero tolerance towards perpetrators,"" she said.The Welsh Government said staff deserved to do their jobs without fear of violence or harassment."

The UK is hoping the EU will back the proposals so an exit deal can be struck by the autumn, ahead of the UK's official departure from the EU in March.But the proposals, including a ""common rule book"" between the two sides, angered many Tory MPs. Mrs Leadsom, who campaigned for a Leave vote in the 2016 EU referendum, told The House the prime minister was ""planning to engage quite strongly"" with Brexiteers over the next few days to ""help them to understand"" why the Irish border is a serious issue.She said it was incumbent on the government to ""make the case"" for the Chequers agreement - but that the EU must know that it was a final offer.""The EU has simply not taken us seriously so far in terms of the future agreement.""What this deal does is it says to them, 'right, now we can have a free trading area where there won't be the need for border checks and controls'.""It's saying to the EU, 'you better take this seriously'. In my view, it's take this seriously or we are heading for no deal. The message to the EU has to be, 'this is the final offer'.""Please upgrade your browserShe said the EU were not going to ""wriggle away at it and we're going to accept it. It is a very hard and fast offer to the EU that makes sense for them.""But if they don't accept it, we're also ramping up our no deal preparations. That's where we will be heading and they will have forced us to do that.""My message to the EU is, 'take this seriously because otherwise, you're forcing us down the road of no deal'.""Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit.The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards.But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date fast approaching."

""Their use is governed by a strict legal framework.""Throughout any deployment and beyond, the welfare of the young person is the paramount consideration."""
2018-07-21,UK government borrowing at 11-year low,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44898624,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowGovernment borrowing in the April-to-June period fell to its lowest level since 2007, official figures show.Borrowing for the financial year so far has reached £16.8bn, £5.4bn less than in the same period in 2017, the Office for National Statistics said.June's borrowing figure fell to £5.4bn, which was down from £6.2bn a year ago but was slightly larger than expected.Analysts said borrowing was falling faster than predictions had indicated, pointing to a less austere Budget.Public sector net debt, excluding public sector banks, was £1,792.3bn, equivalent to 85.2% of GDP.That is £33bn higher than a year earlier, but one percentage point lower as a percentage of GDP.""Borrowing is at the lowest level for over a decade, which shows our balanced approach is working,"" the Treasury said in a statement.Over the financial year to March 2019, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which produces the official government forecasts, expects the public sector to borrow £37.1bn.That amounts to about one-quarter of what it borrowed in 2009-10, at the peak of the financial crisis.However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said borrowing was falling faster than the OBR had expected, indicating that Chancellor Philip Hammond had room to change course in the Autumn Budget.He added: ""Borrowing still should come in comfortably below the OBR's forecast this year; we look for borrowing of about £33bn, equal to 1.6% of GDP.  ""Since the chancellor's target merely is to reduce cyclically-adjusted borrowing to below 2% of GDP by 2020-21, he has scope to scrap the remaining austerity measures planned for the next two years. ""Given that the Conservatives now lag Labour in the opinion polls and Brexit must be seen to be a success, we see no reason why the chancellor wouldn't opt to soften his plans in the Budget later this year.""The EY Item Club agreed, saying the chancellor ""may have more room for manoeuvre in November's Budget as he looks to find the extra funding needed for the increased spending promised for the NHS"". Mr Hammond has previously stated that tax rises will be needed for the extra NHS funding, as the government remains committed to bringing down the budget deficit."
2018-07-21,Reality Check: Brexit challenge for Irish trade,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44657460,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is proving to be a massive challenge in the Brexit negotiations, and talk of ""no deal"" is making a lot of people nervous. But it's not just in the UK that this matters, because the Republic of Ireland depends on trade with the United Kingdom for its economic well-being. There's been a lot of talk about north-south trade across the border with Northern Ireland, and the need to avoid any border checks. But in purely economic terms, east-west trade across the Irish Sea between Ireland and Great Britain is far more important.   The vast majority of freight traffic leaving the Republic of Ireland is exported from Dublin, with the busiest routes to ports such as Liverpool and Holyhead.How much trade are we talking about? One way of measuring it is to look at the data on roll-on roll-off freight containers, many of them carrying food and other retail items that people rely on every day. Roll-on, roll-off (or Ro-Ro) refers to containers transported on lorries or trailers, while lift-on, lift-off (or Lo-Lo) refers to containers that are loaded on to ships by cranes. (And yes, Rolos are still made of chocolate.) Ro-Ro transport is important for produce that needs to get to market quickly, or for just-in-time manufacturing processes that rely on hourly deliveries of components. Ireland's Central Statistics Office released figures on 29 June, which show that in 2017 553,630 loaded Ro-Ro freight containers, on lorries or trailers, were shipped from Ireland to the rest of the world. The vast majority were heading for other ports in the EU. Only a tiny number - 24 - went to ports elsewhere. About 85% of Ireland's total EU freight trade goes via British ports - 475,925 containers last year. We can break that number down a bit further. The Irish Freight Transport Association estimates that the final destination of roughly 60% of the 475,925 freight containers shipped to Britain is Britain itself.That means the other 40% - roughly 190,000 per year - is destined for elsewhere in the EU, transiting across Britain via ports such as Dover or Hull, or via the Channel Tunnel. No-one knows the exact number, although Ireland's Department of Transport has commissioned in-depth research that should be released shortly. But one thing is clear: any kind of breakdown or problem posed by the failure to reach a Brexit agreement could have a huge impact, not just on Ireland's trade with the UK, but also on Ireland's trade with the rest of the EU. Don't forget that in this article we've just looked at Irish exports. Ireland is equally dependent on trade with the UK for its imports.Ireland currently sends lots of its exports to other countries via Britain because it is quicker than doing the whole journey by sea.Could Ireland try to cut out the so-called British land bridge and trade more directly with the rest of the EU? Some steps are already being taken in that direction.  One Luxembourg-based shipping company, CLdN, has just introduced two huge new Ro-Ro freight ferries on the direct sea route from Dublin to the Dutch port of Rotterdam, and to Zeebrugge in Belgium. The new ferries are the largest short-sea Ro-Ro vessels (ones that do not cross oceans) in the world, and can carry 650 cargo units on each voyage.When one of them, the MV Celine, was christened in Dublin in April, the chief executive of Dublin Port Company, Eamonn O'Reilly, said: ""The addition of new ships and sailings shows the shipping sector's resilience and ability to adapt to changing customer needs, particularly in response to Brexit.""""We expect MV Celine will mark the beginning of additional services to continental Europe from Dublin port over the coming years.""  Extra freight capacity is already being phased in on ferry routes between Dublin and Cherbourg, in France, as well as between Cork and Santander, in Spain.  But to give some idea of the extent to which Ireland relies on the British land bridge, statistics from the Port of Dublin show that last year it sent 31,875 loaded Ro-Ro containers to Belgium and Holland, while it sent 188,902 containers to Holyhead alone.So while some contingency plans are already being made, it's not nearly enough to replace the trade that currently goes to or through Britain. And that is a reminder that Ireland needs a good Brexit deal almost as much as the UK does. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-07-21,MPs criticise CPS criminal case failures,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44892607,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs have criticised the director of public prosecutions over failings in the disclosure of evidence in criminal cases.A number of rape trials collapsed last year after it emerged vital evidence had not been given to defence lawyers. The Justice Select Committee said Alison Saunders did not recognise the severity of the issue and there was ""insufficient leadership"".Ms Saunders said addressing problems in the system was her ""top priority"". She is due to stand down from her post in October at the end of a five-year contract.In the lead-up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence or information that might either help the defence case, or harm the prosecution's case.But the Justice Committee's report said there have been ""persistent problems with the practice of disclosure"".""We have seen at least six reports in as many years that have highlighted issues and made recommendations,"" it said.The committee said that despite this insight, Ms Saunders failed to recognise the extent and seriousness of long-term disclosure failings.  Their report also said the Crown Prosecution Service may have underestimated the number of cases halted because of issues with disclosing evidence. Data from the CPS showed 841 cases in 2017/18 had to be stopped. But the committee said it knows that the true figure is higher - saying the CPS may have underestimated the number by 90%. Committee chairman, Conservative MP Bob Neill, said the police and CPS often see the disclosure of evidence as an ""administrative headache"" - a view which was ""not acceptable"". Mr Neill, a former barrister, added: ""Disclosure failings are extremely damaging for those concerned and can have a permanent life-long impact.""These failings have caused miscarriages of justice and - as the director of public prosecutions even admitted to us - some people have gone to prison as a result.""The committee found failings in the ""application of disclosure by police officers and prosecutors on the ground"" and called for a culture change, so it was seen as a ""core justice duty"", rather than an ""administrative add-on"".When it came to Ms Saunders, the committee said there was ""insufficient focus and leadership"" in dealing with the problem and that she ""did not sufficiently recognise the extent and seriousness"" of failures within the process.The report, published on Friday, also called on the government to look at whether there is sufficient funding for the system. Mr Neill said: ""The proliferation of electronic evidence makes disclosure ever more challenging, and we need the right skills, technology, resources and guidelines, to resolve this once and for all.""The failings are symptomatic of a system under immense strain: without change, we cannot expect the public to have confidence in the criminal justice system.""Responding to the report, Ms Saunders said: ""I have been very clear that addressing the long-standing problems in managing disclosure across the criminal justice system is my top priority.""There is an unprecedented focus on finding solutions, and extensive action has been under way over the past year to bring about the necessary change not just in how cases are handled, but in the wider culture within the CPS and policing.""This is not a quick fix. We will evaluate the measures taken, and agree further commitments to ensure there is continuous improvement.""The National Police Chiefs' Council's lead for criminal justice, Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave, defended Ms Saunders, saying she was ""fully aware of the extent and seriousness of the disclosure failures"" and ""fully committed"" to working with them. Another review into disclosure is being carried out by the attorney general and a National Disclosure Improvement Plan is being put into place.In January, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ordered a review of more than 3,600 cases in England and Wales after four cases were thrown out of court due to a lack of disclosure. The trial of Liam Allan was stopped in December at Croydon Crown Court, days before the prosecution of Isaac Itiary at Inner London Crown Court was halted.And in January, the case against Samson Makele was stopped at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London, while Oxford student Oliver Mears - who had spent two years on bail - had the case against him dropped days before his trial was set to start.The review found that 47 cases of rape and sexual assault had important evidence withheld from the defence."

On the stage with the prime minister were 45 celebrities, rounded up by the entrepreneur and Conservative fundraiser Sir Basil Feldman. They included some of the biggest names in TV at the time, including Ronnie Corbett, Jimmy Tarbuck, Bob Monkhouse and Shirley Bassey.Mrs Thatcher won, of course, and a few months later decided to give a party to thank her showbiz supporters. Forty-five guests would not fill up the grand reception rooms at Number 10 Downing Street, so the list, now revealed by the Thatcher Archive, was expanded. John Whittingdale, then Mrs Thatcher's political secretary, suggested Paul McCartney, Cliff Richard, Freddie Mercury and Mick Jagger as guests. The first two made the list, drawn up by the ministry for the arts: government ministers were added, as were civil list pensioners and sportsmen and women.This guest list, which contained 229 names, not including spouses, was copied by Mrs Thatcher's private office to Denis Thatcher, who was to co-host the party.He wrote back: ""Whilst I accept of course that not everyone who comes to our receptions are necessarily on our side I find it both unpleasant and embarrassing to entertain those who publicly insult the PM. ""This list therefore needs some careful checking in this regard.""He went through it with a red pen, ticking ""those who I would personally like to see included"" and putting a question mark by ""those who I believe do NOT help"". He added that more than one tick ""means super person and a known friend and wonderful to have them here"".Top of his list was the comic and actor Eric Sykes, who got four ticks by his name. The golfer Peter Alliss got three -  Ronnie Corbett got two ticks, as did Penelope Keith, Judith Chalmers, Tim Rice and others. More intriguing are his question marks. The artists Gilbert and George, described as ""image makers"", got two. Single question marks went to Jan Leeming, Paul Daniels and Shirley Bassey, who'd been at the Wembley rally, Paul McCartney and, oddest of all, David Attenborough.Richard Ingrams, who for many years wrote the Dear Bill letters in Private Eye magazine, purporting to be the private correspondence of Denis Thatcher to a golfing friend, has his own theory about the ticks and crosses.""One of the few things we know about Denis is that he had a very low opinion of the BBC. He thought that BBC people were all pinkos."" That might explain why Sir David got a question mark - or perhaps Denis mixed up his Attenboroughs. David's brother, the actor and director Richard, was a longstanding Labour supporter.""It's very unusual to have Denis interfering,"" Mr Ingrams adds.""Denis loved his wife and wanted to protect her, and kept out of the limelight himself. He used to say a whale only gets shot if it spouts.""Chris Collins, director of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation and editor of its vast archive website, agrees it was ""unusual"" for Denis Thatcher to involve himself to this extent. The reason, he adds, may be an earlier episode in which Mrs Thatcher considered suing BBC Radio 4's Today programme for libel over a satirical entry in a short-story competition, entitled Thatcherism: The Final Solution, which aired in January 1988.Mr Thatcher wrote a personal letter of complaint to the BBC's then chairman Marmaduke Hussey, saying that never had ""so foul a libel been published against anyone, let alone a prime minister"".Mr Collins adds that: ""The special coded system of question marks and ticks and crosses, that's actually slightly unusual.""Certainly the steam is coming out of his ears at various points in 1988 and this party he jumps on.""The final guest list included only the original 45 names, plus the 1988 British Winter Olympics team - and the parliamentary skiing team. Eddie ""the Eagle"" Edwards, whose efforts at that winter's Games had won him admirers around the world, wasn't there: he had a prior charity engagement.Richard Ingrams never met Denis Thatcher when he was writing Dear Bill, but he did later invite him to a lunch for the Oldie magazine, which Mr Ingrams founded and edited. After that, he came, as a paying punter, to literary lunches, always sending a handwritten ""thank you"" card.""And so that's quite funny, that for this party he comes down hard on people who've written unfavourably about The Boss [Margaret Thatcher], that he chose to fraternise with me! Albeit once her political career was over.""And did they ever talk about the Dear Bill letters? ""No, he never mentioned them. But maybe he thought that was just being polite.""Could Philip May ever play the same role? Richard Ingrams thinks not. ""He's playing the Denis role of keeping his trap shut. We know very little about Philip May. But Mrs May doesn't really measure up to Thatcher.""Members of the public will be able to browse through the archive from Monday 23 July by visiting www.margaretthatcher.org."

It includes advice on how countries, companies and individuals should prepare for the prospect of the UK leaving with ""no deal"" in place. BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris has read the document so you don't have to. Here are some key excerpts, and explanations of what they mean: From the outset, the EU makes one thing clear - even if negotiations go better than expected, it thinks there will be significant disruption, and everyone needs to be ready for it. (The EU talks about 30 March as exit day, by the way, because the precise time of withdrawal is due to be midnight on 30 March in Central European Time, but 23:00 on 29 March in GMT). The document emphasises that negotiations on a withdrawal agreement are continuing and that a negotiated settlement is the EU's preferred outcome.But it also notes that important issues remain unresolved - including on the protection of personal data sent to the UK while it was a member state and on the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in policing a withdrawal agreement. In particular, it states that there has been ""no progress"" in agreeing a ""backstop"" solution to avoid the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The EU notes, as it has done many times before, that time to both reach and ratify an agreement is running short. This is why preparations for ""no deal"" are so important. If there is a deal, there will also be a transition period running until 31 December 2020 during which EU rules and regulations will continue to apply in the UK. That will give businesses and governments more time to prepare for a new relationship. Without a deal, the transition (or ""implementation period"" as the UK government calls it) falls away and the relationship will change abruptly at the end of March next year. If both sides come to the conclusion several months before the end of March that there will be ""no deal"", they can at least make some contingency plans to deal with that. But if there is a last-minute hitch, time will have run out. So, from the EU's perspective, thinking about ""no deal"" means ""preparing for the worst and hoping for the best"". Much of the UK government would probably look at it in the same way - but there are many Brexiteers who think that ""no deal"" would be perfectly acceptable as long as sufficient preparations have been made.  This kind of language is scattered throughout the document. ""Don't say we didn't warn you,"" would be another way of putting it. The document stresses that some things will have to be done whatever the outcome. One thing it mentions is the need for companies to take steps to ensure that they have the right authorisations and certificates to access the EU market after Brexit. But contingency planning for ""no deal"" is the main emphasis - the EU says this is a prudent step because the outcome of negotiations ""cannot be predicted"". Among other issues, it notes that there would be no arrangement in place for EU citizens in the UK or UK citizens in the EU. It says controls at borders ""could cause significant delays, eg in road transport, and difficulties for ports"", where there could be ""long lines of vehicles waiting for customs procedures to be fulfilled"". It also says that the UK would become a third country for trade and regulatory issues, which would ""represent a significant drawback compared to the current level of market integration"". It also emphasises that while many measures would have to be taken at EU level, national, regional and local governments also need to step up their levels of preparation to ""mitigate the worst impacts of a potential cliff-edge scenario"" - cheerful stuff. And of course a lot of the attention is focused on making sure that individual EU businesses, big and small, are going to be ready for whatever emerges at the end of a highly unpredictable process of negotiation. The document notes that several EU governments, such as the Irish and the Dutch, have set up online platforms to help their companies prepare for different potential Brexit scenarios. The document also claims - in a sentence that won't please the UK government - that ""many companies are relocating to the EU27"" or expanding their operations there. EU officials insist that they are not trying to add fuel to the fire and that they are simply engaged in prudent planning. But it's a reminder that there are people in Europe, as well as in the UK, who see Brexit as an opportunity rather than a threat. The commission has now published 68 notices (anyone with a few hours to spare can read them here) on preparations in specific sectors of the economy, including health and food safety, financial services, customs, transport, and company law. They set out the legal and technical issues that governments and companies need to take into account and are another glimpse into the complexities of Brexit that stretch into every area of economic life.  In the UK, the government has not yet published any comparable information of its own.However, on Wednesday, Theresa May told MPs at the Liaison Committee that a similar number of technical notifications about what to do in the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit will be released during August and September - aimed at businesses and citizens.In response to the EU document, the Department for Exiting the European Union said ""It is the duty of any responsible government to prepare for every eventuality, including the unlikely scenario that we reach March 2019 without agreeing a deal. We have already done a lot of work behind the scenes to prepare for this - it is only natural that our European partners would seek to make similar preparations. We are keen to work closely with the EU on preparedness issues.""There are all sorts of EU databases, including many dealing with policing and internal security issues, to which the UK wants to retain access after Brexit. But the EU has argued that the UK can't simply pick and choose the bits of membership it likes - and this part of the document emphasises that work is well under way to remove the UK from numerous databases and IT systems once it becomes a ""third country"". The commission is also making preparations for changing international agreements that currently involve the UK as a member state. It says it will notify its international partners formally once it has sufficient certainty about the outcome of the current negotiations - not for a while, then. Finally, the EU document says work is under way to relocate or reassign tasks that are currently performed in the UK - such as the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre (part of the EU's project for satellites in space) or the UK-based EU Reference Laboratories - because it will not be possible ""to entrust a third country"" with such EU tasks after the withdrawal date.

2018-07-21,Profile: Ian Paisley,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44885043,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIan Paisley's sanction for breaking parliamentary rules, which could see him suspended from the House of Commons for 30 days, is the latest chapter in a political career that has combined controversy with huge popularity at the ballot box.The youngest child of Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) founder Ian Paisley, Ian Paisley Jr entered elected politics in 1996 and took over as MP for his father's former North Antrim constituency in 2010.But controversy - whether surrounding his views on homosexuality or allegations of lobbying on a £50m government land deal - has never been far away.If he is suspended from the Commons for failing to declare the details of two family holidays in 2013 - paid for by the Sri Lankan government - it could deprive Theresa May's government of a crucial vote in crunch Brexit debates.Mr Paisley and his nine DUP colleagues in Westminster found themselves cast as kingmakers after the Conservative party fell short of a majority in the 2017 general election, which led to a confidence-and-supply deal between the two parties.The youngest of five children, Mr Paisley's interest in unionist politics was evident long before his election to the Northern Ireland Forum in 1996.After attending Shaftesbury House College and Methodist College Belfast, he studied modern history and Irish politics at Queen's University Belfast.During his time as a student, he made a very public demonstration against the dropping of God Save the Queen from graduation ceremonies.He and Peter Weir, now a DUP colleague, stood during the ceremony and played the British national anthem on a small tape recorder.ResignationIn 1998, he was elected to the new Northern Ireland Assembly, easing home on the second count behind his father, who topped the poll.In 2007, on the same day his father became first minister of Northern Ireland, he was appointed a junior minister in the devolved administration.But he served less than a year in the post before resigning, following criticism of his links to developer Seymour Sweeney, on whose behalf he allegedly lobbied over a £50m government land deal in his constituency.An ombudsman ruled there was no evidence to suggest he had broken assembly rules, but he stepped down, saying: ""The criticism has been a distraction and has got in the way of the activities of this government and importantly it has gotten in the way of the activities of my political party.""Mr Paisley's personal views have been the subject of criticism, particularly his opinions on homosexuality.In 2005 he was formally censured by the Northern Ireland Policing Board for describing homosexual relationships as ""immoral, offensive and obnoxious.""Two years later, he was accused by Sinn Féin of ""dangerous homophobia"" after being quoted in Ireland's Hot Press magazine as saying: ""I am pretty repulsed by gay and lesbianism. I think it is wrong.""In 2011, Mr Paisley said his views had changed: He told The House magazine that he had ""grown up"" since those comments.""I have huge respect for people no matter what their religious and social background,"" he said.""I think I have grown up since then. I have strong Christian beliefs and moral viewpoints, but you have to realise that while sin is black and white, life is a lot of grey.""He also faced criticism after saying police officers should ""shoot dissident republicans on sight"", later adding that officers ""should have the opportunity to employ lethal force against those who would seek to kill them.""But the controversies have done nothing to damage his popularity with voters in North Antrim. In 2010, he was elected as the MP for the constituency and has been re-elected twice since then. At the 2017 general election he cruised to victory with 59% of the vote.Following his censure over failing to declare details of his Sri Lankan holidays, many constituents told the BBC they remained supportive of the father-of-four, who has been married to paediatric nurse Fiona since 1990.Along with a passion for motorbikes, he lists his interests in Who's Who as his children, Chinese food, cinema and rugby.Despite being the son of the DUP's founder, Mr Paisley has not felt constrained to toe the party line on all occasions. When former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness retired in January 2017, Mr Paisley's tributes were notably warmer than many other unionist politicians.He told BBC NI's The View programme he wanted to thank former IRA commander Mr McGuinness, who struck a historic power-sharing deal with his father in 2007.His profile was raised after last year's DUP-Conservative deal, and he has been a strong supporter of Brexit, and US President Donald Trump.During the annual St Patrick's Day celebrations at the White House, Mr Paisley tweeted that he was the ""only person from NI to be invited to a private family reception"".He also invited Mr Trump to visit Northern Ireland and posted a selfie with First Lady Melania Trump on Twitter. Mr Paisley's interaction with another famous Twitter user saw him come under fire: He apologised after retweeting a comment by right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins, which read: ""March 2018. London has a higher murder rate than New York... and Ramadan's not yet begun.""He later deleted the comment and apologised, saying he had ""did not take cognisance of Ramadan reference"".That apology was followed on Thursday by an emotional statement in the House of Commons in which he admitted a ""deep personal embarrassment"" following the Sri Lankan holiday rule breach.He could now face a by-election for his seat in North Antrim, where his popularity with voters, undimmed until now, would be tested in different circumstances.

2018-07-21,What was the goal?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44871637,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt's the first Boris Johnson speech that I can remember watching that didn't have any jokes. For his allies, that was the point. It wasn't designed, they say, to make a personal attack on Theresa May. But my goodness, it made a pretty savage attack on her policies - a ""fog of self-doubt"", ""pretending to the electorate"", ""a fantastical Heath Robinson"" proposal on customs, ""miserable permanent limbo"".For someone who less than a fortnight ago celebrated collective cabinet responsibility at Chequers, that's quite some feat.But it makes me wonder exactly what was being said on the Chequers terrace when we captured Mr Johnson and Mrs May in what looked like vigorous conversation 10 days ago. What the speech today was designed to do, his supporters hope, was to present the former foreign secretary without the wisecracks, as a serious politician who is determined to argue for what he believes. His now small band of supporters circled him on the green benches as he spoke. He made the case for the Prime Minister's first big Brexit plan, her speech at Lancaster House back in January 2017 when she first outlined some of her aims and explicitly, completely and totally ruled out staying in the single market. For some Brexiteers Mr Johnson's words will be hugely welcome, a call to stop the rot as they would see it. One former minister told me plainly ""he was right - Lancaster House is a distant memory"", even comparing Mr Johnson's words to the closing scene of Gladiator when Russell Crowe playing the former all powerful Roman General Maximus, bloodied and staggering, said, ""there was a dream that was Rome that shall be realized"".The message, one man's dream can inspire a great many others to glory. Forget for a moment it didn't exactly end well for that particular Roman. But the question this afternoon is whether the speech can start the process of restoring Boris Johnson to his former political glory and more importantly of course, will it make a blind bit of difference to Brexit. On the first point, as Mr Johnson sat down along with some cheers, I heard another MP though call, ""is that it?"" His many critics will point to what was not in the speech, a new plan for Brexit. A government minister told me it was more of his ""deluded fantasy"" saying his ""simplistic notions"" about what could be achieved when we leave the EU won't compensate for what we could lose. Another MP told me ""it didn't really go anywhere, it had no substance"". The other crucial difference in pushing for the Lancaster House model is that it ignores the not inconsiderable fact that that speech and that set of proposals was developed before the general election, before Theresa May shot herself in the foot. Mr Johnson however will, after today's speech, be a well-known, prominent voice who has made it plain he will fight against the prime minister's current stance and any attempts to compromise further. With the turmoil in the Tory party, having him on the loose could, in time, make a difference. Not least, he is one of the few politicians in the country who is known, for good or for ill, by his first name. That is as much of a risk as an asset but it's real, and those who supported Brexit may well listen.For him, today was not about intentionally blasting into a leadership race, but trying to rebuild a new, for the want of a better word, brand of Boris Johnson. The clownish caricature that saw him through much of his time as Mayor of London and the referendum didn't wash as foreign secretary. After that, the number of MPs he excites as a potential leader is tiny these days. But today's speech was not an immediate call but a pitch to get him back in the long term game. It seems unlikely right now after the last couple of years. But one of his detractors grudgingly admitted ""he's never quite the busted flush"". "
2018-07-21,Voice of Britain,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44845342,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAccents show a lot about a person's life and background. But do they make a difference to getting on in politics?""I think that in this chamber a Brummie accent is a very rare thing. And I look forward to changing that!""So said Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, when she gave her maiden speech in the House of Commons in 2015.Accents are rich in sound but, as Ms Phillips emphasised, they are heavy in baggage that we load on to others and others load on to us.But do we all have an accent, wherever we come from?""We do. It is linguistically impossible to not have an accent,"" Rob Drummond, a linguist at Manchester Metropolitan University, says.""But the very fact that some people think they don't have an accent tells us something interesting about society. Because the people who think they don't, tend to be the people who have an accent from around the south-east of England.""This is still perceived as some kind of a standard way of speaking, but of course the only way it is perceived to be standard is because it is where the seat of power - between London and Oxford and Cambridge - traditionally has been.""There are MPs who have had problems being understood in the Commons. Alan Brown, the SNP MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun in Ayrshire is one. So too is Emma Lewell-Buck, who has been the Labour MP for South Shields on Tyneside since 2013.""Hansard would often ask for clarification. I type my speeches out in full now, to make Hansard's job easier, for clarity,"" Ms Lewell-Buck says, referring to the team that transcribes every word spoken in Parliament.""I think there are a hell of a lot more accents and regional voices in there, even in the time I've been in there,"" she adds. ""It makes it more a vibrant Parliament. It makes it sound like the country it represents a bit more.""But both Mr Brown and Ms Lewell-Buck have encountered the same thing back in their constituencies: surprise from locals that their MP sounds like they do. A welcome surprise, but a surprise nonetheless.It is a ""snobbery element in reverse"", reflects Mr Brown.I am fascinated by accents.Not just because I am intensely proud of my roots in the Yorkshire Dales, but because as a reporter, voice is more than just our vocal fingerprint. On the radio it is the whole professional ""us"".And believe me, you become very aware, very early on in a career in my game, that phonetic diversity matters. It is a badge of difference, for better or worse.I will never forget the observation from my year as a trainee in 2001 when I found out a kindly soul had predicted of my future: ""He won't get on the air with a voice like that."" As it happens, I rather suspect I have been incredibly fortunate in my timing - my career starting at just the point it was seen to be fashionable to have more regional accents in broadcasting. I also suspect there is probably a greater prejudice in our industry now against voices perceived to be posh.But is this hang-up about accents uniquely British? No, it turns out. Philippe Blanchet, a professor of linguistics at the University of Rennes, says French presidents ""speak with a neutral, standardised pronunciation, which is based on the one that comes from the higher classes in Paris"".""They are not supposed to have an accent. Because in France when people say you have an accent, it means that you don't use the standardised pronunciation,"" he says, adding: ""The least accepted accents in France are those of the northern part of the country and those from working-class urban and rural parts of the country.""A rather familiar observation...So, could a UK prime minister ever have a Brummie accent?I do not say this with a huge amount of conviction, but I think the answer is, probably, possibly, yes. If they were seen by their party and the country to be a worthy leader on every other metric of these things, maybe they could turn their accent to their advantage, claim it to be the very essence of modernity and a new politics.And yet, there is still evidence that prejudice could stand in their way. A poll by YouGov in 2014 put the Brummie accent at the bottom of a league table for ""the most attractive accents in the British Isles"".It is one of the reasons why I wrote ""probably, possibly"" a few sentences ago."
2018-07-21,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-21,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180722012014/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

The EU and the UK want a deal in place by October.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said a deal could be done if both showed ""energy, ambition and pragmatism"".But he also said preparations were under way in case negotiations failed and the UK left the European Union with no deal in place.The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work afterwards.Theresa May hopes the government's plan, detailed in the Brexit White Paper, will allow the two sides to reach a deal on relations by the autumn. She said: ""The White Paper sets out in detail our proposal for an unprecedented economic and security partnership - it is the right approach both for the UK and the EU.""""This is a principled and practical Brexit that is in the mutual interests of the UK and EU but it will require pragmatism from both sides.  ""We must step up the pace of negotiations and get on to deliver a good deal that will bring greater prosperity and security to both British and European citizens. We both know the clock is ticking - let's get on with it.""The White Paper proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but will end free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations.Mrs May is meeting her senior ministers in Gateshead on Monday morning for the last scheduled cabinet meeting until September. After Parliament rises for the summer recess on Tuesday, Downing Street said the UK negotiating team would be travelling to Brussels while the foreign secretary, chancellor, home secretary, business secretary and the minister for the Cabinet Office will meet counterparts across Europe.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will meet his German counterpart Heiko Maas later today, when he will tell him the EU must show ""more flexibility and creativity"" to avoid what he will call a ""no deal by accident scenario"".Critics at Westminster say the White Paper is an unworkable compromise, which would leave the UK governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules.The plan sparked two cabinet resignations - then Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier questioned on Friday whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical and said the EU would not run the risk of weakening its single market.He questioned whether the plans could work without causing extra bureaucracy and said there were ""practical problems"" about how tariffs would be determined and collected.Dominic Raab has said a deal could be done by October, but making 'no deal' preparations such as hiring extra border staff was part of being a ""responsible government"".The Times has reported that the head of Amazon in the UK, Doug Gurr, warned of potential ""civil unrest"" in the event of 'no deal' at a meeting with Mr Raab on Friday. Labour leader Mr Corbyn said it seemed the government's priority was preparing for no deal, which would be bad for industry. ""There has to be a serious stepping-up of negotiations to reach an agreement on customs and on trade,"" he said."
2018-07-22,Labour to 'get it right' on anti-Semitism,https://web.archive.org//web/20180723021306/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44915925,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour will get its new code of conduct on anti-Semitism ""right"" and restore faith among the Jewish community, a shadow cabinet minister has said.Rebecca Long-Bailey said the party had been in a ""very dark place"" because of ""the actions of a minority... and the failure of us to deal with it quickly"".Labour's new guidelines were criticised by some Jewish leaders and some MPs.One MP, Margaret Hodge faces ""action"" after reportedly swearing at Jeremy Corbyn over the issue last week.Labour's code of conduct was rubber-stamped by its executive committee on Tuesday.It says: ""Anti-Semitism is racism. It is unacceptable in our party and in wider society.""But it does not include all of the ""working examples"" given in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism.Following criticism, Labour said it would ""reopen development of the code"" in consultation with Jewish groups.Ms Long-Bailey said the code had been intended to reaffirm Labour's commitment to the the IHRA definition and ""adopt and expand"" upon the examples.She told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""We wanted to develop a code that was legally robust and detailed so that we could enforce it quickly in our disciplinary processes.""But we haven't won the faith of the Jewish community, and indeed my own parliamentary colleagues have expressed concern.""The intention was never to omit parts of the IHRA definition.""She added: ""We recognise the concerns and that's why this week it was right for the NEC to look at the code again and look at consulting with the Jewish community to make sure we get it right, because we have to restore faith in the Jewish community.""Senior Jewish Labour MP Dame Margaret, who lost family members in the Holocaust, last week confronted Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in Parliament over the party's response to anti-Semitism.She later said Mr Corbyn was ""now perceived by many as an anti-Semite"" and faces action under Parliamentary Labour Party procedures requiring MPs to behave in a ""respectful"" way towards colleagues.Ms Hodge has said she chose to ""confront"" Mr Corbyn to express her ""outrage"".Mr Corbyn said on Sunday he had ""felt upset about it but as always I am very calm and treat people with a great deal of respect"".He said there would be further consultation on the code before Labour ""bring it back and get it right"".""I want us to deal with anti-Semitism in our society, as well as all of our parties, including my own.He added: ""What's been done is an honest attempt to make sure that we do make it clear we will not tolerate anti-Semitism in any form and we will allow legitimate debate on issues facing Israel and Palestine, but it cannot ever be conducted in any anti-Semitic form.""Labour's code of conduct was drawn up after the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry. It followed allegations of anti-Semitism within party ranks.The code does reproduce the IHRA's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and lists behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples from that definition:Labour's code says it is ""wrong"" to accuse Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than their own country.And it says that using Nazi comparisons in Israel-Palestine debates ""carries a strong risk of being regarded as prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party"", triggering a disciplinary investigation. Labour backbencher Stella Creasy, told BBC One's Sunday Politics that ""many of us are absolutely despairing"" that Labour had not yet resolved the anti-Semitism row.""I don't think Jeremy Corbyn is an anti-Semite at all but I do think what's happening now requires his leadership,"" she said.""It's really important that we tackle this, that we end this and the way we end this is by adopting those IHRA guidelines."""
2018-07-22,Brexit deal can be done by October - Raab,https://web.archive.org//web/20180723021306/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44913982,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA deal with the EU can be reached by October but the UK is preparing for the possibility of no deal, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said.He said he would return to Brussels for talks on Thursday and strain ""every sinew"" to get ""the best deal"".But the government had plans in place in case talks did not end well, he told the BBC.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there must be a ""serious stepping up of negotiations"" to avoid no deal.The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards.Theresa May hopes the government's plan, detailed recently in the Brexit White Paper, will allow the two sides to reach a deal on relations by the autumn.Downing Street said on Sunday that cabinet ministers would be promoting the plan across Europe over the summer.Theresa May would ""take the lead"" by meeting the Austrian chancellor Czech PM and Estonian PM next week.  Mrs May said: ""We must step up the pace of negotiations and get on to deliver a good deal that will bring greater prosperity and security to both British and European citizens. ""We both know the clock is ticking - let's get on with it.""Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if the ""energy, ambition and pragmatism"" the UK brought to negotiations was reciprocated, a deal would be done in October. He noted that 80% of the withdrawal agreement was already settled.And he said it was ""useful"" that EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had raised questions about the prime minister's blueprint for the UK's future trading relationship with the EU.""The fact Michel Barnier is not blowing it out of the water but asking questions is a good, positive sign - that's what we negotiate on.""  But he said preparations such as hiring extra border staff were being made because ""any responsible government"" would make sure plans were in place in case negotiations failed.Technical notices would be released for businesses and citizens affected during the summer to be ""very clear about what they should do and what we are doing on their behalf"" he added. Asked about European Commission comments that there were no arrangements in place for UK and EU expats in the event of no deal, Mr Raab said: ""Well, I think that's a rather irresponsible thing to be coming from the other side. ""We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here. ""There is obviously an attempt to try and ramp up the pressure.""Analysis by Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent We've heard it often enough: ""No deal is better than a bad deal"".But for EU negotiators to believe the UK would walk away without agreement, the government has to be seen to be taking that option seriously. And so we are told about ""planning"" and ""technical notices"" to prepare for a ""clean break"" Brexit. Reports of food stockpiles and a motorway becoming a lorry park are dismissed as ""unhelpful snippets"" but contingency plans will be made nonetheless.Both sides agree a deal needs to be reached by October, and negotiations are likely to go down to the wire. So even if a deal appears to be in sight, expect the talk of the UK leaving the EU without one to continue.He added that the prospect of people being removed from the UK was ""far-fetched and fanciful"" and said it would be ""frankly irrational"" for the EU to go for the ""worst case scenario"" of no deal. But the UK had to be prepared with things like allocating money, preparing treaty relations, and hiring extra border staff ""so that Britain can thrive, whatever happens,"" he said.Labour leader Mr Corbyn, on a visit to the annual Tolpuddle Martyrs Festival in Dorset, said it seemed the priority was preparation for no deal. He added that would be ""very bad"", as ""we then go onto World Trade Organization tariff rates that would hit the manufacturing industry and hit the food processing industry, and hit an awful lot of things in Britain very rapidly"". ""There has to be a serious stepping-up of negotiations to reach an agreement on customs and on trade.""Earlier, Mr Raab suggested to the Sunday Telegraph that he was still persuading other cabinet ministers that the government's ""pragmatic"" strategy for leaving the EU was the ""best plan"" and that the UK could refuse to pay its so-called divorce bill, a payment from the UK to the EU estimated to be about £39bn, if it does not get a trade deal. Theresa May's proposal for a future trade relationship with the EU sparked two cabinet resignations, including Mr Raab's predecessor David Davis.The White Paper proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but will end free movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations.Critics at Westminster say it is an unworkable compromise which would leave the UK being governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules.And EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier questioned on Friday whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical and said the EU would not run the risk of weakening its single market.Meanwhile, Mr Davis, whose resignation from Mrs May's top team was followed by that of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, told the Sunday Express the government should ""start again"" on withdrawal plans."

""I was having a confidential private discussion.""He added: ""I do talk to people in other parties."" The Sunday Times reported that Sir Vince missed the vote because he was attending a dinner to discuss the prospects for a new anti-Brexit party.The Lib Dems have been calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.Sir Vince told BBC 5live's Pienaar's Politics: ""The immediate preoccupation is to work with people in other parties to stop Brexit, but in the longer term there may well be realignment because of the deep splits in the parties and I want my party to be at the centre of it.""But he said he would ""absolutely not"" be joining a new party, adding: ""I have got a very good party of my own.""Of the Customs Bill vote on Monday night, he said: ""It was a close vote, it wasn't in itself a big vote but that is not important. We did make a mistake, I made a mistake and won't do that again.""""Party leaders, and indeed many others, spend a lot of time in confidential private conversations and that is what was involved and we got the timing wrong on this occasion.""Mr Farron has also said he had ""called it wrong"". He was booked to give a talk, Illiberal Truths, about the furore during the last general election over whether or not he believed gay sex was a sin.Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael said he had ""messed up"" by allowing both men to skip the vote he had expected to be ""lost by hundreds"".All the party's other MPs - with the exception of Jo Swinson, who is on maternity leave - cast their ballot against the government on amendments to legislation defining the UK's customs arrangements with the EU after it leaves in March 2019.The amendments, tabled by Eurosceptic Tory MPs, were accepted by ministers - prompting a backlash by pro-European Tories, 14 of whom ended up voting against the government.With Labour also voting against, the government scraped home in two votes by a margin of three.Sir Vince said his own absence had been ""overshadowed"" by ""the large scale cheating on pairing arrangements"" - a reference to the row over the Tory chief whip's behaviour in another crunch vote the previous night, on the Trade Bill. Julian Smith is under fire for telling a Tory MP, who was ""paired"" with Ms Swinson, to take part in the vote - something he has said was done ""in error""."

A United Nations Committee has also said women's rights are being breached.The cross-party letter to Prime Minister Theresa May and her Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar was coordinated by Ms Creasy and signed by 173 parliamentarians from across the UK and Ireland. They include Labour's Harriet Harman and Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, as well as Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald and the party's vice-president Michelle O'Neill.It said the Good Friday Agreement was signed on the understanding that laws would be compliant and called for an ""explicit legislative timetable"" to be set out to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland.It reads: ""This is a critical step towards ending the treatment of women in Northern Ireland as second-class citizens.""Downing Street has so far said that the issue should be dealt with by the Northern Ireland Assembly, once devolution is restored.The Democratic Unionist Party says it is ""pro-life"" and has campaigned against any extension of abortion rights in Northern Ireland.The DUP's Sammy Wilson said abortion law was a decision for the people in Northern Ireland.However, there has not been an executive at Stormont since the governing parties - the DUP and Sinn Fein - split over a bitter row 18 months ago. This means there are no ministers in place to approve any major decisions.But Mr Wilson said: ""This idea that somehow laws which don't reflect the views of the people of Northern Ireland should be slid under the radar because we don't have an assembly is totally against all of the devolution settlements and certainly against democracy.""Figures from the UK Department of Health show that more than 900 women from Northern Ireland travelled to England for an abortion last year.The number was an increase of more than 25% on the year before and followed a government announcement that women from Northern Ireland would be able to get free abortions in England."
2018-07-22,Call for debate on banning sales of real fur,https://web.archive.org//web/20180723021306/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44913186,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA ban on sales of real fur should be considered, a committee of MPs has recommended.The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee investigation into the issue came after some real fur was found wrongly labelled as fake.They described the current labelling of fur products as ""not fit for purpose"".The government said Brexit would allow the UK to ""go further"" when it came to introducing further restrictions on the fur trade.   Fur farming was banned in the UK in 2000, but it is legal to sell some types of real fur that have been imported, if it is accurately labelled.But the Efra committee said retailers and Trading Standards had been complacent about items being incorrectly labelled.Their inquiry came after it emerged High Street and online retailers including TK Maxx, BooHoo, Amazon and Tesco had recently sold real fur as fake. Other retailers found to have passed items off as faux fur included Not on the High Street, Groupon, Etsy, FatFace, Boots, Kurt Geiger and Romwe.  The Efra committee started its investigation in February, when cases of mislabelling came to light via reports from media and campaign groups.The MPs found that while many of the retailers concerned had no-fur policies, the so-called faux fur had actually come from animals including rabbit, fox and chinchilla.It said Brexit could be an opportunity to tighten regulations around the sale of fur and called for a consultation on a bar on the sale of all real fur. ""Many consumers have an ethical reason for not buying garments containing real fur,"" the committee's report said. ""The last few years have shown that there is vulnerability in retailers' supply chains and that real fur has been sold as fake fur. ""Our inquiry has highlighted that the current labelling system is confusing, not fit for purpose and with a high degree of non-compliance. It is also not being enforced."" The committee recognised that fur is ""a subject that raises strong feelings"", adding: ""In looking at whether to ban the sale and import of fur post-Brexit, the government will have to balance the needs of animal welfare against consumer choice.""  Committee chairman Neil Parish said: ""Reports of real fur being sold as fake fur shows that retailers are flouting their responsibility to consumers.""The mis-selling of real fur should not be discovered by campaign organisations and the media, but by Trading Standards officers and retailers.""Retailers of all sizes are complacent about the issue of fake faux fur. It is illegal to give misleading information and Trading Standards have been poor at identifying and acting against those who are doing so."" He recommended that the government should make sure local authorities had the proper resources, and Trading Standards adequate training, to help bring an end to the issue. ""Brexit provides an opportunity to step up our game when it comes to labelling,"" added Mr Parish, Conservative MP for Riverton and Honiton. ""The labelling of clothes must be consistent, transparent and customer-friendly, but current EU requirements are not good enough to allow consumers to understand the origin and contents of their clothing.""The British Fur Trade Association said it welcomed the committee's recommendations on addressing the problems of mis-selling fur and agreed the current European labelling was not fit for purpose.Chief executive Mike Moser said it was vital that consumers were able to make informed decisions, whether they were buying natural or fake fur.He wants to see a fur-specific label introduced on to the UK market which would give greater detail about the type of fur used.However, he said he was disappointed that the committee was recommending a possible trade ban,  despite acknowledging that the fur industry was a legitimate business and wearing fur was a matter of consumer choice.A government statement said: ""The government shares the British public's high regard for animal welfare, and fur farming was banned in the UK in 2000.""Trade in fur from domestic cats, dogs or commercial seal hunts are also banned, but while the UK is a member of the EU it is not possible to introduce additional restrictions on the fur trade.""Brexit gives us the opportunity to go further. Meanwhile, we will closely consider the committee's report and respond in due course.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said real fur sales should be banned.""I think fur products are unnecessary and there is often a great deal of cruelty involved in the production of fur pelts and the synthetic alternatives are much better,"" he said.

2018-07-22,Barnier questions May's Brexit plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20180723021306/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44903652,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMichel Barnier has said Theresa May's plan for a future trade relationship with the EU could weaken the single market and create burdens for business.The EU Brexit negotiator said the White Paper opened ""the way to a constructive discussion"" but must be ""workable"".He questioned whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical.Earlier, Theresa May urged the EU to ""evolve"" its position on Brexit and not fall back on unworkable proposals.Mrs May is hoping the White Paper - which sparked two cabinet resignations - will allow the two sides to reach a deal on post-Brexit relations by the autumn, so the UK can avoid leaving the EU without a deal in March next year.The White Paper proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but Mrs May says it will end free movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations.Critics at Westminster say it is an unworkable compromise which would leave the UK being governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules.Mr Barnier did not reject the White Paper out of hand, saying ""several elements"" of it were ""very useful"".But there were parts that Brussels did not understand which would need further clarification.He said his main aim was to protect the integrity of the EU single market, and the UK proposals - which would see frictionless trade in goods but not services - risked undermining that.""We are not going to negotiate on the basis of the White Paper because that's the British paper but we could use many elements of the White Paper,"" said Mr Barnier.""There's not an awful lot of justification for the EU running the risk of weakening the single market.""That is our main asset. There's no justification for us to create additional burdens on business just because the UK wants to leave."" Mr Barnier questioned the UK's plans for a ""common rulebook"" for EU-UK trade as it only referred to goods checked at the border, not areas like pesticide use, adding: ""How can we protect consumers in Europe?""He also questioned whether the plans were workable without additional bureaucracy and said there were ""practical problems"" about how tariffs would be determined and collected - under the UK's plan, EU member states would collect tariffs on the UK's behalf and vice versa.But Mr Barnier suggested the EU's controversial ""backstop"" proposal aimed at avoiding a hard Irish border could be changed: ""There will be a deal if there is an agreement on the backstop. ""It's not necessarily our backstop. We can work on this, amend it, improve our backstop ... But we need an operational backstop now, in the Withdrawal Agreement, and not later.""Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg described Mr Barnier's speech as ""aggressive"" in a tweet:Today's aggressive comments by Messrs Varadkar and Barnier show why we are right to be leaving the mafia-like European Union.End of Twitter post  by @Jacob_Rees_MoggOn a visit to Belfast on Friday, Theresa May said the ""seamless border"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic was ""a foundation stone on which the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement rests"" and the concept of a hard border was now ""almost inconceivable"".But she reiterated her opposition to the EU's ""backstop"" proposal, that would see Northern Ireland effectively staying in the single market for goods and the customs union, as ""something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept"". And she dismissed suggestions made by former foreign secretary Boris Johnson that technology could be used to avoid the need for a hard border: ""No technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border.""She said the White Paper was a ""significant development"" of the UK's position and offered a ""coherent package"".""It is now for the EU to respond - not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind.""And, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions.""Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Ireland's RTE radio there had been a ""lukewarm"" response in Brussels to the UK White Paper.He added: ""We don't have any British proposal in terms of a functioning backstop in its entirety. We have bits and pieces of ideas."""

Mrs May said the EU's backstop proposal would be a breach of the Belfast Agreement - and that her plan, agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers earlier this month, was the best way forward.If UK Govt don’t support current EU wording on Backstop in draft Withdrawal Agreement, then obligation is on them to propose a viable and legally operable alternative wording that delivers same result: no border infrastructure. Clear UK commitments were made on this in Dec+March.End of Twitter post  by @simoncoveney""What I've said to the EU is that the legal text they've produced is not acceptable, that's why we proposed an alternative to that,"" she said.She said there now needed to be a renewed focus on EU-UK negotiations with ""increased pace and intensity"".The prime minister also met several of the political parties in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald said the visit was ""anything but reassuring"".""In fact it's now clear the British prime minister has come here to pick a fight with Ireland and to pick a fight with the EU,"" Mrs McDonald said.However, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, defended the prime minister.""What she has done is set out her agenda, that's very important. She talked about working together to find solutions, and the need to work collaboratively,"" she said.Theresa May wants a backstop that would see the whole of the UK staying in the customs union for a limited period of time after the transition period - something the EU has said is unacceptable.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme the government was committed to getting a legal text for a backstop.Earlier, the Irish Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney tweeted that if the UK did not accept the EU wording on a backstop in the draft withdrawal agreement, they would have to propose an  alternative that would deliver the same result. .@theresa_may arrived to protesters shouting “your rights, our rights” @BBCNewsNI @bbcnewsline pic.twitter.com/JJwBFGFs2LEnd of Twitter post  by @KellyBonnerReacting to his comments, Mrs Bradley said while the EU had put forward a legal text, ""we do not accept it"". ""We've put forward a counter proposal and we're now working on how we get a backstop that we are committed to delivering but it has to be a backstop that respects the integrity of the whole UK and does not put a border in the Irish sea.""The Shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd, told the BBC Labour had always been ""very clear"" that the UK should be part of the customs union. EU and UK negotiators have been meeting in Brussels this week to discuss the border issue.Friday's speech in Northern Ireland marks the prime minister's first major attempt to sell the Chequers agreement since it was reached by her cabinet earlier this month.She is due to tour other parts of the UK over the summer in an attempt to persuade businesses and citizens of its benefits.Both the UK and EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit.The two sides insist it is not what they want - and that reaching a deal by the autumn is still very much on the cards.But they have yet to agree how their final relationship will work, with key issues around cross-border trade unresolved, and the UK's official departure date of 29 March 2019 fast approaching.The Republic of Ireland will remain within the EU and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said his government is making contingency plans for ""the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit"".Mrs May also addressed the impasse at Stormont.Northern Ireland has been without a government for 18 months, after power-sharing between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin collapsed.She added that until devolution is restored, the government would fulfil its responsibilities but warned interventions from Westminster were ""no substitute"" in the long-term."
2018-07-22,Government admits rabies poster gaffe,https://web.archive.org//web/20180723021306/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-44911209,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government has admitted ""mistakenly"" using a spoof poster that suggested parents should shoot children if they had rabies.The image appeared in a magazine for civil servants in a feature on the history of government communications.The poster was originally produced by the fictional Scarfolk Council, whose Twitter account parodies town life ""that did not progress beyond 1979"".The gaffe has gone viral on social media. Wow. This has made my week. This is from the government's *own* publication about the history of government communications. They mistakenly included a Scarfolk poster which encourages the killing of children. Clearly, nobody thought it was too extreme. (via @CraigHeap) pic.twitter.com/PITafePTKeEnd of Twitter post  by @ScarfolkA Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: ""This image is a parody of 1970s public information campaigns and was mistakenly used in a publication for illustrative purposes.""It was used in the printed version of the Civil Service Quarterly, along with government posters from the past 100 years, including the famous ""Careless talk costs lives"" campaign during World War Two.However, the rabies poster no longer appears in the online version of the magazine, where it has been replaced by the ""Lord Kitchener wants you"" recruitment poster from World War One.Scarfolk Council has developed a cult popularity online with its fictional depiction of a north-west England town, where ""the entire decade of the 1970s loops ad infinitum"" and ""children must not be seen or heard"".Richard Littler, who created the Scarfolk project, told Sky News he had ""no idea"" how the spoof poster ended up in the magazine. The writer, from Manchester, added: ""I'd like to think a Scarfolk fan and/or cult member infiltrated the civil service."""
2018-07-22,PM's whip excuse blatantly untrue - Labour,https://web.archive.org//web/20180723021306/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44897844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour's deputy leader Tom Watson has accused Theresa May of making ""blatantly untrue excuses"" for the behaviour of her chief whip.Mr Watson said the PM's defence of Julian Smith was ""unbelievable"" and public trust in politics was at stake.Mr Smith is under fire after telling a Tory MP to take part in a key Brexit vote, despite an agreement not to with a Lib Dem MP on maternity leave.Pressed on Friday, the PM repeated her claim it was an ""honest mistake"".Pairing is an informal arrangement between two MPs of opposing parties that allows them, with the agreement of the whips (whips are the MPs responsible for discipline in each party), to miss occasional votes in the House - for example if they are ill, off on leave or out of the country.Mr Lewis, who was paired with the Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson, did not take part in most of Tuesday's Trade Bill votes, but did take part in the two closest divisions - one on customs, which the government won by just six votes, and another on medicine regulation, which it lost.Both he and Mr Smith have apologised to Ms Swinson, who gave birth to her second son Gabriel on 29 June and is on maternity leave, saying it was an ""honest mistake"".Asked whether she endorsed her chief whip's conduct, Mrs May said: ""There was an honest mistake made for which the chief whip and Brandon Lewis have both apologised to the member concerned.""By BBC political correspondent Chris MasonThere is an old saying in politics. When you are explaining, you are losing.The Conservatives have been doing a lot of explaining on this pairing row.Tory sources are drawing a distinction between ""long-term"" pairing arrangements, such as those covering maternity leave which are sacrosanct, and ""short-term"" arrangements which, they argue, are frequently breached by all sides.The twist is they broke the long-term pair with Jo Swinson ""by accident,"" and while they acknowledge Julian Smith did ""explore and possibly instruct"" shorter-term pairs to be broken, none actually were.Labour, to put it politely, say this is rubbish. ""This is about trust and honour,"" a source tells me. ""Julian Smith has tried to cheat, and should resign.""Some Conservatives too are pretty angry. ""Tacky,"" ""dishonest,"" ""appalling"" and ""concerning"" are among the words used by some.But a government struggling to get its business through the Commons can ill afford to lose the man whose very job it is ensure it wins those votes.But they have faced furious criticism - both from Labour and the Lib Dems, and some Tory MPs - amid suspicion Mr Smith deliberately ordered MPs to break their pairing deals because the votes were so important.Labour deputy leader Mr Watson said on Friday: ""It is unbelievable that the prime minister has repeated the desperate and blatantly untrue excuses made by her party chair and chief whip.""This is a serious issue that goes beyond efficient administration in the House of Commons. This is about public trust in politics. At such a crucial time for our country, people expect candour and decency, not cowardice and dishonesty.""He said if Mr Lewis and Mr Smith would not resign, Mrs May ""should find the strength to sack them"".""From forcing seriously ill MPs into the Commons in their wheelchairs, carrying sick buckets, to cheating a new mum out of her vote, this government is rotten to its core."" The Lib Dems have called on chief whip Mr Smith to explain himself after reports he told Mr Lewis and two other Tory MPs that they should go ahead and vote, despite being paired. Two of the MPs are reported to have refused to break their pairing arrangements.Conservative backbencher Philip Davies, who on Thursday became the third Conservative to declare publicly that he has submitted a letter of no confidence in Theresa May's leadership, told BBC Newsnight he had had his ""differences"" with the chief whip.But he said Mr Smith had ""always been completely honourable, decent, I have never questioned his integrity once"".""My understanding is that in this Parliament alone the pairings have been broken over 50 times .. and the overwhelming majority of those times, it was broken by opposition parties,"" he added.Referring to the absence of the Lib Dem leader and his predecessor from Tuesday's votes, Mr Davies said: ""I think this is a diversion tactic from the Lib Dems because Vince Cable and Tim Farron couldn't be bothered to turn up for a vote.""But other Conservative MPs, including Anna Soubry, Peter Bone and Heidi Allen, have also raised concerns. Mrs Allen said the chief whip had been ""unable to confirm to me that he did not give instructions to break pairs"" and she could ""only conclude MPs were told to break pairs on Tuesday"".""I refuse to be tarnished by this behaviour so will not stand by and say nothing. Integrity and honesty are fundamental to our democracy. Anything less is unacceptable."""
2018-07-22,Thousands of attacks on council staff,https://web.archive.org//web/20180723021306/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-44114404,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowCouncil workers in Wales have been attacked almost 6,500 times in the last four years - with one stabbed and another hit by a car.Staff including refuse collectors, librarians, teachers and social workers were abused, with some getting death threats.The figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, were given to BBC Wales by all councils except Cardiff.Unions said better safety measures were needed to stop the ""appalling attacks"".Alison Hulmes, a social worker, told how a man threatened her when she was visiting his elderly mother, saying ""it's really easy to find out where you live"".She spoke of colleagues needing police protection after being traced on social media, and said she was scared the man who threatened her was going to follow her to her house where her young children were.""It was really frightening, I wondered if he was going to follow me... It was really clear that I wasn't going to drive home in case he followed me in his car to my house,"" she said.In the four years from April 2014, council employees were attacked at work 6,421 times, with at least 3,500 of these being physical assaults, according to figures.But the real numbers could be much higher as Cardiff council, the largest local authority in Wales, said it did not hold the data. It is also not clear how many incidents were referred to the police.A number of motorists used their cars as weapons in rows over parking fines, while one school worker was ""stabbed several times"" by a pupil in Bridgend, although it is not clear what with.While the majority of physical attacks were on those working in care homes, social services and education, a number of bin workers, planning officers, traffic wardens, librarians, museum staff and leisure centre workers were also assaulted, with staff being left with lacerations, bite marks, bruises and burns.In Bridgend, a traffic warden was beckoned to a car he had just issued a fine to, and then had a substance squirted in his face - which later turned out not to be toxic. Another was followed and beaten, while one was threatened by a man who said he had ""a knife"".One parking officer was hit by a car mirror when a motorist drove at him before getting out and attacking him. Another aimed his car at an attendant and drove at him ""at speed"", only stopping when he realised the warden was standing near a lamp post. One warden was told to ""kill himself"" and ""burn in hell"", while another was punched in the face after issuing a ticket to a man who had wrongly parked in a disabled bay.Hardback books, Jenga blocks, drawing pins, and even plaster casts were thrown at teachers and classroom assistants - others were punched in the face or bitten, and some were threatened by pupils with knives and scissors. Some of the worst threats were made against social workers, with one mother threatening to shoot her child's social worker in the head, while one father said he would ""stab them in the eyes"".A prisoner was also heard by guards threatening to kill a social worker, and one support worker was assaulted by a child, who pushed her into the road, causing her to hit her head on the kerb, before she was repeatedly kicked in the head. Recycling centre staff in Anglesey were verbally abused 15 times, with one staff member assaulted, while lollipop ladies were sworn at in front of children. When Alison Hulmes went to a remote house with a poor mobile signal to visit a mum with alcohol issues she did not expect to be abused.""It was clear immediately that mum was very intoxicated,"" said Mrs Hulme, a social worker in the Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend areas, with more than 18 years experience.""She'd been smashing things in the room, very quickly she came up to me and was shouting in my face, she was screaming and starting to make fist gestures and put her fists up to my face.""Mrs Hulmes, who is a representative of the British Association of Social Workers (BASW), said while staff always did risk assessments and had ""get out"" plans, being in the situation was ""extremely frightening"".She added that the hostility was getting worse due to austerity as people were desperate, while staff were stretched.""Social workers have not been able to drive home, people have found out where they live through social media, and have either tracked them or followed them, so they have been too afraid to go home at night, and have needed police protection,"" she said.The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said while serious incidents were rare it was ""deeply concerning"" that a small section of the public felt it was acceptable to abuse public servants.Councillor David Poole said: ""These people are teachers, social workers, refuse workers or park wardens. ""They are hard-working, caring, committed people, delivering vital everyday services to people in our communities. Councils provide support to their staff who are victims of abuse, which includes counselling, and warnings are issued to individuals, and more serious matters are referred directly to the police.""Margaret Thomas, assistant general secretary for Unison, said the figures were ""appalling"" and ""no-one should be in fear at work or return home injured"".""Assaults and intimidation are completely unacceptable. We are campaigning for the strongest safeguards for our members and all public service workers with zero tolerance towards perpetrators,"" she said.The Welsh Government said staff deserved to do their jobs without fear of violence or harassment."

On the stage with the prime minister were 45 celebrities, rounded up by the entrepreneur and Conservative fundraiser Sir Basil Feldman. They included some of the biggest names in TV at the time, including Ronnie Corbett, Jimmy Tarbuck, Bob Monkhouse and Shirley Bassey.Mrs Thatcher won, of course, and a few months later decided to give a party to thank her showbiz supporters. Forty-five guests would not fill up the grand reception rooms at Number 10 Downing Street, so the list, now revealed by the Thatcher Archive, was expanded. John Whittingdale, then Mrs Thatcher's political secretary, suggested Paul McCartney, Cliff Richard, Freddie Mercury and Mick Jagger as guests. The first two made the list, drawn up by the ministry for the arts: government ministers were added, as were civil list pensioners and sportsmen and women.This guest list, which contained 229 names, not including spouses, was copied by Mrs Thatcher's private office to Denis Thatcher, who was to co-host the party.He wrote back: ""Whilst I accept of course that not everyone who comes to our receptions are necessarily on our side I find it both unpleasant and embarrassing to entertain those who publicly insult the PM. ""This list therefore needs some careful checking in this regard.""He went through it with a red pen, ticking ""those who I would personally like to see included"" and putting a question mark by ""those who I believe do NOT help"". He added that more than one tick ""means super person and a known friend and wonderful to have them here"".Top of his list was the comic and actor Eric Sykes, who got four ticks by his name. The golfer Peter Alliss got three -  Ronnie Corbett got two ticks, as did Penelope Keith, Judith Chalmers, Tim Rice and others. More intriguing are his question marks. The artists Gilbert and George, described as ""image makers"", got two. Single question marks went to Jan Leeming, Paul Daniels and Shirley Bassey, who'd been at the Wembley rally, Paul McCartney and, oddest of all, David Attenborough.Richard Ingrams, who for many years wrote the Dear Bill letters in Private Eye magazine, purporting to be the private correspondence of Denis Thatcher to a golfing friend, has his own theory about the ticks and crosses.""One of the few things we know about Denis is that he had a very low opinion of the BBC. He thought that BBC people were all pinkos."" That might explain why Sir David got a question mark - or perhaps Denis mixed up his Attenboroughs. David's brother, the actor and director Richard, was a longstanding Labour supporter.""It's very unusual to have Denis interfering,"" Mr Ingrams adds.""Denis loved his wife and wanted to protect her, and kept out of the limelight himself. He used to say a whale only gets shot if it spouts.""Chris Collins, director of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation and editor of its vast archive website, agrees it was ""unusual"" for Denis Thatcher to involve himself to this extent. The reason, he adds, may be an earlier episode in which Mrs Thatcher considered suing BBC Radio 4's Today programme for libel over a satirical entry in a short-story competition, entitled Thatcherism: The Final Solution, which aired in January 1988.Mr Thatcher wrote a personal letter of complaint to the BBC's then chairman Marmaduke Hussey, saying that never had ""so foul a libel been published against anyone, let alone a prime minister"".Mr Collins adds that: ""The special coded system of question marks and ticks and crosses, that's actually slightly unusual.""Certainly the steam is coming out of his ears at various points in 1988 and this party he jumps on.""The final guest list included only the original 45 names, plus the 1988 British Winter Olympics team - and the parliamentary skiing team. Eddie ""the Eagle"" Edwards, whose efforts at that winter's Games had won him admirers around the world, wasn't there: he had a prior charity engagement.Richard Ingrams never met Denis Thatcher when he was writing Dear Bill, but he did later invite him to a lunch for the Oldie magazine, which Mr Ingrams founded and edited. After that, he came, as a paying punter, to literary lunches, always sending a handwritten ""thank you"" card.""And so that's quite funny, that for this party he comes down hard on people who've written unfavourably about The Boss [Margaret Thatcher], that he chose to fraternise with me! Albeit once her political career was over.""And did they ever talk about the Dear Bill letters? ""No, he never mentioned them. But maybe he thought that was just being polite.""Could Philip May ever play the same role? Richard Ingrams thinks not. ""He's playing the Denis role of keeping his trap shut. We know very little about Philip May. But Mrs May doesn't really measure up to Thatcher.""Members of the public will be able to browse through the archive from Monday 23 July by visiting www.margaretthatcher.org."

It includes advice on how countries, companies and individuals should prepare for the prospect of the UK leaving with ""no deal"" in place. BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris has read the document so you don't have to. Here are some key excerpts, and explanations of what they mean: From the outset, the EU makes one thing clear - even if negotiations go better than expected, it thinks there will be significant disruption, and everyone needs to be ready for it. (The EU talks about 30 March as exit day, by the way, because the precise time of withdrawal is due to be midnight on 30 March in Central European Time, but 23:00 on 29 March in GMT). The document emphasises that negotiations on a withdrawal agreement are continuing and that a negotiated settlement is the EU's preferred outcome.But it also notes that important issues remain unresolved - including on the protection of personal data sent to the UK while it was a member state and on the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in policing a withdrawal agreement. In particular, it states that there has been ""no progress"" in agreeing a ""backstop"" solution to avoid the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The EU notes, as it has done many times before, that time to both reach and ratify an agreement is running short. This is why preparations for ""no deal"" are so important. If there is a deal, there will also be a transition period running until 31 December 2020 during which EU rules and regulations will continue to apply in the UK. That will give businesses and governments more time to prepare for a new relationship. Without a deal, the transition (or ""implementation period"" as the UK government calls it) falls away and the relationship will change abruptly at the end of March next year. If both sides come to the conclusion several months before the end of March that there will be ""no deal"", they can at least make some contingency plans to deal with that. But if there is a last-minute hitch, time will have run out. So, from the EU's perspective, thinking about ""no deal"" means ""preparing for the worst and hoping for the best"". Much of the UK government would probably look at it in the same way - but there are many Brexiteers who think that ""no deal"" would be perfectly acceptable as long as sufficient preparations have been made.  This kind of language is scattered throughout the document. ""Don't say we didn't warn you,"" would be another way of putting it. The document stresses that some things will have to be done whatever the outcome. One thing it mentions is the need for companies to take steps to ensure that they have the right authorisations and certificates to access the EU market after Brexit. But contingency planning for ""no deal"" is the main emphasis - the EU says this is a prudent step because the outcome of negotiations ""cannot be predicted"". Among other issues, it notes that there would be no arrangement in place for EU citizens in the UK or UK citizens in the EU. It says controls at borders ""could cause significant delays, eg in road transport, and difficulties for ports"", where there could be ""long lines of vehicles waiting for customs procedures to be fulfilled"". It also says that the UK would become a third country for trade and regulatory issues, which would ""represent a significant drawback compared to the current level of market integration"". It also emphasises that while many measures would have to be taken at EU level, national, regional and local governments also need to step up their levels of preparation to ""mitigate the worst impacts of a potential cliff-edge scenario"" - cheerful stuff. And of course a lot of the attention is focused on making sure that individual EU businesses, big and small, are going to be ready for whatever emerges at the end of a highly unpredictable process of negotiation. The document notes that several EU governments, such as the Irish and the Dutch, have set up online platforms to help their companies prepare for different potential Brexit scenarios. The document also claims - in a sentence that won't please the UK government - that ""many companies are relocating to the EU27"" or expanding their operations there. EU officials insist that they are not trying to add fuel to the fire and that they are simply engaged in prudent planning. But it's a reminder that there are people in Europe, as well as in the UK, who see Brexit as an opportunity rather than a threat. The commission has now published 68 notices (anyone with a few hours to spare can read them here) on preparations in specific sectors of the economy, including health and food safety, financial services, customs, transport, and company law. They set out the legal and technical issues that governments and companies need to take into account and are another glimpse into the complexities of Brexit that stretch into every area of economic life.  In the UK, the government has not yet published any comparable information of its own.However, on Wednesday, Theresa May told MPs at the Liaison Committee that a similar number of technical notifications about what to do in the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit will be released during August and September - aimed at businesses and citizens.In response to the EU document, the Department for Exiting the European Union said ""It is the duty of any responsible government to prepare for every eventuality, including the unlikely scenario that we reach March 2019 without agreeing a deal. We have already done a lot of work behind the scenes to prepare for this - it is only natural that our European partners would seek to make similar preparations. We are keen to work closely with the EU on preparedness issues.""There are all sorts of EU databases, including many dealing with policing and internal security issues, to which the UK wants to retain access after Brexit. But the EU has argued that the UK can't simply pick and choose the bits of membership it likes - and this part of the document emphasises that work is well under way to remove the UK from numerous databases and IT systems once it becomes a ""third country"". The commission is also making preparations for changing international agreements that currently involve the UK as a member state. It says it will notify its international partners formally once it has sufficient certainty about the outcome of the current negotiations - not for a while, then. Finally, the EU document says work is under way to relocate or reassign tasks that are currently performed in the UK - such as the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre (part of the EU's project for satellites in space) or the UK-based EU Reference Laboratories - because it will not be possible ""to entrust a third country"" with such EU tasks after the withdrawal date. Two London-based agencies, the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority, are already moving to Amsterdam and Paris respectively. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-07-22,Profile: Ian Paisley,https://web.archive.org//web/20180723021306/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44885043,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIan Paisley's sanction for breaking parliamentary rules, which could see him suspended from the House of Commons for 30 days, is the latest chapter in a political career that has combined controversy with huge popularity at the ballot box.The youngest child of Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) founder Ian Paisley, Ian Paisley Jr entered elected politics in 1996 and took over as MP for his father's former North Antrim constituency in 2010.But controversy - whether surrounding his views on homosexuality or allegations of lobbying on a £50m government land deal - has never been far away.If he is suspended from the Commons for failing to declare the details of two family holidays in 2013 - paid for by the Sri Lankan government - it could deprive Theresa May's government of a crucial vote in crunch Brexit debates.Mr Paisley and his nine DUP colleagues in Westminster found themselves cast as kingmakers after the Conservative party fell short of a majority in the 2017 general election, which led to a confidence-and-supply deal between the two parties.The youngest of five children, Mr Paisley's interest in unionist politics was evident long before his election to the Northern Ireland Forum in 1996.After attending Shaftesbury House College and Methodist College Belfast, he studied modern history and Irish politics at Queen's University Belfast.During his time as a student, he made a very public demonstration against the dropping of God Save the Queen from graduation ceremonies.He and Peter Weir, now a DUP colleague, stood during the ceremony and played the British national anthem on a small tape recorder.ResignationIn 1998, he was elected to the new Northern Ireland Assembly, easing home on the second count behind his father, who topped the poll.In 2007, on the same day his father became first minister of Northern Ireland, he was appointed a junior minister in the devolved administration.But he served less than a year in the post before resigning, following criticism of his links to developer Seymour Sweeney, on whose behalf he allegedly lobbied over a £50m government land deal in his constituency.An ombudsman ruled there was no evidence to suggest he had broken assembly rules, but he stepped down, saying: ""The criticism has been a distraction and has got in the way of the activities of this government and importantly it has gotten in the way of the activities of my political party.""Mr Paisley's personal views have been the subject of criticism, particularly his opinions on homosexuality.In 2005 he was formally censured by the Northern Ireland Policing Board for describing homosexual relationships as ""immoral, offensive and obnoxious.""Two years later, he was accused by Sinn Féin of ""dangerous homophobia"" after being quoted in Ireland's Hot Press magazine as saying: ""I am pretty repulsed by gay and lesbianism. I think it is wrong.""In 2011, Mr Paisley said his views had changed: He told The House magazine that he had ""grown up"" since those comments.""I have huge respect for people no matter what their religious and social background,"" he said.""I think I have grown up since then. I have strong Christian beliefs and moral viewpoints, but you have to realise that while sin is black and white, life is a lot of grey.""He also faced criticism after saying police officers should ""shoot dissident republicans on sight"", later adding that officers ""should have the opportunity to employ lethal force against those who would seek to kill them.""But the controversies have done nothing to damage his popularity with voters in North Antrim. In 2010, he was elected as the MP for the constituency and has been re-elected twice since then. At the 2017 general election he cruised to victory with 59% of the vote.Following his censure over failing to declare details of his Sri Lankan holidays, many constituents told the BBC they remained supportive of the father-of-four, who has been married to paediatric nurse Fiona since 1990.Along with a passion for motorbikes, he lists his interests in Who's Who as his children, Chinese food, cinema and rugby.Despite being the son of the DUP's founder, Mr Paisley has not felt constrained to toe the party line on all occasions. When former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness retired in January 2017, Mr Paisley's tributes were notably warmer than many other unionist politicians.He told BBC NI's The View programme he wanted to thank former IRA commander Mr McGuinness, who struck a historic power-sharing deal with his father in 2007.His profile was raised after last year's DUP-Conservative deal, and he has been a strong supporter of Brexit, and US President Donald Trump.During the annual St Patrick's Day celebrations at the White House, Mr Paisley tweeted that he was the ""only person from NI to be invited to a private family reception"".He also invited Mr Trump to visit Northern Ireland and posted a selfie with First Lady Melania Trump on Twitter. Mr Paisley's interaction with another famous Twitter user saw him come under fire: He apologised after retweeting a comment by right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins, which read: ""March 2018. London has a higher murder rate than New York... and Ramadan's not yet begun.""He later deleted the comment and apologised, saying he had ""did not take cognisance of Ramadan reference"".That apology was followed on Thursday by an emotional statement in the House of Commons in which he admitted a ""deep personal embarrassment"" following the Sri Lankan holiday rule breach.He could now face a by-election for his seat in North Antrim, where his popularity with voters, undimmed until now, would be tested in different circumstances.

2018-07-22,What was the goal?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180723021306/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44871637,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt's the first Boris Johnson speech that I can remember watching that didn't have any jokes. For his allies, that was the point. It wasn't designed, they say, to make a personal attack on Theresa May. But my goodness, it made a pretty savage attack on her policies - a ""fog of self-doubt"", ""pretending to the electorate"", ""a fantastical Heath Robinson"" proposal on customs, ""miserable permanent limbo"".For someone who less than a fortnight ago celebrated collective cabinet responsibility at Chequers, that's quite some feat.But it makes me wonder exactly what was being said on the Chequers terrace when we captured Mr Johnson and Mrs May in what looked like vigorous conversation 10 days ago. What the speech today was designed to do, his supporters hope, was to present the former foreign secretary without the wisecracks, as a serious politician who is determined to argue for what he believes. His now small band of supporters circled him on the green benches as he spoke. He made the case for the Prime Minister's first big Brexit plan, her speech at Lancaster House back in January 2017 when she first outlined some of her aims and explicitly, completely and totally ruled out staying in the single market. For some Brexiteers Mr Johnson's words will be hugely welcome, a call to stop the rot as they would see it. One former minister told me plainly ""he was right - Lancaster House is a distant memory"", even comparing Mr Johnson's words to the closing scene of Gladiator when Russell Crowe playing the former all powerful Roman General Maximus, bloodied and staggering, said, ""there was a dream that was Rome that shall be realized"".The message, one man's dream can inspire a great many others to glory. Forget for a moment it didn't exactly end well for that particular Roman. But the question this afternoon is whether the speech can start the process of restoring Boris Johnson to his former political glory and more importantly of course, will it make a blind bit of difference to Brexit. On the first point, as Mr Johnson sat down along with some cheers, I heard another MP though call, ""is that it?"" His many critics will point to what was not in the speech, a new plan for Brexit. A government minister told me it was more of his ""deluded fantasy"" saying his ""simplistic notions"" about what could be achieved when we leave the EU won't compensate for what we could lose. Another MP told me ""it didn't really go anywhere, it had no substance"". The other crucial difference in pushing for the Lancaster House model is that it ignores the not inconsiderable fact that that speech and that set of proposals was developed before the general election, before Theresa May shot herself in the foot. Mr Johnson however will, after today's speech, be a well-known, prominent voice who has made it plain he will fight against the prime minister's current stance and any attempts to compromise further. With the turmoil in the Tory party, having him on the loose could, in time, make a difference. Not least, he is one of the few politicians in the country who is known, for good or for ill, by his first name. That is as much of a risk as an asset but it's real, and those who supported Brexit may well listen.For him, today was not about intentionally blasting into a leadership race, but trying to rebuild a new, for the want of a better word, brand of Boris Johnson. The clownish caricature that saw him through much of his time as Mayor of London and the referendum didn't wash as foreign secretary. After that, the number of MPs he excites as a potential leader is tiny these days. But today's speech was not an immediate call but a pitch to get him back in the long term game. It seems unlikely right now after the last couple of years. But one of his detractors grudgingly admitted ""he's never quite the busted flush"". "

But do they make a difference to getting on in politics?""I think that in this chamber a Brummie accent is a very rare thing. And I look forward to changing that!""So said Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, when she gave her maiden speech in the House of Commons in 2015.Accents are rich in sound but, as Ms Phillips emphasised, they are heavy in baggage that we load on to others and others load on to us.But do we all have an accent, wherever we come from?""We do. It is linguistically impossible to not have an accent,"" Rob Drummond, a linguist at Manchester Metropolitan University, says.""But the very fact that some people think they don't have an accent tells us something interesting about society. Because the people who think they don't, tend to be the people who have an accent from around the south-east of England.""This is still perceived as some kind of a standard way of speaking, but of course the only way it is perceived to be standard is because it is where the seat of power - between London and Oxford and Cambridge - traditionally has been.""There are MPs who have had problems being understood in the Commons. Alan Brown, the SNP MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun in Ayrshire is one. So too is Emma Lewell-Buck, who has been the Labour MP for South Shields on Tyneside since 2013.""Hansard would often ask for clarification. I type my speeches out in full now, to make Hansard's job easier, for clarity,"" Ms Lewell-Buck says, referring to the team that transcribes every word spoken in Parliament.""I think there are a hell of a lot more accents and regional voices in there, even in the time I've been in there,"" she adds. ""It makes it more a vibrant Parliament. It makes it sound like the country it represents a bit more.""But both Mr Brown and Ms Lewell-Buck have encountered the same thing back in their constituencies: surprise from locals that their MP sounds like they do. A welcome surprise, but a surprise nonetheless.It is a ""snobbery element in reverse"", reflects Mr Brown.I am fascinated by accents.Not just because I am intensely proud of my roots in the Yorkshire Dales, but because as a reporter, voice is more than just our vocal fingerprint. On the radio it is the whole professional ""us"".And believe me, you become very aware, very early on in a career in my game, that phonetic diversity matters. It is a badge of difference, for better or worse.I will never forget the observation from my year as a trainee in 2001 when I found out a kindly soul had predicted of my future: ""He won't get on the air with a voice like that."" As it happens, I rather suspect I have been incredibly fortunate in my timing - my career starting at just the point it was seen to be fashionable to have more regional accents in broadcasting. I also suspect there is probably a greater prejudice in our industry now against voices perceived to be posh.But is this hang-up about accents uniquely British? No, it turns out. Philippe Blanchet, a professor of linguistics at the University of Rennes, says French presidents ""speak with a neutral, standardised pronunciation, which is based on the one that comes from the higher classes in Paris"".""They are not supposed to have an accent. Because in France when people say you have an accent, it means that you don't use the standardised pronunciation,"" he says, adding: ""The least accepted accents in France are those of the northern part of the country and those from working-class urban and rural parts of the country.""A rather familiar observation...So, could a UK prime minister ever have a Brummie accent?I do not say this with a huge amount of conviction, but I think the answer is, probably, possibly, yes. If they were seen by their party and the country to be a worthy leader on every other metric of these things, maybe they could turn their accent to their advantage, claim it to be the very essence of modernity and a new politics.And yet, there is still evidence that prejudice could stand in their way. A poll by YouGov in 2014 put the Brummie accent at the bottom of a league table for ""the most attractive accents in the British Isles"".It is one of the reasons why I wrote ""probably, possibly"" a few sentences ago."
2018-07-22,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180723021306/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-22,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180723021306/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

""We know that the European Union has its interests, overall interests, so not just individual member-states but EU institutions. ""And of course Britain doesn't want to unnecessarily complicate framework conditions for economic activity, but also security questions, or our foreign policy cooperation. ""It becomes more difficult anyway as a non-member of the European Union. ""So, we've agreed we will prepare bilaterally for the time after Brexit.""Mr Hunt said a no deal would be ""challenging"" but the UK would still ""thrive economically"".Excellent discussion with German Foreign Minister @HeikoMaas about the unintended geopolitical consequences of No Deal. Only person rejoicing would be Putin...End of Twitter post  by @Jeremy_HuntThe UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work afterwards.Mr Hunt's trip to Germany comes at the start of a concerted push by British government ministers to sell the UK's latest Brexit blueprint across the Continent.Prime Minister Theresa May will meet the Austrian chancellor and Czech and Estonian prime ministers this week, saying both sides know ""the clock is ticking"" on negotiations. The EU and the UK want a deal in place by October.Speaking to workers at a factory in Newcastle, Mrs May said she was working to get a deal that MPs would support when it comes before Parliament - but was also ""stepping up"" government preparations for no deal being reached.She was asked about Treasury forecasts of an economic hit to the North East of England after Brexit - in response she said the government wanted ""frictionless"" trade at borders and also promised investment in transport infrastructure and skills.And asked how she unwinds from the ""world's most stressful job"", she said she enjoyed walking, cooking and watching US crime TV series NCIS.The government's plan has been set out in a White Paper which proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but will end free movement of people and the direct jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK.Critics at Westminster say it is an unworkable compromise, which would leave the UK governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules.The plan sparked two cabinet resignations - former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. After Parliament rises for the summer recess on Tuesday, Downing Street said the UK negotiating team would be travelling to Brussels while the foreign secretary, chancellor, home secretary, business secretary and the minister for the Cabinet Office will meet counterparts across Europe.The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, questioned on Friday whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical and said the EU would not run the risk of weakening its single market.He questioned whether the plans could work without causing extra bureaucracy and said there were ""practical problems"" about how tariffs would be determined and collected.New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said a deal could be done by October - but also that making ""no deal"" preparations such as hiring extra border staff was part of being a ""responsible government"".The Times has reported that the head of Amazon in the UK, Doug Gurr, warned of potential ""civil unrest"" in the event of ""no deal"" at a meeting with Mr Raab on Friday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it seemed the government's priority was preparing for no deal, which would be bad for industry. ""There has to be a serious stepping-up of negotiations to reach an agreement on customs and on trade,"" he said."
2018-07-23,UK stance on IS duo 'a rare decision',https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44925638,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK's opposition to the death penalty has not changed, the security minister has said - after a government letter about two IS suspects emerged.Ben Wallace said the message from Home Secretary Sajid Javid to the US attorney general - that the UK would not ""require assurances"" over the death penalty - was a ""rare decision"".But Labour said the UK was abandoning a ""principled opposition"".The IS suspects were captured in Syria and could be sent to the US for trial.Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheik, from London, are accused of being the last two members of an IS cell dubbed ""The Beatles"", which killed Western hostages.After the pair were caught in January by US-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters they complained they would not get a fair trial because the UK government had stripped them of their British citizenship.The UK could provide intelligence as part of the men's prosecution in the US.For years, Britain sought assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used in cases where the UK provided information or extradited suspects.But, in a letter leaked to the Telegraph, Mr Javid said he would seek no assurances about Kotey and Elsheik's sentences.Asking an urgent question in the Commons, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said it was not possible to be a ""little bit in favour"" of the death penalty.Describing the UK stance as ""abhorrent and shameful"", she called on ministers ""even at this late stage to reverse this decision"".But Mr Wallace maintained ministers had complied with the European Convention on Human Rights and international law in relation to the cases.He said: ""The crimes that we are talking about involve the beheading and videoing of those beheadings of dozens of innocent people by one of the most abhorrent organisations walking this Earth. ""And simply to say if we were unable to prosecute them in this country, that we should simply let them free to roam around the United Kingdom... is simply bizarre and not justice to the victims.""Mr Wallace was challenged by MPs from all parties to explain the decision.Former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve said it represented a ""major departure from normal policy"" and the ""issue is going to continue to haunt the government"".Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said the home secretary had ""unilaterally ripped up"" the UK's principles, adding: ""What the minister [Mr Wallace] has said today is a contradiction of the longstanding abolition of the death penalty strategy.""By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondentWhy might Mr Javid take this decision, in apparent breach of long-standing British policy?Perhaps the real motivation is the government's desperation to avoid having to try these two men in Britain. Cases like these are extremely difficult to prosecute because of the difficulty in obtaining evidence, finding witnesses, and establishing what crimes have been committed in which jurisdiction. And in his letter, Mr Javid argues that a more successful prosecution is more likely in the US where laws are different to the UK. What ministers and MPs believe is that Mr Javid is attempting to smooth the way for the Americans to take the cases by letting them know that the UK will not, for once, kick up a fuss about the death penalty. In other words, this is all part of a deal. Read more from JamesNormally, Britain seeks assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used when the UK provided information or extradited suspects.Number 10 said it was ""a long-standing position of the government to oppose the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle"". But it added that - in the case of ""the Beatles"" - it was ""a priority to make sure that these men face criminal prosecution"".The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said a senior British government official says this was not the first time that the UK had dropped its request for assurances that the death penalty would not be used - although they did not go into details.But our correspondent said if the pair were sent to the controversial US military prison Guantanamo Bay - where some suspects have been detained for years without trial - the UK would withhold intelligence.Amnesty International said the UK was ""leaving the door wide open to charges of hypocrisy and double standards"".Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheik were members of an IS cell known as the Beatles, because of their British accents.The group - which  included two others from west London, Mohammed Emwazi, nicknamed ""Jihadi John"", and Aine Davis - were radicalised in the UK before travelling to Syria.US officials believe they beheaded more than 27 Western hostages and tortured many more.Each was known to their hostages by their respective Beatles moniker - Paul, Ringo, John and George.Emwazi, who was the alleged ringleader and appeared in videos showing hostages being beheaded, was killed by a drone strike in 2015.Davis was convicted of being a senior IS member and was jailed in Turkey last year.UK-born Kotey is of Ghanaian and Greek Cypriot background, while Sudan-born Elsheikh came to London as a child and later became a British citizen."
2018-07-23,Hodge stands by criticism of Corbyn,https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44919875,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour veteran Dame Margaret Hodge has stood by her criticism of Jeremy Corbyn over anti-Semitism - as MPs defied the party's executive on the issue.""I blew my top,"" Dame Margaret said, describing her reaction to Labour adopting new anti-Semitism guidelines.Labour MPs want the party to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism, as well as all the examples it lists.Labour says its version ""expands on and contextualises"" the IHRA definition.Labour's new code of conduct was approved by its National Executive Committee last week, but it was criticised by Jewish leaders and some of its own MPs.Although it includes the definition of anti-Semitism given by the IHRA, it has not incorporated all of the IHRA's ""working examples"".Labour MPs will vote in September on whether to adopt the full IHRA wording after passing an emergency motion at a meeting on Monday night.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the 5 September ballot was likely to put Labour MPs on a collision course with the party machine.Labour has already said it will ""reopen development of the code"" in consultation with Jewish groups.Dame Margaret is facing Labour disciplinary action after confronting Mr Corbyn in the Commons last week, reportedly swearing at him and calling him an anti-Semite. Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, she said that when she found out Labour had, despite criticism, adopted the new guidelines: ""I blew my top.""And I thought rather than do what politicians usually do, and talk each other down behind our backs, I would go and confront him.""She said she told him that ""for Jewish people to vote Labour was becoming exceedingly tough"".Earlier, the Barking MP insisted she would not leave the party, saying: ""I am going to fight within the Labour Party - and it is terrible that in 2018 I have to do that.""Mr Corbyn has said he is ""committed to eliminating anti-Semitism wherever it exists"".""Prejudice and hatred of Jewish people has no place whatsoever in the Labour Party,"" he said earlier this year.The Labour leader in the House of Lords, Baroness Smith, said there was no point agreeing a definition of anti-Semitism if it alienated the Jewish community.She told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that adopting the full international definition was ""the way forward"".Labour's code of conduct was drawn up after the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry. It followed allegations of anti-Semitism within party ranks.The code does reproduce the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and lists behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples provided by the IHRA definition:But Labour has insisted that while the examples are not reproduced word for word, they are covered elsewhere in the new code.Labour's code says it is ""wrong"" to accuse Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than their own country. And it says that using Nazi comparisons in Israel-Palestine debates ""carries a strong risk of being regarded as prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party"", triggering a disciplinary investigation.Labour's code says: ""The party is clear that the Jewish people have the same right to self-determination as any other people. ""To deny that right is to treat the Jewish people unequally and is therefore a form of anti-Semitism.""The code also says Israel's conduct should be assessed ""against the requirements of international law or the standards of behaviour expected of democratic states"" and that double standards should not be applied.A party spokeswoman said: ""The code of conduct adopts the IHRA (International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance) definition and expands on and contextualises the IHRA examples to produce robust, legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases."""
2018-07-23,Sinn Féin says UK rowing back on backstop,https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44918290,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe president of Sinn Féin has accused the British government of ""seeking to row back"" on commitments to the Brexit backstop. Mary Lou McDonald was speaking after meeting the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels.She repeated a call for a special EU summit in September to resolve the Irish border issue in time for the crunch October summit.The border has been the sticking point in the Brexit talks. The UK and EU have agreed there should be no hard border in Ireland, but are split over how to achieve it. Ms McDonald met the EU's chief Brexit negotiator along with deputy leader Michelle O'Neill on Monday.She said Mr Barnier had reiterated that there would no be withdrawal agreement without a protocol that ""deals with the Irish question"".Following the prime minister's visit to Belfast last week she said Theresa May's ""intervention"" had been ""unhelpful"". ""She said she had come to Ireland to listen and reassure people - in our view she did neither,"" said Ms McDonald.The UK and the EU agree that a backstop - effectively a safety net - is needed to avoid a hard border but disagree on what it should look like.The backstop is needed if appropriate customs arrangements cannot be agreed in time for the end of the transition period in December 2020.With the deadlock ongoing, both the UK and the EU are stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" Brexit.During a visit to Londonderry on Monday, Tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney said that a no-deal Brexit would be ""catastrophic for Britain but also very bad news for Ireland"".""I don't think there are any upsides to a no-deal scenario for the EU in any circumstances either,"" he said.""Really, the responsibility is on all of us to find a way forward. I believe we will find a way forward, I'm optimistic."" Meanwhile, Ms McDonald warned that it was ""unacceptable for the British government to consistently roll back on commitments they've made"". ""It's very clear that Brexit raises very specific difficulties for the island of Ireland and we need a specific mechanism that protects the Good Friday Agreement, that ensures no hardening of the border and ensures no diminutions of citizens' rights.""The Sinn Féin delegation told Mr Barnier that the party wants to see the EU's backstop protected in legal text of the overall withdrawal agreement, and that it should apply until another solution is found. ""I'm very pleased that in the course of our meeting Mr Barnier reiterated that there will be no withdrawal agreement without a protocol that deals with the Irish question and protects interests north and south,"" said Ms McDonald.She said the challenge was now for ""the British side"".""If they don't like the EU's protocol they need to produce their own, but it has to meet the specific needs and the agreed aims and objectives"".On Friday, Prime Minister Theresa May said the EU needed to ""evolve"" its position on the proposals it had put forward regarding the Irish border in its White Paper. She wants a ""temporary customs arrangement"" to apply to the whole of the UK, keeping it in a customs union with the EU for a limited period after the end of the proposed transition period. The EU had proposed a backstop that would have kept Northern Ireland in the EU customs union, but the UK rejected that and said it would have created a border down the Irish Sea."
2018-07-23,Recycled packaging 'may end up in landfill',https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44905576,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowYou try to be virtuous, wiping the curdling yoghurt off a plastic pot, then putting it in the recycling bin. Perhaps you envisage the pot eventually re-incarnated as a frisbee or maybe even a plastic bench.But don’t rest easy. Your pot might get burned or buried in landfill, and you’d never know.The National Audit Office (NAO) says over half of the packaging reported as recycled is actually being sent abroad to be processed. As a result, it says, the government has little idea of whether the recyclables are getting turned into new products, buried in landfill or burned. While an illusion of success has been created by the UK’s system for recycling packaging, the NAO says, the reality may be quite different.Its report finds that:Exporting our wasteThe UK is said to have increased recycling from under a third in 1998 to nearly two thirds last year, easily beating the EU target. It sounds good. But the NAO says most of the recorded increase in recycling has been due to the UK exporting its waste problem.Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, is already on record saying the UK has got to stop exporting its dirt.Reducing waste and using resources better, as well as  tackling packaging waste is key to that.The environment department Defra estimates that UK packaging recycling rates have increased from 31% in 1998 to 64% in 2017. That beats the EU target of 55%.But since 2002 the quantity of packaging waste exported has increased six-fold, whilst the quantity recycled in the UK has remained the same. What’s more, the figures don’t take into account the risk of undetected fraud and error.The NAO says there’s nothing to prove that packaging sent for recycling actually gets recycled.Nor does Defra have evidence that the system has done what it’s supposed to have done by encouraging companies to minimise their use of packaging or make it easy to recycle.The NAO's report found only 25% of the firms most likely to misbehave over re-processing or exporting waste are inspected, while just 40% of planned compliance visits were actually carried out.An Environment Agency spokesperson, said ""where we find any evidence of fraud or error in data reported to us, we remove that information from the overall packaging recycling data and calculations.""'Tighter grip'But Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said ""a tighter grip on packaging recycling is needed"". “Twenty years ago, the government set up a complex system to subsidise packaging recycling, which appears to have evolved into a comfortable way of meeting targets without addressing the fundamental issues. “The government should have a much better understanding of the difference this system makes and a better handle on the risks associated with so much packaging waste being recycled overseas.""Currently large firms handling over 50 tonnes of packaging a year need to show they have recycled a certain amount of packaging.They do this by paying for a credit note - a Packaging Recovery Note (PRN) - from a recycling firm to contribute to improving recycling.Defra says the scheme raised £50m in 2016. The cash was to be used for ""capacity building"" in the recycling system through increasing collection and processing of recyclables.But critics say the scheme is so opaque it is hard to tell exactly how the money is spent.Local councils, which have to run waste collection and litter services, complain they don’t see a penny of it.A government spokesman says that scheme has increased recycling rates ""significantly"".“However, there is much more to do. We don’t recycle enough waste, and we export too much of it.“That’s why we have already committed to overhaul the system, and we will set out our reforms in the Resources and Waste Strategy later this year.”Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin"
2018-07-23,Brexit deal can be done by October - Raab,https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44913982,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA deal with the EU can be reached by October but the UK is preparing for the possibility of no deal, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has said.He said he would return to Brussels for talks on Thursday and strain ""every sinew"" to get ""the best deal"".But the government had plans in place in case talks did not end well, he told the BBC.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there must be a ""serious stepping up of negotiations"" to avoid no deal.The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019, but the two sides have yet to agree how trade will work between the UK and the EU afterwards.Theresa May hopes the government's plan, detailed recently in the Brexit White Paper, will allow the two sides to reach a deal on relations by the autumn.Downing Street said on Sunday that cabinet ministers would be promoting the plan across Europe over the summer.Theresa May would ""take the lead"" by meeting the Austrian chancellor Czech PM and Estonian PM next week.  Mrs May said: ""We must step up the pace of negotiations and get on to deliver a good deal that will bring greater prosperity and security to both British and European citizens. ""We both know the clock is ticking - let's get on with it.""Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if the ""energy, ambition and pragmatism"" the UK brought to negotiations was reciprocated, a deal would be done in October. He noted that 80% of the withdrawal agreement was already settled.And he said it was ""useful"" that EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had raised questions about the prime minister's blueprint for the UK's future trading relationship with the EU.""The fact Michel Barnier is not blowing it out of the water but asking questions is a good, positive sign - that's what we negotiate on.""  But he said preparations such as hiring extra border staff were being made because ""any responsible government"" would make sure plans were in place in case negotiations failed.Technical notices would be released for businesses and citizens affected during the summer to be ""very clear about what they should do and what we are doing on their behalf"" he added. Asked about European Commission comments that there were no arrangements in place for UK and EU expats in the event of no deal, Mr Raab said: ""Well, I think that's a rather irresponsible thing to be coming from the other side. ""We ought to be trying to reassure citizens on the continent and also here. ""There is obviously an attempt to try and ramp up the pressure.""Analysis by Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent We've heard it often enough: ""No deal is better than a bad deal"".But for EU negotiators to believe the UK would walk away without agreement, the government has to be seen to be taking that option seriously. And so we are told about ""planning"" and ""technical notices"" to prepare for a ""clean break"" Brexit. Reports of food stockpiles and a motorway becoming a lorry park are dismissed as ""unhelpful snippets"" but contingency plans will be made nonetheless.Both sides agree a deal needs to be reached by October, and negotiations are likely to go down to the wire. So even if a deal appears to be in sight, expect the talk of the UK leaving the EU without one to continue.He added that the prospect of people being removed from the UK was ""far-fetched and fanciful"" and said it would be ""frankly irrational"" for the EU to go for the ""worst case scenario"" of no deal. But the UK had to be prepared with things like allocating money, preparing treaty relations, and hiring extra border staff ""so that Britain can thrive, whatever happens,"" he said.Labour leader Mr Corbyn, on a visit to the annual Tolpuddle Martyrs Festival in Dorset, said it seemed the priority was preparation for no deal. He added that would be ""very bad"", as ""we then go onto World Trade Organization tariff rates that would hit the manufacturing industry and hit the food processing industry, and hit an awful lot of things in Britain very rapidly"". ""There has to be a serious stepping-up of negotiations to reach an agreement on customs and on trade.""Earlier, Mr Raab suggested to the Sunday Telegraph that he was still persuading other cabinet ministers that the government's ""pragmatic"" strategy for leaving the EU was the ""best plan"" and that the UK could refuse to pay its so-called divorce bill, a payment from the UK to the EU estimated to be about £39bn, if it does not get a trade deal. Theresa May's proposal for a future trade relationship with the EU sparked two cabinet resignations, including Mr Raab's predecessor David Davis.The White Paper proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but will end free movement and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations.Critics at Westminster say it is an unworkable compromise which would leave the UK being governed by the EU in many areas, but with no say in its rules.And EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier questioned on Friday whether UK plans for a common rulebook for goods and agri-foods were practical and said the EU would not run the risk of weakening its single market.Meanwhile, Mr Davis, whose resignation from Mrs May's top team was followed by that of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, told the Sunday Express the government should ""start again"" on withdrawal plans."

""I was having a confidential private discussion.""He added: ""I do talk to people in other parties."" The Sunday Times reported that Sir Vince missed the vote because he was attending a dinner to discuss the prospects for a new anti-Brexit party.The Lib Dems have been calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.Sir Vince told BBC 5live's Pienaar's Politics: ""The immediate preoccupation is to work with people in other parties to stop Brexit, but in the longer term there may well be realignment because of the deep splits in the parties and I want my party to be at the centre of it.""But he said he would ""absolutely not"" be joining a new party, adding: ""I have got a very good party of my own.""Of the Customs Bill vote on Monday night, he said: ""It was a close vote, it wasn't in itself a big vote but that is not important. We did make a mistake, I made a mistake and won't do that again.""""Party leaders, and indeed many others, spend a lot of time in confidential private conversations and that is what was involved and we got the timing wrong on this occasion.""Mr Farron has also said he had ""called it wrong"". He was booked to give a talk, Illiberal Truths, about the furore during the last general election over whether or not he believed gay sex was a sin.Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael said he had ""messed up"" by allowing both men to skip the vote he had expected to be ""lost by hundreds"".All the party's other MPs - with the exception of Jo Swinson, who is on maternity leave - cast their ballot against the government on amendments to legislation defining the UK's customs arrangements with the EU after it leaves in March 2019.The amendments, tabled by Eurosceptic Tory MPs, were accepted by ministers - prompting a backlash by pro-European Tories, 14 of whom ended up voting against the government.With Labour also voting against, the government scraped home in two votes by a margin of three.Sir Vince said his own absence had been ""overshadowed"" by ""the large scale cheating on pairing arrangements"" - a reference to the row over the Tory chief whip's behaviour in another crunch vote the previous night, on the Trade Bill.

It is unacceptable in our party and in wider society.""But it does not include all of the ""working examples"" given in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism.Following criticism, Labour said it would ""reopen development of the code"" in consultation with Jewish groups.Ms Long-Bailey said the code had been intended to reaffirm Labour's commitment to the the IHRA definition and ""adopt and expand"" upon the examples.She told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""We wanted to develop a code that was legally robust and detailed so that we could enforce it quickly in our disciplinary processes.""But we haven't won the faith of the Jewish community, and indeed my own parliamentary colleagues have expressed concern.""The intention was never to omit parts of the IHRA definition.""She added: ""We recognise the concerns and that's why this week it was right for the NEC to look at the code again and look at consulting with the Jewish community to make sure we get it right, because we have to restore faith in the Jewish community.""Senior Jewish Labour MP Dame Margaret, who lost family members in the Holocaust, last week confronted Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in Parliament over the party's response to anti-Semitism.She later said Mr Corbyn was ""now perceived by many as an anti-Semite"" and faces action under Parliamentary Labour Party procedures requiring MPs to behave in a ""respectful"" way towards colleagues.Ms Hodge has said she chose to ""confront"" Mr Corbyn to express her ""outrage"".Mr Corbyn said on Sunday he had ""felt upset about it but as always I am very calm and treat people with a great deal of respect"".He said there would be further consultation on the code before Labour ""bring it back and get it right"".""I want us to deal with anti-Semitism in our society, as well as all of our parties, including my own.He added: ""What's been done is an honest attempt to make sure that we do make it clear we will not tolerate anti-Semitism in any form and we will allow legitimate debate on issues facing Israel and Palestine, but it cannot ever be conducted in any anti-Semitic form.""Labour's code of conduct was drawn up after the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry. It followed allegations of anti-Semitism within party ranks.The code does reproduce the IHRA's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and lists behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples from that definition:Labour's code says it is ""wrong"" to accuse Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than their own country.And it says that using Nazi comparisons in Israel-Palestine debates ""carries a strong risk of being regarded as prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party"", triggering a disciplinary investigation. Labour backbencher Stella Creasy, told BBC One's Sunday Politics that ""many of us are absolutely despairing"" that Labour had not yet resolved the anti-Semitism row.""I don't think Jeremy Corbyn is an anti-Semite at all but I do think what's happening now requires his leadership,"" she said.""It's really important that we tackle this, that we end this and the way we end this is by adopting those IHRA guidelines."""

2018-07-23,NI abortion reform demanded by politicians,https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44914252,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMore than 170 politicians from the UK and Ireland have signed a letter urging the UK government to reform Northern Ireland's abortion laws.It is the only part of the UK where abortion is illegal unless there is a serious risk to a woman's health.The letter, published in the Sunday Times, says ministers cannot continue to argue that it is a devolved matter.It comes as figures suggest 28 women a week on average go to England from Northern Ireland for an abortion.The unpublished data, obtained by Labour MP Stella Creasy from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service - a charity which provides abortions, suggests that 342 women made the journey between March and May this year.Ms Creasy told the BBC's Sunday Politics that she did not want the women of Northern Ireland to be the ""collateral damage"" of Theresa May needing the DUP to prop up her government.The prime minister relies on Arlene Foster's DUP party - which oppose changes to the abortion laws in Northern Ireland - for her parliamentary majority.The DUP's Sammy Wilson told the BBC it would be babies who would become ""collateral damage"" if changes went ahead.Attention has turned to Northern Ireland after the Republic of Ireland voted overwhelmingly in favour of overturning the country's abortion ban in May.Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland and an abortion is allowed only if a woman's life is at risk or there is a serious or permanent risk to her mental health.Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which an abortion can be performed legally.Last month a majority of Supreme Court judges said those restrictions were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. A United Nations Committee has also said women's rights are being breached.The cross-party letter to Prime Minister Theresa May and her Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar was coordinated by Ms Creasy and signed by 173 parliamentarians from across the UK and Ireland. They include Labour's Harriet Harman and Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, as well as Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald and the party's vice-president Michelle O'Neill.It said the Good Friday Agreement was signed on the understanding that laws would be compliant and called for an ""explicit legislative timetable"" to be set out to decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland.It reads: ""This is a critical step towards ending the treatment of women in Northern Ireland as second-class citizens.""Downing Street has so far said that the issue should be dealt with by the Northern Ireland Assembly, once devolution is restored.The Democratic Unionist Party says it is ""pro-life"" and has campaigned against any extension of abortion rights in Northern Ireland.The DUP's Sammy Wilson said abortion law was a decision for the people in Northern Ireland.However, there has not been an executive at Stormont since the governing parties - the DUP and Sinn Fein - split over a bitter row 18 months ago. This means there are no ministers in place to approve any major decisions.But Mr Wilson said: ""This idea that somehow laws which don't reflect the views of the people of Northern Ireland should be slid under the radar because we don't have an assembly is totally against all of the devolution settlements and certainly against democracy.""Figures from the UK Department of Health show that more than 900 women from Northern Ireland travelled to England for an abortion last year.The number was an increase of more than 25% on the year before and followed a government announcement that women from Northern Ireland would be able to get free abortions in England."
2018-07-23,Call for debate on banning sales of real fur,https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44913186,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA ban on sales of real fur should be considered, a committee of MPs has recommended.The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee investigation into the issue came after some real fur was found wrongly labelled as fake.They described the current labelling of fur products as ""not fit for purpose"".The government said Brexit would allow the UK to ""go further"" when it came to introducing further restrictions on the fur trade.   Fur farming was banned in the UK in 2000, but it is legal to sell some types of real fur that have been imported, if it is accurately labelled.But the Efra committee said retailers and Trading Standards had been complacent about items being incorrectly labelled.Their inquiry came after it emerged High Street and online retailers including TK Maxx, BooHoo, Amazon and Tesco had recently sold real fur as fake. Other retailers found to have passed items off as faux fur included Not on the High Street, Groupon, Etsy, FatFace, Boots, Kurt Geiger and Romwe.  The Efra committee started its investigation in February, when cases of mislabelling came to light via reports from media and campaign groups.The MPs found that while many of the retailers concerned had no-fur policies, the so-called faux fur had actually come from animals including rabbit, fox and chinchilla.It said Brexit could be an opportunity to tighten regulations around the sale of fur and called for a consultation on a bar on the sale of all real fur. ""Many consumers have an ethical reason for not buying garments containing real fur,"" the committee's report said. ""The last few years have shown that there is vulnerability in retailers' supply chains and that real fur has been sold as fake fur. ""Our inquiry has highlighted that the current labelling system is confusing, not fit for purpose and with a high degree of non-compliance. It is also not being enforced."" The committee recognised that fur is ""a subject that raises strong feelings"", adding: ""In looking at whether to ban the sale and import of fur post-Brexit, the government will have to balance the needs of animal welfare against consumer choice.""  Committee chairman Neil Parish said: ""Reports of real fur being sold as fake fur shows that retailers are flouting their responsibility to consumers.""The mis-selling of real fur should not be discovered by campaign organisations and the media, but by Trading Standards officers and retailers.""Retailers of all sizes are complacent about the issue of fake faux fur. It is illegal to give misleading information and Trading Standards have been poor at identifying and acting against those who are doing so."" He recommended that the government should make sure local authorities had the proper resources, and Trading Standards adequate training, to help bring an end to the issue. ""Brexit provides an opportunity to step up our game when it comes to labelling,"" added Mr Parish, Conservative MP for Riverton and Honiton. ""The labelling of clothes must be consistent, transparent and customer-friendly, but current EU requirements are not good enough to allow consumers to understand the origin and contents of their clothing.""The British Fur Trade Association said it welcomed the committee's recommendations on addressing the problems of mis-selling fur and agreed the current European labelling was not fit for purpose.Chief executive Mike Moser said it was vital that consumers were able to make informed decisions, whether they were buying natural or fake fur.He wants to see a fur-specific label introduced on to the UK market which would give greater detail about the type of fur used.However, he said he was disappointed that the committee was recommending a possible trade ban,  despite acknowledging that the fur industry was a legitimate business and wearing fur was a matter of consumer choice.A government statement said: ""The government shares the British public's high regard for animal welfare, and fur farming was banned in the UK in 2000.""Trade in fur from domestic cats, dogs or commercial seal hunts are also banned, but while the UK is a member of the EU it is not possible to introduce additional restrictions on the fur trade.""Brexit gives us the opportunity to go further. Meanwhile, we will closely consider the committee's report and respond in due course.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said real fur sales should be banned.""I think fur products are unnecessary and there is often a great deal of cruelty involved in the production of fur pelts and the synthetic alternatives are much better,"" he said.

2018-07-23,Maastricht battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44924844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNewly released files show how, behind the scenes, John Major decided how to overcome Conservative MPs who voted against the Maastricht treaty in July 1993.Summertime, Conservative civil war over Europe, and Rees-Mogg challenging the prime minister's European plans - but this wasn't Theresa May and Jacob Rees-Mogg but her predecessor, John Major, and his father, William, Lord Rees-Mogg. And the battle was not over Brexit but the Maastricht treaty. This was the agreement that turned the European Community into the European Union (EU) and laid the foundations for the European single currency, the euro.John Major had hailed the treaty, agreed in December 1991 by the then 12 member states, as a good deal for Britain. He praised the opportunities he believed a single market in goods and services, and the free movement of labour, offered. And he believed that a concession, allowing the UK to decide whether, not when, to join a single European currency, was key.Eurosceptic MPs said the treaty would give the EU greater powers at the expense of Westminster. They saw it as a step down the road to a centralised federal EU. And they were implacably opposed the UK joining a single European currency.In the Lords, the former Conservative Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher said that the treaty would ""diminish democracy and increase bureaucracy"".Lord Rees-Mogg went to court to stop the Maastricht treaty from becoming UK law - but judges supported the government's position, on all the issues. ""The outcome was even better than our lawyers had expected,"" Sir Roderic Lyne wrote on a note. He pointed out that Douglas Hurd, then Foreign Secretary, was ""exercising restraint"" in public as he did not want to ""provoke the Rees-Mogg brigade"" into ""further Quixotic action"".John Major enjoyed the moment. ""Good,"" he wrote on the document, ""a full gloat is merited.""Getting the treaty through the Commons took a year. Those who opposed it, from the Labour as well as Conservative benches, were vocal and well organised. But by July 1993 the end of the process was in sight.""It was the toughest time I spent in Downing Street,"" says Sir Roderic, who was John Major's private secretary at the time. ""I remember it as a nightmare.""John Major's strategy as the final vote loomed was a risky one. He would, if needed, call for a motion of confidence. If he had lost, the government would have fallen. It was, in effect, the ""nuclear option"" - either back me or face a general election.On 22 July 1993, after a series of close votes, the government lost the main motion. The ratification of the Maastricht treaty had been blocked.Then, in a moment of the highest political drama, John Major stood up at the dispatch box and announced there would be a vote of confidence in the government the following day, which would also act as a vote to write the treaty into UK law.Seeing all the papers reminds Sir Roderic of how much complex information the prime minister had to digest. ""John Major has an incredibly quick brain"" he says. ""He has a mind like a high-speed computer.""He recalls how on 21 July John Major had been depressed, knowing he had lost the first vote. He tried to work on a speech for the next day but lacked energy and went to bed. ""Everyone expected disaster,"" Sir Roderic says. Yet when he returned to Number 10 first thing next morning, the prime minister was ""perky"".""He had the glint of battle in his eye.""John Major had worked out his plan to call for confidence motion and had held three cabinet meetings to get his ministers to agree.His approach worked - opponents in his own party wouldn't vote against the government in a confidence vote. ""He basically lined the rebels up against a wall and aimed machine guns at them,"" as Sir Roderic puts it.The vote was won, by 339 to 299. John Major and his staff celebrated in his parliamentary office with champagne and congratulations arrived from European politicians. Albert Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, was friendly with Mr Major and sent a message saying: ""Well done.""Now keep your head down and drive on."" Sir Roderic Lyne is reluctant to draw too many parallels between then and now. ""Theresa May is unbelievably resilient I think,"" he says. ""Her problem is far worse than Major. He was attacked by 25 MPs. She's under fire from both right and left. And while for us, the real pressure came in the last stages, she's had it for two years."""
2018-07-23,Week ahead,https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-44904119,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt's the last two days before the summer recess - and the agenda looks pretty light as the parliamentarians coast towards their holiday break, so light, indeed, that the government attempted to cancel this week's sitting altogether. But as readers of this blog will know, the agenda available the week before may not flag up unexpected dramas, and after the turmoil of the last couple of weeks, it is far from impossible that there may be a grand operatic finale to a turbulent couple of months.  One point of interest will be whether the government Chief Whip, Julian Smith, is forced to the dispatch box to make an unprecedented statement about the ""pairing"" row, which has rumbled on since last week's close votes on the customs and trade bills. This may seem a very internal issue, but it's worth remembering that the system of allowing pairing, where one side's MPs don't take part in a vote so that MPs on the other side, with medical issues, don't have to, is a sacrosanct part of Commons life. And - because on less vital votes, it is extended to allow MPs to get away for other reasons - it is one which is vital to MPs quality of life, leaving aside the toxic allegation of cheating. Which is a long winded way of saying there will be hell to pay if it breaks down, because the Opposition decides it can't trust the government to honour those arrangements. Such a breakdown has happened before. In the mid-1970s, when the Labour government of James Callaghan lost its majority, the Conservatives believed that the government whips had broken a pairing arrangement, and cancelled all pairing. The result was the sick and the dying were bussed into the Commons for big votes, with life-shortening consequences. So this is a row the government will be keen to defuse. Apart from that possibility, it looks as if the most interesting action will come in Tuesday's clutch of select committee hearings - where a number of Cabinet ministers are due to give evidence. And watch out for quite a few select committee reports - many inquiries have reached the end of their life-cycle, and swarms of new reports have been emerging. There are plenty more to come. Here's my rundown of a truncated week ahead: The Commons opens (2.30pm) with Housing, Communities and Local Government questions, after which any post-weekend urgent questions or ministerial statements will follow. The day's main business is a general debate on strengthening the union, which will doubtless provide lively exchanges between the SNP and everyone else - and perhaps another of the SNP's cleverly-engineered YouTube moments. And the day will end with an adjournment debate on the societal effect of the drug mamba - a synthetic form of cannabis, formerly sold as a 'legal high' and now illegal.On the committee corridor, the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee has a hearing on Brexit and local government (4.15pm) which looks at  which powers currently held by the EU could be transferred to town halls after the UK's exit.In the Lords (2.30pm) the subjects for questions to ministers include preventing the use of performance-enhancing drugs in junior and amateur sport, and enabling citizens to enter into a same-sex marriage in British Overseas Territories. And the main debate is on preparations and negotiations connected to the UK's exit from the EU - there are  56 peers listed to speak. But it's a general debate in which the expectation is that the usual suspects will make their usual speeches.  It's the last day of term in the Commons (from 11.30am), when the Whips, by tradition, allow MPs to bring in board games. Proceedings open with Health and Social Care questions, providing a dispatch box debut, in his new role for the new Health Secretary, Matthew Hancock - and it will be interesting to see if he makes a break from his predecessor, Jeremy Hunt's, consensual style. A long-time ally of George Osborne, Mr Hancock has a rather similar style, combining hard political strategy with controlled aggression; there are some who wonder if that will work with the NHS.  The Conservative Helen Whately has a Ten Minute Rule Bill on Civil Aviation (Accessibility) - which focuses on the needs of people with disabilities - creating new requirements on parking at airports and other accessibility issues and requiring a named person to be responsible for air passengers with disabilities. Then comes a motion to accept the recommendations of the Committee on Standards report on the DUP MP Ian Paisley which would suspend him from the service of the House for 30 sitting days, beginning Tuesday 4 September.  Mr Paisley apologised to MPs and his constituents for breaching parliamentary rules on paid advocacy, by writing a letter asking the prime minister about a proposed UN resolution concerning Sri Lanka, having received holidays and hospitality from that government. So delicately balanced is the current House of Commons, that even the suspension of one MP could tilt some critical Commons vote in the weeks after the summer recess. Having dealt with that matter, MPs move on to their traditional, and rather amorphous pre-Recess debate, where any MP can speak about any subject. In Westminster Hall debates begin with the Conservative Luke Graham on the remit of the Office of Budget Responsibility (9.30am). He wants to give the OBR, which vets government economic figures and projections, a wider role in examining the full range of legislation and costing it, including the proposals of Opposition parties. That could be interesting from any number of points of view, but it is a role performed by the Congressional Budget Office in the United States, which scores every piece of legislation before the American Congress from both government and opposition. Other debates include: taxpayer liability for safety at the Wylfa Nuclear power project (2.30pm): rail investment in the East Midlands (4pm) and family hubs (4.30pm).It's a surprisingly busy day on the committee corridor, with two new secretaries of state appearing before their select committees - Matt Hancock before Health (2.30pm), and Dominic Raab before the Brexit Committee (2pm). Mr Raab is accompanied by Oliver ""Olly"" Robbins, the prime minister's Europe advisor, a figure high in Brexiteer demonology. The session will focus on recent developments following the publication of the government's White Paper on the future relationship, issues that remain outstanding relating to the withdrawal agreement, and the government's priorities as the October European Council summit approaches. Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs quiz the political savants of the Independent Commission on Referendums, who have been looking at how future referendums should be conducted (10.30am); and the Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling, is before the Transport Committee (2pm) on the subject of the Intercity East Coast rail franchise - their inquiry examines the lessons from previous franchise failures, and the wider implications for the rail franchising system.In the Lords (11am), questions to ministers cover the cost estimate and business case for HS2 Phase One, the implications for the government's domestic abuse strategy of the default payment of universal credit to couples, and the precedents for Parliament providing the government with a mandate for international negotiations. After that, peers rattle through a series of legislative mini-bites: first, the second reading of the Non-Domestic Rating (Nursery Grounds) Bill - a ""tiddler bill"" where the key issue is around restoring the exemption from non-domestic rates for agricultural premises which are nursery grounds and which operate under covered premises. There will also be brief third reading rubber stampings of four private members' bills: the Registration of Marriage Bill, which allows the names of mothers to be recorded on marriage certificates; the Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Bill, which makes such assaults an aggravated offence; the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill, and the Home Education (Duty of Local Authorities) Bill, which aims to tighten up the monitoring of the welfare of children being homeschooled.These are followed by three statutory instrument approval motions: the first on immigration data; followed by two on Higher Education financial support and fees. Final business of the day is a regret motion from Labour's Lord Watson, on information sharing under the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act which criticises the government for selling confidential student data. The final event before the summer (and despite its aim, I would be amazed if it wasn't the final event) is the motion from the Labour peer and arch-Remainer, Lord Adonis, to stop peers rising for their summer recess. He argues that there will be considerable action around the Brexit negotiations and that peers should remain on their red benches to keep tabs on them. He also suggests that voters will wonder where their Parliament is whilst such important events are unfolding.  But I doubt even he expects to convince a majority to abandon their summer holiday.And unless he does, or unless Parliament is recalled, MPs and peers will then depart - returning on Tuesday 4 September. I will post the usual preview towards the end of August. Happy holidays.  "
2018-07-23,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44887513,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe European Union has issued a 16-page document outlining the preparations that need to be made for Brexit. It includes advice on how countries, companies and individuals should prepare for the prospect of the UK leaving with ""no deal"" in place. BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris has read the document so you don't have to. Here are some key excerpts, and explanations of what they mean: From the outset, the EU makes one thing clear - even if negotiations go better than expected, it thinks there will be significant disruption, and everyone needs to be ready for it. (The EU talks about 30 March as exit day, by the way, because the precise time of withdrawal is due to be midnight on 30 March in Central European Time, but 23:00 on 29 March in GMT). The document emphasises that negotiations on a withdrawal agreement are continuing and that a negotiated settlement is the EU's preferred outcome.But it also notes that important issues remain unresolved - including on the protection of personal data sent to the UK while it was a member state and on the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in policing a withdrawal agreement. In particular, it states that there has been ""no progress"" in agreeing a ""backstop"" solution to avoid the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The EU notes, as it has done many times before, that time to both reach and ratify an agreement is running short. This is why preparations for ""no deal"" are so important. If there is a deal, there will also be a transition period running until 31 December 2020 during which EU rules and regulations will continue to apply in the UK. That will give businesses and governments more time to prepare for a new relationship. Without a deal, the transition (or ""implementation period"" as the UK government calls it) falls away and the relationship will change abruptly at the end of March next year. If both sides come to the conclusion several months before the end of March that there will be ""no deal"", they can at least make some contingency plans to deal with that. But if there is a last-minute hitch, time will have run out. So, from the EU's perspective, thinking about ""no deal"" means ""preparing for the worst and hoping for the best"". Much of the UK government would probably look at it in the same way - but there are many Brexiteers who think that ""no deal"" would be perfectly acceptable as long as sufficient preparations have been made.  This kind of language is scattered throughout the document. ""Don't say we didn't warn you,"" would be another way of putting it. The document stresses that some things will have to be done whatever the outcome. One thing it mentions is the need for companies to take steps to ensure that they have the right authorisations and certificates to access the EU market after Brexit. But contingency planning for ""no deal"" is the main emphasis - the EU says this is a prudent step because the outcome of negotiations ""cannot be predicted"". Among other issues, it notes that there would be no arrangement in place for EU citizens in the UK or UK citizens in the EU. It says controls at borders ""could cause significant delays, eg in road transport, and difficulties for ports"", where there could be ""long lines of vehicles waiting for customs procedures to be fulfilled"". It also says that the UK would become a third country for trade and regulatory issues, which would ""represent a significant drawback compared to the current level of market integration"". It also emphasises that while many measures would have to be taken at EU level, national, regional and local governments also need to step up their levels of preparation to ""mitigate the worst impacts of a potential cliff-edge scenario"" - cheerful stuff. And of course a lot of the attention is focused on making sure that individual EU businesses, big and small, are going to be ready for whatever emerges at the end of a highly unpredictable process of negotiation. The document notes that several EU governments, such as the Irish and the Dutch, have set up online platforms to help their companies prepare for different potential Brexit scenarios. The document also claims - in a sentence that won't please the UK government - that ""many companies are relocating to the EU27"" or expanding their operations there. EU officials insist that they are not trying to add fuel to the fire and that they are simply engaged in prudent planning. But it's a reminder that there are people in Europe, as well as in the UK, who see Brexit as an opportunity rather than a threat. The commission has now published 68 notices (anyone with a few hours to spare can read them here) on preparations in specific sectors of the economy, including health and food safety, financial services, customs, transport, and company law. They set out the legal and technical issues that governments and companies need to take into account and are another glimpse into the complexities of Brexit that stretch into every area of economic life.  In the UK, the government has not yet published any comparable information of its own.However, on Wednesday, Theresa May told MPs at the Liaison Committee that a similar number of technical notifications about what to do in the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit will be released during August and September - aimed at businesses and citizens.In response to the EU document, the Department for Exiting the European Union said ""It is the duty of any responsible government to prepare for every eventuality, including the unlikely scenario that we reach March 2019 without agreeing a deal. We have already done a lot of work behind the scenes to prepare for this - it is only natural that our European partners would seek to make similar preparations. We are keen to work closely with the EU on preparedness issues.""There are all sorts of EU databases, including many dealing with policing and internal security issues, to which the UK wants to retain access after Brexit. But the EU has argued that the UK can't simply pick and choose the bits of membership it likes - and this part of the document emphasises that work is well under way to remove the UK from numerous databases and IT systems once it becomes a ""third country"". The commission is also making preparations for changing international agreements that currently involve the UK as a member state. It says it will notify its international partners formally once it has sufficient certainty about the outcome of the current negotiations - not for a while, then. Finally, the EU document says work is under way to relocate or reassign tasks that are currently performed in the UK - such as the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre (part of the EU's project for satellites in space) or the UK-based EU Reference Laboratories - because it will not be possible ""to entrust a third country"" with such EU tasks after the withdrawal date. Two London-based agencies, the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority, are already moving to Amsterdam and Paris respectively. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-07-23,Who's getting in?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44871559,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFiles just released show how in 1988 Denis Thatcher personally vetted the guest list for a showbiz reception at Number 10, providing an insight into the thoughts of one of the most taciturn of prime ministerial consorts.On 7 June 1987, just days before the general election, the Conservatives held a rally in Wembley. On the stage with the prime minister were 45 celebrities, rounded up by the entrepreneur and Conservative fundraiser Sir Basil Feldman. They included some of the biggest names in TV at the time, including Ronnie Corbett, Jimmy Tarbuck, Bob Monkhouse and Shirley Bassey.Mrs Thatcher won, of course, and a few months later decided to give a party to thank her showbiz supporters. Forty-five guests would not fill up the grand reception rooms at Number 10 Downing Street, so the list, now revealed by the Thatcher Archive, was expanded. John Whittingdale, then Mrs Thatcher's political secretary, suggested Paul McCartney, Cliff Richard, Freddie Mercury and Mick Jagger as guests. The first two made the list, drawn up by the ministry for the arts: government ministers were added, as were civil list pensioners and sportsmen and women.This guest list, which contained 229 names, not including spouses, was copied by Mrs Thatcher's private office to Denis Thatcher, who was to co-host the party.He wrote back: ""Whilst I accept of course that not everyone who comes to our receptions are necessarily on our side I find it both unpleasant and embarrassing to entertain those who publicly insult the PM. ""This list therefore needs some careful checking in this regard.""He went through it with a red pen, ticking ""those who I would personally like to see included"" and putting a question mark by ""those who I believe do NOT help"". He added that more than one tick ""means super person and a known friend and wonderful to have them here"".Top of his list was the comic and actor Eric Sykes, who got four ticks by his name. The golfer Peter Alliss got three -  Ronnie Corbett got two ticks, as did Penelope Keith, Judith Chalmers, Tim Rice and others. More intriguing are his question marks. The artists Gilbert and George, described as ""image makers"", got two. Single question marks went to Jan Leeming, Paul Daniels and Shirley Bassey, who'd been at the Wembley rally, Paul McCartney and, oddest of all, David Attenborough.Richard Ingrams, who for many years wrote the Dear Bill letters in Private Eye magazine, purporting to be the private correspondence of Denis Thatcher to a golfing friend, has his own theory about the ticks and crosses.""One of the few things we know about Denis is that he had a very low opinion of the BBC. He thought that BBC people were all pinkos."" That might explain why Sir David got a question mark - or perhaps Denis mixed up his Attenboroughs. David's brother, the actor and director Richard, was a longstanding Labour supporter.""It's very unusual to have Denis interfering,"" Mr Ingrams adds.""Denis loved his wife and wanted to protect her, and kept out of the limelight himself. He used to say a whale only gets shot if it spouts.""Chris Collins, director of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation and editor of its vast archive website, agrees it was ""unusual"" for Denis Thatcher to involve himself to this extent. The reason, he adds, may be an earlier episode in which Mrs Thatcher considered suing BBC Radio 4's Today programme for libel over a satirical entry in a short-story competition, entitled Thatcherism: The Final Solution, which aired in January 1988.Mr Thatcher wrote a personal letter of complaint to the BBC's then chairman Marmaduke Hussey, saying that never had ""so foul a libel been published against anyone, let alone a prime minister"".Mr Collins adds that: ""The special coded system of question marks and ticks and crosses, that's actually slightly unusual.""Certainly the steam is coming out of his ears at various points in 1988 and this party he jumps on.""The final guest list included only the original 45 names, plus the 1988 British Winter Olympics team - and the parliamentary skiing team. Eddie ""the Eagle"" Edwards, whose efforts at that winter's Games had won him admirers around the world, wasn't there: he had a prior charity engagement.Richard Ingrams never met Denis Thatcher when he was writing Dear Bill, but he did later invite him to a lunch for the Oldie magazine, which Mr Ingrams founded and edited. After that, he came, as a paying punter, to literary lunches, always sending a handwritten ""thank you"" card.""And so that's quite funny, that for this party he comes down hard on people who've written unfavourably about The Boss [Margaret Thatcher], that he chose to fraternise with me! Albeit once her political career was over.""And did they ever talk about the Dear Bill letters? ""No, he never mentioned them. But maybe he thought that was just being polite.""Could Philip May ever play the same role? Richard Ingrams thinks not. ""He's playing the Denis role of keeping his trap shut. We know very little about Philip May. But Mrs May doesn't really measure up to Thatcher.""Members of the public will be able to browse through the archive from Monday 23 July by visiting www.margaretthatcher.org."

2018-07-23,Profile: Ian Paisley,https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44885043,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIan Paisley's sanction for breaking parliamentary rules, which could see him suspended from the House of Commons for 30 days, is the latest chapter in a political career that has combined controversy with huge popularity at the ballot box.The youngest child of Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) founder Ian Paisley, Ian Paisley Jr entered elected politics in 1996 and took over as MP for his father's former North Antrim constituency in 2010.But controversy - whether surrounding his views on homosexuality or allegations of lobbying on a £50m government land deal - has never been far away.If he is suspended from the Commons for failing to declare the details of two family holidays in 2013 - paid for by the Sri Lankan government - it could deprive Theresa May's government of a crucial vote in crunch Brexit debates.Mr Paisley and his nine DUP colleagues in Westminster found themselves cast as kingmakers after the Conservative party fell short of a majority in the 2017 general election, which led to a confidence-and-supply deal between the two parties.The youngest of five children, Mr Paisley's interest in unionist politics was evident long before his election to the Northern Ireland Forum in 1996.After attending Shaftesbury House College and Methodist College Belfast, he studied modern history and Irish politics at Queen's University Belfast.During his time as a student, he made a very public demonstration against the dropping of God Save the Queen from graduation ceremonies.He and Peter Weir, now a DUP colleague, stood during the ceremony and played the British national anthem on a small tape recorder.ResignationIn 1998, he was elected to the new Northern Ireland Assembly, easing home on the second count behind his father, who topped the poll.In 2007, on the same day his father became first minister of Northern Ireland, he was appointed a junior minister in the devolved administration.But he served less than a year in the post before resigning, following criticism of his links to developer Seymour Sweeney, on whose behalf he allegedly lobbied over a £50m government land deal in his constituency.An ombudsman ruled there was no evidence to suggest he had broken assembly rules, but he stepped down, saying: ""The criticism has been a distraction and has got in the way of the activities of this government and importantly it has gotten in the way of the activities of my political party.""Mr Paisley's personal views have been the subject of criticism, particularly his opinions on homosexuality.In 2005 he was formally censured by the Northern Ireland Policing Board for describing homosexual relationships as ""immoral, offensive and obnoxious.""Two years later, he was accused by Sinn Féin of ""dangerous homophobia"" after being quoted in Ireland's Hot Press magazine as saying: ""I am pretty repulsed by gay and lesbianism. I think it is wrong.""In 2011, Mr Paisley said his views had changed: He told The House magazine that he had ""grown up"" since those comments.""I have huge respect for people no matter what their religious and social background,"" he said.""I think I have grown up since then. I have strong Christian beliefs and moral viewpoints, but you have to realise that while sin is black and white, life is a lot of grey.""He also faced criticism after saying police officers should ""shoot dissident republicans on sight"", later adding that officers ""should have the opportunity to employ lethal force against those who would seek to kill them.""But the controversies have done nothing to damage his popularity with voters in North Antrim. In 2010, he was elected as the MP for the constituency and has been re-elected twice since then. At the 2017 general election he cruised to victory with 59% of the vote.Following his censure over failing to declare details of his Sri Lankan holidays, many constituents told the BBC they remained supportive of the father-of-four, who has been married to paediatric nurse Fiona since 1990.Along with a passion for motorbikes, he lists his interests in Who's Who as his children, Chinese food, cinema and rugby.Despite being the son of the DUP's founder, Mr Paisley has not felt constrained to toe the party line on all occasions. When former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness retired in January 2017, Mr Paisley's tributes were notably warmer than many other unionist politicians.He told BBC NI's The View programme he wanted to thank former IRA commander Mr McGuinness, who struck a historic power-sharing deal with his father in 2007.His profile was raised after last year's DUP-Conservative deal, and he has been a strong supporter of Brexit, and US President Donald Trump.During the annual St Patrick's Day celebrations at the White House, Mr Paisley tweeted that he was the ""only person from NI to be invited to a private family reception"".He also invited Mr Trump to visit Northern Ireland and posted a selfie with First Lady Melania Trump on Twitter. Mr Paisley's interaction with another famous Twitter user saw him come under fire: He apologised after retweeting a comment by right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins, which read: ""March 2018. London has a higher murder rate than New York... and Ramadan's not yet begun.""He later deleted the comment and apologised, saying he had ""did not take cognisance of Ramadan reference"".That apology was followed on Thursday by an emotional statement in the House of Commons in which he admitted a ""deep personal embarrassment"" following the Sri Lankan holiday rule breach.He could now face a by-election for his seat in North Antrim, where his popularity with voters, undimmed until now, would be tested in different circumstances.

2018-07-23,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-23,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180724031116/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

2018-07-24,May takes control of Brexit negotiations,https://web.archive.org//web/20180725054241/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44941792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May is taking personal control of Brexit talks with the EU, with Dominic Raab deputising for her.Mr Raab was drafted in as Brexit Secretary to replace David Davis, who quit in protest at the prime minister's proposals for post-Brexit trade.A special unit in Mrs May's office has played an increasing role in Brexit talks during recent months.Tuesday's announcement, in a written statement by Mrs May, formalises that shift in responsibility.Labour's Shadow Brexit Minister Jenny Chapman said: ""Dominic Raab has been sidelined by the prime minister before he has even had the chance to get his feet under the table.""Mr Raab, who was a leading figure in the Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, insisted he had not been sidelined, telling MPs it had always been the case that Mrs May was in overall charge of the talks and the announcement amounted to some ""shifting of the Whitehall deckchairs"".He said the prime minister had suggested the changes to him on the day he was offered David Davis's job and he had agreed to them.He acknowledged there had previously been ""tensions"" between his department and the Cabinet Office and the changes would ensure there was ""one chain of command"" to ""get the best possible deal"". Stewart Jackson, who was chief of staff for David Davis before he resigned two weeks ago, has previously accused Number 10 of running a ""shadow, parallel operation"" and keeping officials and ministers from the Brexit department ""in the dark"" about Brexit proposals.The Europe Unit led by senior civil servant Olly Robbins in the Cabinet Office, which reports directly to the prime minister, will have ""overall responsibility for the preparation and conduct of the negotiations"", Mrs May said in her written statement. ""DExEU (the Department for Exiting the EU) will continue to lead on all of the government's preparations for Brexit: domestic preparations in both a deal and a no-deal scenario, all of the necessary legislation, and preparations for the negotiations to implement the detail of the Future Framework.""I will lead the negotiations with the European Union, with the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union deputising on my behalf.""Mrs May said that DExEU would recruit some new staff to work on preparations for Brexit, while a number of Cabinet Office officials would move over to the department.There will be no net reduction to staff numbers in Mr Raab's department, she said.Mr Raab told MPs on the Brexit committee, he would be going back out to Brussels shortly to continue talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier, alongside Mr Robbins. Conservative MP Craig Mackinlay suggested a ""coup"" had taken place to take control of the Brexit process away from David Davis.Mr Robbins said: ""I honestly don't recognise the picture you are painting.""It comes as the government published a White Paper saying how the UK's EU withdrawal agreement will be put into law.Mr Raab said the proposed Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill would deliver a ""smooth and orderly"" Brexit.He said it would kick in only once MPs had given their backing to any deal struck with Brussels in the autumn. If there is no deal it will not be enacted.The legislation would amend some parts of the EU Withdrawal Bill, passed last month after a series of knife-edge votes, to ensure the UK statute book continues to function during the 21 month transition period.It would not end the supremacy of EU law altogether on 29 March next year, as promised in the EU Withdrawal Bill, with the continued jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice until December 2020, among other things.Labour's Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it was now clear that the EU Withdrawal Act ""will need major surgery,"" adding that the 29 March Brexit day was a ""gimmick"" which had come ""unstuck"".""I can't remember legislation which has needed such great revision and amendment before the relevant parts have even come into force,"" he told MPs. The new bill would create a financial authority to manage ""divorce"" payments, which will total between £35bn and £39bn, to the EU - and aim to protect citizens' rights.Mr Raab told MPs: ""It provides the clarity and certainty to EU citizens living here and UK nationals abroad that their rights will be properly protected. ""It will enact a time-limited implementation period, giving businesses greater certainty, giving the public finality with respect to our relationship with the EU and it provides for the appropriate means for paying the financial settlement. ""Above all, with 80% of the withdrawal agreement settled with our EU friends, the white paper is another key milestone on the UK's path to leaving the EU.""He said the publication of the white paper will allow ""maximum scrutiny"" of the government's plans by Parliament.""It also sends a clear signal to the European Union that the United Kingdom is a reliable, dependable negotiating partner, delivering on the commitments it has made across the negotiation table,"" he told MPs.In a separate development, the UK government guaranteed funding for EU programmes run by UK charities, businesses and universities up to the end of 2020, even if the UK left without a deal."
2018-07-24,NHS to stockpile drugs for no deal Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180725054241/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44946819,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe NHS in England is preparing to stockpile medicines and blood products in case of a ""no deal"" Brexit, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.He said he was confident a deal would be reached but it was ""responsible"" to prepare for all outcomes.He told the Health Select Committee he had met medical industry leaders to ""accelerate"" preparations since taking over as health secretary two weeks ago.The government is stepping up planning for a ""no deal"" Brexit.But ministers have so far rejected talk of shortages and queues of lorries at ports if the EU and UK can not reach a deal by March next year, when the UK officially leaves the bloc.  Both the government and the EU have insisted they want to avoid a ""no deal"" Brexit but key differences remain as they enter the critical phase of talks. The UK is sticking by its insistence that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"".Mr Hancock said: ""We are working right across government to ensure that the health sector and the industry are prepared and that people's health will be safeguarded in the event of a no-deal Brexit.""This includes the chain of medical supplies, vaccines, medical devices, clinical consumables, blood products.""And I have asked the department to work up options for stockpiling by industry.""We are working with industry for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a no-deal Brexit.""The health and social care secretary said such planning carried a ""cost implication"".""We are also focusing on the importance of a continuous supply of medicines that have a short shelf life - so some of the medicines most difficult to provide in a no-deal scenario where there is difficult access through ports will need to be flown in.""I hope that even under a no-deal scenario that there will still be smooth movement in through ports.""He said the government would also be setting out ""contingency plans"" for people booking holidays in EU countries who might need medical insurance in the event of a no deal scenario.Labour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said: ""We need a Brexit deal which puts patients first but now we know that the NHS is having to stockpile medicines because of this government's chaotic handling of Brexit.""This is the terrifying reality of this government's failure to prioritise the NHS in the Brexit negotiations.""Simon Stevens, NHS England's chief executive, said earlier this month that ""extensive"" planning for a no deal Brexit was under way, around the supply of medicines and equipment.Government departments are planning to issue guidance to businesses and consumers over the summer break on how to cope with a no deal Brexit.Brexit Minister Lord Callanan dismissed claims there were plans to stockpile food.""I am not aware of any plans for stockpiling food. It seems to me to be a fairly ridiculous scare story,"" he told the House of Lords.""There are many countries outside of the European Union that manage to feed their citizens perfectly satisfactorily without the benefit of EU processes.""Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab told MPs the government would take steps to ensure an ""adequate food supply""."

""A lack of support for manufacturing industry is sucking the dynamism out of our economy, pay from the pockets of our workers and any hope of secure, well-paid jobs from a generation of young people.""He added: ""Labour is determined to see public contracts provide public benefit, using our money to nurture and grow our industries, our people and to expand our tax base.""Mr Corbyn said Labour would intervene to bring quality jobs to all regions, saying that his party would opt out of parts of world trade rules if necessary to ensure jobs went to local people, rather than sit back ""and manage decline"".On Brexit, Mr Corbyn said the fall in the value of the pound as a result of Brexit had not provided the benefits to exporters it should have, because the Conservatives had ""sold out"" manufacturers.He said the prime minister ""and her warring Cabinet should think again, even at this late stage, and reconsider the option of negotiating a brand new customs union"".""This decision doesn't need to be a matter of ideology... it ought to be a matter of practical common sense.""Otherwise a ""botched"" Brexit ""will sell our manufacturers short with the fantasy of a free trading buccaneering future, which in reality would be a nightmare of our public services sold to multinational companies and our country in hock to Donald Trump, while we are all told to eat chlorinated chicken.""For the Conservatives, Robert Jenrick, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: ""This is laughable coming from the Labour Party who oversaw millions of jobs lost and a record decline in manufacturing.""We know from last time Labour don't know how to handle the economy and now their plan would mean higher prices for families and lower wages for workers. ""Under the Conservatives, exports are up, there's more business investment, more manufacturing jobs and employment is at a record high - meaning more people have the security of a regular pay packet.""The Lib Dems Brexit spokesman Tom Brake accused Mr Corbyn of living in a world of ""alternative facts"" by talking about the benefits of Brexit, adding he was ""laying the path for the Tories' chaotic Brexit"".Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, called Mr Corbyn's plans ""protectionism"".He said: ""For all the criticism of America's current approach to trade in this speech, the proposals of subsidies and 'buying British' are just as protectionist as tariffs.""Britain has many fantastic manufacturing firms, but the fetishisation of factories and production lines over all other parts of the economy is misguided. We should not be ashamed of our world-class creative, digital and professional services."""
2018-07-24,Brexit donor paid money to Lesotho minister,https://web.archive.org//web/20180725054241/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44939665,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowArron Banks paid thousands of pounds into a government minister's private bank account while seeking a licence to prospect for diamonds in the Kingdom of Lesotho, it has emerged. The tycoon acknowledges he gave money to the politician but says it was to help fund his political campaigning. Mr Banks, the Brexit campaign's biggest funder, denies corruption.An anti-corruption investigator is now probing the alleged link in light of evidence gathered by the BBC.Paul O'Sullivan, who has the authority to file a criminal case with the prosecutor, said there was a ""serious lack of transparency"". The evidence discovered by the BBC focuses on the relationship Mr Banks had with the leader of the Basotho National Party (BNP), Thesele Maseribane.Mr Maseribane - who is also a government minister - admitted that Mr Banks, the Bristol-based businessman, transferred £65,000 into his personal bank account in South Africa.He defended the transaction, saying: ""Lesotho is overcome with corruption. I'm not saying my party is, but what I'm saying is we should try and practise a very fair policy.""Not only did Mr Banks transfer money to the party leader in 2013, he also covered the costs of campaign rallies, spending £350,000.At around the same time, Mr Banks was seeking a prospecting licence for his mining site along the Senqu River in the south of Lesotho. He also financially supported Mr Maseribane whilst he was in exile following a military coup in 2014, paying for his accommodation and food. When the BBC visited the Senqu River site, its manager Dirk Veldtman said it was now closing because of a lack of diamonds. In fact, only six diamonds were found in three years, at an estimated value of £28,000. He said it was very difficult to secure mining permits and that it helped to ""grease palms"" of various government officials.Email excerpts seen by the BBC show that several weeks after £16,000 was transferred into Mr Maseribane's account, Mr Banks' application for a prospecting licence was approved in 2014.The BBC showed these interviews to Mr O'Sullivan, a high-profile anti-corruption investigator based in South Africa.He said: ""If you are paying the rent, buying food, and financially supporting politicians who could influence and further your own business interests, then there are clear signs of corruption at play.""Putting money into the private bank account of a government minister also raises questions. There is a serious lack of transparency.""I will be filing a docket, a criminal complaint here in South Africa and I will be sending a file to the Serious Fraud Office in the UK.""Mr Banks admitted financing Mr Maseribane, but denied that this amounted to corruption.He said it was necessary to ""grease palms"" in Lesotho to get things done through government, but denied ever having done that. He said his company had made four applications for mining licences, all of which are outstanding. However, he did not deny that Mr Maseribane had spoken to the mining minister on his behalf and that a prospecting licence had been granted in 2014.   "

He said he was ""unable to speak in the House with confidence until now"" and described how he was the ""very first autistic MP, as well as having cerebral palsy and other disabilities"".Mr O'Mara said he was ""very proud"" of Sheffield, after paying tribute to former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Nick Clegg and praising the city's sports stars.He added he is returning to parliament in September with ""an unwavering commitment to social justice"".Mr O'Mara was suspended from the Labour Party in October over alleged homophobic and misogynistic comments. He was reinstated on 3 July following an investigation but resigned days later."
2018-07-24,Gove: Tariff-free food trade 'likely',https://web.archive.org//web/20180725054241/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-44938756,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTariff-free access to European food markets is ""overwhelmingly"" likely after Brexit, Environment Secretary Michael Gove believes.""I think because a deal is in all our interests, that is what the outcome will be,"" he told BBC Wales.On a visit to the Royal Welsh Show, Mr Gove said the EU had been constructive.He added that its chief negotiator Michel Barnier did not want any trade barriers, quotas or tariffs ""which was good news for Welsh farmers"".But he said that the UK was still preparing for all eventualities, including a no deal Brexit scenario, which was prudent.Jeremy Hunt warns of no deal 'by accident'What would a no deal Brexit look like?'We can get a deal done by October' - RaabAsked what would happen on day one if there was no deal, he replied: ""Well, we will get that deal and I'm confident that food and farming not just in Wales but across the UK will benefit from a win-win situation whereby we both manage to secure tariff-free access to European markets and at the same time we're outside the bureaucracy of the Common Agricultural Policy.""On Monday, Meat Promotion Wales' chairman, Kevin Roberts, warned that tariffs at any level would be ""unthinkable"" and a no deal Brexit would be ""catastrophic"".Mr Gove's counterpart in Wales, Lesley Griffiths, also warned that ""if you crash out, you can only imagine the chaos that will ensue"". But speaking at the show in Llanelwedd, Powys on Tuesday, Mr Gove said that farmers in Wales and across the UK would have ""everything they need"" after Brexit and an ""absolute guarantee"" that spending in cash terms would be protected until 2022.""That's more of a guarantee of funding for farmers across the United Kingdom than any other European country is able to give its farmers,"" he added.He said the funding would also not be via the Barnett formula - the calculation for transferring funding to the Welsh Government. Meat inspectors shortage 'crisis' blamed on BrexitDream summer for ice cream makers - but what about farmers?No deal 'would be seismic shock' for farmersMr Gove said the message to farmers was ""we've got your back, we're right behind you"" and that there was a ""brilliant future"" ahead.""We've been clearer than other European countries about the future level of funding, we've also been clearer about the nature of the trade arrangements we want to see, clearer about how that money will be spent so farmers can get the certainty they need so they can be more productive and clearer about the environmental benefits we want to secure as well,"" he added."
2018-07-24,Biggest pay rise in decade for 1m workers,https://web.archive.org//web/20180725054241/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44933009,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA million public sector workers are to receive their biggest pay rise in nearly 10 years, the government says.It includes 2.9% extra this year for the armed forces, 2.75% for prison officers and up to 3.5% for teachers. Police will see a 2% rise, the same increase seen by GPs and dentists. The move confirms the scrapping of the 1% pay cap last year and follows campaigns by unions for higher wage rises.The government said the increases were affordable within its spending plans. Individual departments are having to fund the pay rises, rather than the money coming from the Treasury.   The pay rises for doctors and dentists only apply to England, while the pay rises for prison officers, teachers, and police officers apply to England and Wales.The armed forces pay offer is for the whole of the UK. Details of the announcement include: In June the bulk of NHS staff in Scotland were offered a 9% pay rise spread across three years.A 3% pay offer to teachers in Scotland was rejected by the unions earlier in the year.Comparing public and private sector pay is tricky because public sector workers are on average better qualified and many lower-paid jobs such as cleaning and security have been outsourced from the public sector to the private.If you look at what has happened to growth in pay since 2010, private sector pay has been growing faster, due to the effect of two years of public sector pay freezes starting in 2011, followed by 1% caps.But both public and private sector workers have seen their average pay rising more slowly than prices. The comparison between public and private sector pay also ignores pension provision, which tends to be better in the public sector, and bonus payments, which are more common in the private sector but excluded from these average earnings figures.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""By increasing the pay levels, albeit by less than the rate of inflation, that can only be paid for by cuts within the public services.""And so, if it's local authorities or anybody else, they're going to have to pay for it by either removing their balances, which they shouldn't be doing, or by cutting services further."" The cost of scrapping the 1% cap is estimated at £4bn.The move has been seen as a bid to boost staff recruitment and retention as well as improve morale in the public sector. Unions have been arguing for pay rises closer to 5% to make up for the austerity measures introduced by David Cameron's government eight years ago.Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said the announcement was ""fantastic news just before the summer for a million workers right across the public sector"". She said: ""We hugely value the work that people do, whether it's teachers, soldiers or police officers."" But Prospect union deputy general secretary Garry Graham said: ""Today's pay deals for the armed forces, prison workers and teachers are welcome but confirm what we have long suspected, this government have put civil servants firmly at the back of the queue on public sector pay.""Instead of playing cynical divide-and-rule games with overworked and underpaid public sector workers, the government should be committing to above-inflation pay rises for all public servants, with no group left behind.""

A source confirmed the delay to what was trailed as ""the most substantial report of its kind for a generation"".The then Communities Secretary Sajid Javid announced last year it would be a ""wide-ranging, top-to-bottom review"". Labour's John Healey said ministers had now ""missed their own deadline"".The shadow housing secretary said ministers had pledged to publish the social housing policy paper by the time MPs broke up for their summer recess.""After eight years of failure, this government can't even get its act together to publish a policy paper, never mind fix the country's housing problems,"" Mr Healey said.A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokeswoman said: ""Since the Grenfell Tower tragedy we have been listening to residents and those across the social housing sector. ""Providing high quality and well managed social housing is a top priority for this government.""Shortly we will publish a Green Paper that sets out a new deal for social housing tenants.""The policy paper is now expected to be published within the next few weeks."
2018-07-24,UK snooping 'unlawful for more than decade',https://web.archive.org//web/20180725054241/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44936592,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe system that allowed spy agency GCHQ access to vast amounts of personal data from telecoms companies was unlawful for more than a decade, a surveillance watchdog has ruled.The Investigatory Powers Tribunal said that successive foreign secretaries had delegated powers without oversight.But it added there was no evidence GCHQ had misused the system.Privacy International criticised the ""cavalier manner"" in which personal data was shared.The group brought the legal challenge and solicitor Millie Graham Wood said it was ""proof positive"" that the system set up to protect personal data was flawed.""The foreign secretary was supposed to protect access to our data by personally authorising what is necessary and proportionate for telecommunications companies to provide to the agencies.""The way that these directions were drafted risked nullifying that safeguard by delegating that power to GCHQ - a violation that went undetected by the system of commissioners for years and was seemingly consented to by all of the telecommunications companies affected.""Under security rules introduced after the attacks on 11 September 2001, the UK's foreign secretary had the power to direct GCHQ to obtain data from telecoms companies, with little oversight of what they were subsequently asking for.The Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) - set up to investigate complaints about how personal data is handled by public bodies - ruled that most of the directions given between 2001 and 2012 had been unlawful.The tribunal was critical of the way the government handed on requests to GCHQ, partly because phone and internet providers ""would not be in any position to question the scope of the requirement"" because they ""would have no knowledge of the limited basis upon which the direction had been made"".""In form, the general direction was a carte blanche. In practice, it was not treated as such and there is no evidence that GCHQ ever sought to obtain communications data which fell outside the scope of data which had been sought in the submission to the foreign secretary,"" the IPT ruled.It added that a series of improvements had been made and were in force ""from at least 2014"" that ensured ""great care"" was now taken to ensure the foreign secretary approved any changes to the information being demanded from telecoms companies.A government spokesman said: ""We welcome today's judgment that the security and intelligence agencies' powers are proportionate and comply with the European Convention on Human Rights.""The security and intelligence agencies are subject to a strict legal framework and robust independent oversight. ""We are proud of the work they do to keep the UK safe within these parameters."""
2018-07-24,MPs vote to suspend Paisley for 30 days,https://web.archive.org//web/20180725054241/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-44932312,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs have voted to suspend DUP MP Ian Paisley for 30 sitting days.It follows his failure to declare two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government.  He will be absent from Parliament for some key Brexit votes.He has also been suspended by the DUP ""pending further investigation into his conduct"".Speaker of the House John Bercow called it ""a regrettable state of affairs"".Mr Bercow will now formally inform the chief electoral officer of the decision and she has ten working days to set up a petition which, if signed by 10% of North Antrim constituents, will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley having to stand down. The Recall of MPs Bill became law in 2015 under the coalition government. Sir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, said they had concluded Mr Paisley was guilty of ""serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute"".He also said the inquiry into Mr Paisley could have been concluded earlier: ""The process could have been considerably shorter if Mr Paisley had been more cooperative initially."" Sir Kevin said Mr Paisley did show a ""greater sense of urgency"" in the later stages of the investigation.This is one of the longest bans ever to be handed down at Westminster. According to the House of Commons library, it is the longest suspension since 1949 which is as far as online records go.Analysis by political correspondent Gareth GordonSuspended by fellow MPs, and now the party his late father once ruled without dissent, these are difficult days for Ian Paisley Jnr.It's not the first time he's fallen foul of the DUP leadership but this is by far the most serious.He's made it clear he intends to fight any subsequent by-election. But what will the DUP leadership do?Some would undoubtedly like to say farewell to him for good.But... first of all he's a Paisley.Secondly, he's popular with the unionists of North Antrim who may not forgive the party if it cast him permanently aside.The DUP had to do something and they've done it. But the smart money says that after a period of suspension, Ian Paisley will still be the DUP candidate should North Antrim go to the polls before the end of the year.Mr Paisley has insisted he will fight any by-election to save his Westminster seat if he is forced to stand down.Mr Paisley's party plays a pivotal role in supporting Theresa May's minority government.In June 2017, an agreement was reached that the 10 DUP MPs would back the Tories in key Commons votes.Writing in the Ballymena Guardian on Tuesday, the North Antrim MP said he was prepared for whatever punishment came his way.He called those pushing for such an election ""opportunists"", but made it clear that he would not run away from any challenge.The Officers of the Democratic Unionist Party have considered the report of the House of Commons Committee on Standards on Ian Paisley MP.The Party takes this report and the matters contained within it very seriously. The Party Officers have decided to suspend Mr Ian Paisley MP from membership of the Party pending further investigation into his conduct. The Party does not intend to make any further comment on these matters during the course of the above outlined process.Mr Paisley failed to declare two luxury family holidays in 2013 paid for by the Sri Lankan government. He later lobbied the then prime minister on the country's behalf.Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Stephen Nolan Show on Wednesday, the political editor of the News Letter, Sam McBride, described the scale of the punishment as ""new territory"" for the House of Commons.   ""This is not some minor breach of parliamentary protocol - this is something that parliament frowns upon in such a way that under this new law, they now give voters in his constituency the chance to remove him from his seat so it's very different to what has gone before."" Although the DUP said party officers took the decision to suspend Mr Paisley, Mr McBride said he believed the leader of the party, Arlene Foster, would have approved it.

2018-07-24,Judges urged to strike down Brexit bill,https://web.archive.org//web/20180725054241/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44923384,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHolyrood's Brexit bill is ""fundamentally inconsistent"" with UK law and should not be allowed to stand, judges at the Supreme Court have heard.The court is hearing arguments about whether the Brexit legislation passed by MSPs should be allowed to stand.UK law officer Lord Keen said the Scottish legislation would ""undermine"" Westminster's EU Withdrawal Bill.But Scotland's Lord Advocate insists that the bill is within Holyrood's remit and should become law.The hearing will continue on Wednesday, and a judgement is not expected until later in the year.The Welsh and Northern Irish assemblies will also be represented in the two-day hearing, having made submissions backing the Scottish government's stance.The UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Legal Continuity) (Scotland) Bill - known as the ""continuity bill"" - was passed under emergency procedures with only the Conservatives and a single Lib Dem MSP voting against it.It was drafted as an alternative to Westminster's EU Withdrawal Bill, which MSPs refused to give their consent to following a row over how powers currently exercised from Brussels will be used after Brexit.But before it could become law, it was referred to the Supreme Court by UK law officers to settle whether it lies within Holyrood's competence.Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh penned an official memo saying the bill was ""not within the legislative competence of the parliament"", as it would see MSPs ""make provision now for the exercise of powers which is it is possible they will acquire in future"".This was denied by Lord Advocate James Wolffe, the Scottish government's top legal adviser, who insisted the legislation was ""carefully framed"" not to cut across EU laws - and said it was designed on the Withdrawal Bill in that regard.The UK government's senior law officers said they wanted the Supreme Court to look at the bill to ensure there was ""legal certainty"" about whether it is valid.Arguments are being heard at the Supreme Court by Lady Hale, Lord Reed, Lord Sumption, Lord Carnwarth, Lord Hodge, Lord Kerr and Lord Lloyd-Jones.Lord Keen, the Advocate General for Scotland, opened the first day of the hearing arguing that the Scottish bill is ""fundamentally inconsistent"" with the Withdrawal Bill passed by MPs.The Holyrood bill includes several provisions not mirrored in the Westminster one, such as retaining the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights and giving ministers the power to suggest EU laws to ""keep pace"" with even after Brexit.Lord Keen said it was ""perfectly clear"" that the Scottish bill was ""directly inconsistent with the UK Act at the most basic of levels"", saying ""the two simply cannot stand together"".He told the court that this would create ""dual and inconsistent regimes"" within the UK, which would ""directly frustrate the purpose"" of the Withdrawal Bill, which was to create a ""single cohesive body"" of EU laws retained after Brexit.He also argued that the continuity bill could have a bearing on international relations, a field reserved to the UK parliament. He said that ""withdrawal from the EU is a matter for the UK parliament, and the devolved administrations do not have a parallel legislative competence"" in this area.His written argument stated: ""The effect of what the Scottish bill does is to make provision for the future relationship with the EU and EU law when that relationship is under negotiation. That could serve to undermine the credibility of the UK's negotiating and implementation strategy in the eyes of the EU.""The Lord Advocate also began his submissions on Tuesday afternoon, arguing that Holyrood was not specifically barred from legislating on Brexit.He said the Advocate General had drawn too broad a definition of international relations, adding: ""I say the bill, given it has effect only in the domestic legal order, cannot affect the UK's negotiations with the EU.""He noted that the Withdrawal Bill had not been passed into law at the time the continuity bill was passed, saying that the existence of a UK bill was ""irrelevant to the questions of legislative competence"".Mr Wolffe's written submission also accuses UK law officers of an ""erroneous analysis of the legal consequences of withdrawal from the EU"".And he noted that Westminster has the power to ""amend or indeed repeal the Scottish bill"", but has not moved to do so. He said that ""any uncertainty, confusion or ambiguity arising from the presence on the statute book of these two bills will be consequence of that legislative choice"".The bulk of Mr Wolffe's arguments will be heard on Wednesday.After that, judges will also hear from the counsel general for Wales and the Northern Irish attorney general, who have made submissions as interested parties.Both have backed the Scottish government's view that Holyrood should be allowed to legislate on Brexit.The Welsh government originally had a Brexit bill of its own, which also faced a court challenge, but the legislation was withdrawn after ministers came to an agreement with UK counterparts over the Withdrawal Bill.The three options open to the judges are to give the bill the green light, to reject it entirely, or to allow some sections to stand while rejecting others.Should any part of the bill be struck down, it would go back to Holyrood for MSPs to consider making changes.The Scottish and UK governments have been unable to agree on how powers currently exercised from Brussels are to be used after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.Both sides agree that certain powers should be used to set up UK-wide frameworks of common rules and regulations, in fields like food standards and labelling. But ministers cannot agree on who should have the final say over how this should be done.Scottish ministers say giving Westminster the final say is a ""power grab"" from Holyrood, while Whitehall ministers say they cannot give MSPs a ""veto"" over UK-wide plans.With the dispute deadlocked, MSPs refused to give their consent to the EU Withdrawal Bill, giving fresh importance to the issue of the continuity bill and whether it will be allowed to stand.The Scottish government has also indicated that it will not put any of the UK government's further Brexit legislation forward for consent votes at Holyrood until the row has been resolved."

Brexiteers suspect a ""coup"" by the Remain supporters in Downing Street. Mr Raab says a single chain of command will ensure ""the best possible deal"".The home of the Red Arrows air display team is to be sold off, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed.RAF Scampton, which was also home to 617 Squadron as they prepared for the Dambusters mission in World War Two, is to close in 2022, with the display team to be moved somewhere ""more fit for purpose"". Another base, RAF Linton-on-Ouse in North Yorkshire, where fast-jet pilots are taught, and where the Duke of Cambridge underwent training, will be closed in 2020.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said £13.3m was given to the Jordanian armed force between 2015 and 2017 that had previously not been declared to Parliament.The money was given as a grant for equipment and infrastructure - including armoured vehicles, IT, accommodation and buildings.The defence secretary said steps had been taken ""to ensure than an oversight such as this does not occur again"".Communities Secretary James Brokenshire unveiled a new planning rule book - the National Planning Policy Framework - which he says will help councils challenge badly-designed developments and give local people more of a say over the kind of homes being built in their area.The minister has restored ""social rent"" to the government's definition of affordable housing following an outcry from the Local Government Association, who said more such homes were needed to tackle shortages. The term was ditched from a draft version of the framework, which added mentions of Starter Homes and build-to-rent.Under the framework, councils would also lose some powers to control developments if house building falls below 75% of national targets, leading the Council for the Protection of Rural England to claim the greenbelt is under threat.The government wants more power to block foreign takeovers if they are thought to pose a threat to national security, Business Secretary Greg Clark has announced.""These proposals will ensure we have the appropriate safeguards to protect our national security whilst ensuring our economy remains unashamedly pro-business and open to high levels of foreign investment in the future."" said Mr Clark.London's Crossrail project is running almost £600m over budget with extra funding required to complete work on the east-west railway, which is due to open in December.The project's budget has been increased from £14.8bn to £15.4bn, rail minister Jo Johnson announced, blaming ""cost pressures"". One million public sector workers are to get what the government says is their biggest pay rise in nearly 10 years. It includes 2.9% extra this year for the UK's armed forces, and in England and Wales 2.75% for prison officers, up to 3.5% for teachers, and 2% for the police. GPs and dentists in England will also see a 2% increase. Shale company Cuadrilla has been granted permission to start fracking at Preston New Road, in Lancashire, subject to certain conditions. The announcement sparked protests at the site, with six people arrested.Max Hill QC - the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation - will replace Alison Saunders as the head of the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales in November.Ms Saunders, who faced criticism after several rape trials collapsed due to evidence not being disclosed, is standing down at the end of her five-year contract.Mr Hill pledged to ""restore public trust in the Crown Prosecution Service"".The Education Support Fund had been due to close this year - but will now carry on for another two years - because more service children are expected to return to the UK with the closure of bases in Germany.Defence minister Tobias Ellwood said it would be extended on a ""limited basis"", with £3m this year and £2m in 2019-20.The government says the courts are either underused, dilapidated or too close to another and services will be moved to nearby locations.They are: Banbury Magistrates' and County Court, Maidenhead Magistrates' Court, Chorley Magistrates' Court, Fleetwood Magistrates' Court, Northallerton Magistrates' Court, Wandsworth County Court, and Blackfriars Crown Court. A proposal to close Cambridge Magistrates' Court has been withdrawn.Local authorities in England had already been allowed to continue setting a local formula for school funding in 2018/19 and 2019/20, in parallel with the government's introduction of a national funding formula. This period has been extended to 2020/21.Funding for EU programmes run by UK charities, businesses and universities has been guaranteed up to the end of 2020, even if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.Local Enterprise Partnerships replaced Regional Development Agencies in England in 2010 but they have been accused of being too complex, badly managed and lacking in accountability.Communities Secretary James Brokenshire has announced proposals to merge some of the 38 LEPs, which are meant to boost growth and investment.They will also get up to £20m of additional funding between 2018 to 2019 - and have to appoint more women to their boards and increase the diversity of those in charge.On a busy last day of term, James Brokenshire also announced that more local councils in England are being invited to apply for powers to retain the growth in their business rates.Junior sports and civil society minister Tracey Crouch published the government's response to a report on how government and employers can make it easier for people to do full time voluntary work.Security Minister Ben Wallace announced that the independent reviewer of the search and seizure powers in the 2002 Act, Douglas Bain, says it is working well but has two recommendations, although his report has yet to be made public.The law that, in theory, allows the courts to seize property, cars and other ill-gotten gains from convicted criminals has been criticised in the past for not working very well.Chancellor Philip Hammond gave a routine update on the most recent meeting of European finance ministers - something he will no longer have to do, of course, when the UK leaves the EU because he won't be invited."
2018-07-24,FOI failings,https://web.archive.org//web/20180725054241/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44864770,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMajor government departments are continuing to demonstrate persistent delays and unhelpfulness in their responses to information requests, according to research conducted by the BBC. Last June we reported on how the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Cabinet Office were frequently criticised by the Information Commissioner for their inadequate handling of FOI applications. Our analysis of decisions issued since then by the commissioner shows that the poor performance of these three departments has continued.The Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is being criticised by openness campaigners for not taking stronger action over the repeated failings. The Home Office has a particularly extreme record and has been rebuked by the Information Commissioner's Office in several dozen cases over the past 12 months.The ICO describes delays faced by requesters to the Home Office in various cases as ""unacceptable"", ""extremely lengthy"", ""particularly severe"" and ""inexplicable and unjustifiable"".In some instances the Home Office took several months to reach a decision and reply. In numerous other cases it failed to respond at all. The commissioner also reprimanded the Home Office over responses which were ""unhelpful"", showed ""poor handling"", ""did not provide any explanation"" or which contained a ""lack of detail"", ""no reasoning"", an ""extremely disappointing rationale"", or information which was ""not accurate"".Numerous ICO decision notices contain statements along the lines that the commissioner has made a record of the problem and that ""this issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases suggest that this is necessary"" or ""this may form evidence in future enforcement action against the HO should evidence from other cases suggest that there are systemic issues within the HO that are causing delays"".Since this is often repeated in the ICO decisions, it is not clear what further evidence of ""systemic issues"" ought to be required. The Ministry of Justice has also been frequently rebuked by the Commissioner for its failures to comply with the FOI law. The ICO criticises the ministry over delays which were ""very considerable"", ""far in excess of the requirement"", ""extremely lengthy"" and ""grossly excessive and entirely unacceptable"".As with the Home Office, there are numerous cases where the Ministry of Justice failed to send any response before the ICO's formal decision was issued. Similarly, many decision notices repeat the familiar statement that the failing has been noted and the issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases indicate there are systemic issues A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""We received nearly 5,000 FOI requests last year, one of the highest figures across Whitehall. We surpassed the ICO's high target for response times last year and have improved even further since - responding to 93% of requests on time in the latest figures.""The Cabinet Office also comes in for continuing criticism over its poor record on FOI.  This includes delays which were ""clearly against the spirit and intention of FOIA"", ""excessive"" and ""unacceptable"".It is also reprimanded for ""poorly conceived submissions"", lack of ""meaningful detail"", being ""illogical"", ""erroneous"", ""unsustainable"", providing ""generic"" arguments, handling which ""clearly fell short"", and having ""wrongly interpreted"" correspondence from a requester.This is despite the fact that the Cabinet Office is responsible for government FOI policy and should therefore set an example to other public authorities.Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information said that Elizabeth Denham should take stronger action: ""Departments have discovered that they can repeatedly ignore the regulator - and nothing happens. The solution is in the commissioner's hands. She should promptly serve chronic offenders with enforcement notices and threaten court action if they fail to comply.""She should also report the problem to Parliament and encourage a select committee to ask ministers in front of the TV cameras why they are treating the public's right to know with contempt.""An ICO spokesperson said: ""The ICO can take monitoring action if a public authority's performance needs to improve. Whether or not disclosure applies to a request is not always straightforward. That is why we work with departments to improve processes so decisions on what information can be released under FOI can be made more effectively and efficiently.""Requests to these departments which have been badly affected by delays include some submitted by myself and by BBC colleagues. The government departments involved have been approached for comment.Research by Patrick Cowling"
2018-07-24,Maastricht battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20180725054241/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44924844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNewly released files show how, behind the scenes, John Major decided how to overcome Conservative MPs who voted against the Maastricht treaty in July 1993.Summertime, Conservative civil war over Europe, and Rees-Mogg challenging the prime minister's European plans - but this wasn't Theresa May and Jacob Rees-Mogg but her predecessor, John Major, and his father, William, Lord Rees-Mogg. And the battle was not over Brexit but the Maastricht treaty. This was the agreement that turned the European Community into the European Union (EU) and laid the foundations for the European single currency, the euro.John Major had hailed the treaty, agreed in December 1991 by the then 12 member states, as a good deal for Britain. He praised the opportunities he believed a single market in goods and services, and the free movement of labour, offered. And he believed that a concession, allowing the UK to decide whether, not when, to join a single European currency, was key.Eurosceptic MPs said the treaty would give the EU greater powers at the expense of Westminster. They saw it as a step down the road to a centralised federal EU. And they were implacably opposed the UK joining a single European currency.In the Lords, the former Conservative Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher said that the treaty would ""diminish democracy and increase bureaucracy"".Lord Rees-Mogg went to court to stop the Maastricht treaty from becoming UK law - but judges supported the government's position, on all the issues. ""The outcome was even better than our lawyers had expected,"" Sir Roderic Lyne wrote on a note. He pointed out that Douglas Hurd, then Foreign Secretary, was ""exercising restraint"" in public as he did not want to ""provoke the Rees-Mogg brigade"" into ""further Quixotic action"".John Major enjoyed the moment. ""Good,"" he wrote on the document, ""a full gloat is merited.""Getting the treaty through the Commons took a year. Those who opposed it, from the Labour as well as Conservative benches, were vocal and well organised. But by July 1993 the end of the process was in sight.""It was the toughest time I spent in Downing Street,"" says Sir Roderic, who was John Major's private secretary at the time. ""I remember it as a nightmare.""John Major's strategy as the final vote loomed was a risky one. He would, if needed, call for a motion of confidence. If he had lost, the government would have fallen. It was, in effect, the ""nuclear option"" - either back me or face a general election.On 22 July 1993, after a series of close votes, the government lost the main motion. The ratification of the Maastricht treaty had been blocked.Then, in a moment of the highest political drama, John Major stood up at the dispatch box and announced there would be a vote of confidence in the government the following day, which would also act as a vote to write the treaty into UK law.Seeing all the papers reminds Sir Roderic of how much complex information the prime minister had to digest. ""John Major has an incredibly quick brain"" he says. ""He has a mind like a high-speed computer.""He recalls how on 21 July John Major had been depressed, knowing he had lost the first vote. He tried to work on a speech for the next day but lacked energy and went to bed. ""Everyone expected disaster,"" Sir Roderic says. Yet when he returned to Number 10 first thing next morning, the prime minister was ""perky"".""He had the glint of battle in his eye.""John Major had worked out his plan to call for confidence motion and had held three cabinet meetings to get his ministers to agree.His approach worked - opponents in his own party wouldn't vote against the government in a confidence vote. ""He basically lined the rebels up against a wall and aimed machine guns at them,"" as Sir Roderic puts it.The vote was won, by 339 to 299. John Major and his staff celebrated in his parliamentary office with champagne and congratulations arrived from European politicians. Albert Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, was friendly with Mr Major and sent a message saying: ""Well done.""Now keep your head down and drive on."" Sir Roderic Lyne is reluctant to draw too many parallels between then and now. ""Theresa May is unbelievably resilient I think,"" he says. ""Her problem is far worse than Major. He was attacked by 25 MPs. She's under fire from both right and left. And while for us, the real pressure came in the last stages, she's had it for two years."""
2018-07-24,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180725054241/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44887513,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe European Union has issued a 16-page document outlining the preparations that need to be made for Brexit. It includes advice on how countries, companies and individuals should prepare for the prospect of the UK leaving with ""no deal"" in place. BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris has read the document so you don't have to. Here are some key excerpts, and explanations of what they mean: From the outset, the EU makes one thing clear - even if negotiations go better than expected, it thinks there will be significant disruption, and everyone needs to be ready for it. (The EU talks about 30 March as exit day, by the way, because the precise time of withdrawal is due to be midnight on 30 March in Central European Time, but 23:00 on 29 March in GMT). The document emphasises that negotiations on a withdrawal agreement are continuing and that a negotiated settlement is the EU's preferred outcome.But it also notes that important issues remain unresolved - including on the protection of personal data sent to the UK while it was a member state and on the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in policing a withdrawal agreement. In particular, it states that there has been ""no progress"" in agreeing a ""backstop"" solution to avoid the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The EU notes, as it has done many times before, that time to both reach and ratify an agreement is running short. This is why preparations for ""no deal"" are so important. If there is a deal, there will also be a transition period running until 31 December 2020 during which EU rules and regulations will continue to apply in the UK. That will give businesses and governments more time to prepare for a new relationship. Without a deal, the transition (or ""implementation period"" as the UK government calls it) falls away and the relationship will change abruptly at the end of March next year. If both sides come to the conclusion several months before the end of March that there will be ""no deal"", they can at least make some contingency plans to deal with that. But if there is a last-minute hitch, time will have run out. So, from the EU's perspective, thinking about ""no deal"" means ""preparing for the worst and hoping for the best"". Much of the UK government would probably look at it in the same way - but there are many Brexiteers who think that ""no deal"" would be perfectly acceptable as long as sufficient preparations have been made.  This kind of language is scattered throughout the document. ""Don't say we didn't warn you,"" would be another way of putting it. The document stresses that some things will have to be done whatever the outcome. One thing it mentions is the need for companies to take steps to ensure that they have the right authorisations and certificates to access the EU market after Brexit. But contingency planning for ""no deal"" is the main emphasis - the EU says this is a prudent step because the outcome of negotiations ""cannot be predicted"". Among other issues, it notes that there would be no arrangement in place for EU citizens in the UK or UK citizens in the EU. It says controls at borders ""could cause significant delays, eg in road transport, and difficulties for ports"", where there could be ""long lines of vehicles waiting for customs procedures to be fulfilled"". It also says that the UK would become a third country for trade and regulatory issues, which would ""represent a significant drawback compared to the current level of market integration"". It also emphasises that while many measures would have to be taken at EU level, national, regional and local governments also need to step up their levels of preparation to ""mitigate the worst impacts of a potential cliff-edge scenario"" - cheerful stuff. And of course a lot of the attention is focused on making sure that individual EU businesses, big and small, are going to be ready for whatever emerges at the end of a highly unpredictable process of negotiation. The document notes that several EU governments, such as the Irish and the Dutch, have set up online platforms to help their companies prepare for different potential Brexit scenarios. The document also claims - in a sentence that won't please the UK government - that ""many companies are relocating to the EU27"" or expanding their operations there. EU officials insist that they are not trying to add fuel to the fire and that they are simply engaged in prudent planning. But it's a reminder that there are people in Europe, as well as in the UK, who see Brexit as an opportunity rather than a threat. The commission has now published 68 notices (anyone with a few hours to spare can read them here) on preparations in specific sectors of the economy, including health and food safety, financial services, customs, transport, and company law. They set out the legal and technical issues that governments and companies need to take into account and are another glimpse into the complexities of Brexit that stretch into every area of economic life.  In the UK, the government has not yet published any comparable information of its own.However, on Wednesday, Theresa May told MPs at the Liaison Committee that a similar number of technical notifications about what to do in the event of a ""no deal"" Brexit will be released during August and September - aimed at businesses and citizens.In response to the EU document, the Department for Exiting the European Union said ""It is the duty of any responsible government to prepare for every eventuality, including the unlikely scenario that we reach March 2019 without agreeing a deal. We have already done a lot of work behind the scenes to prepare for this - it is only natural that our European partners would seek to make similar preparations. We are keen to work closely with the EU on preparedness issues.""There are all sorts of EU databases, including many dealing with policing and internal security issues, to which the UK wants to retain access after Brexit. But the EU has argued that the UK can't simply pick and choose the bits of membership it likes - and this part of the document emphasises that work is well under way to remove the UK from numerous databases and IT systems once it becomes a ""third country"". The commission is also making preparations for changing international agreements that currently involve the UK as a member state. It says it will notify its international partners formally once it has sufficient certainty about the outcome of the current negotiations - not for a while, then. Finally, the EU document says work is under way to relocate or reassign tasks that are currently performed in the UK - such as the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre (part of the EU's project for satellites in space) or the UK-based EU Reference Laboratories - because it will not be possible ""to entrust a third country"" with such EU tasks after the withdrawal date. Two London-based agencies, the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority, are already moving to Amsterdam and Paris respectively. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade.UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States.Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world.But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops.  The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019.To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. European Council President Donald Tusk has said he believes Brexit can be halted - but there is some debate about whether the Article 50 process, the two-year legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, is reversible. (You can read a full BBC Reality Check on the debate here.) If the UK did leave and wanted to immediately rejoin, it would need all the other EU member states to agree.A less formal version of staying in the EU would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue.The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - including Justine Greening.With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.Please upgrade your browser"

On the stage with the prime minister were 45 celebrities, rounded up by the entrepreneur and Conservative fundraiser Sir Basil Feldman. They included some of the biggest names in TV at the time, including Ronnie Corbett, Jimmy Tarbuck, Bob Monkhouse and Shirley Bassey.Mrs Thatcher won, of course, and a few months later decided to give a party to thank her showbiz supporters. Forty-five guests would not fill up the grand reception rooms at Number 10 Downing Street, so the list, now revealed by the Thatcher Archive, was expanded. John Whittingdale, then Mrs Thatcher's political secretary, suggested Paul McCartney, Cliff Richard, Freddie Mercury and Mick Jagger as guests. The first two made the list, drawn up by the ministry for the arts: government ministers were added, as were civil list pensioners and sportsmen and women.This guest list, which contained 229 names, not including spouses, was copied by Mrs Thatcher's private office to Denis Thatcher, who was to co-host the party.He wrote back: ""Whilst I accept of course that not everyone who comes to our receptions are necessarily on our side I find it both unpleasant and embarrassing to entertain those who publicly insult the PM. ""This list therefore needs some careful checking in this regard.""He went through it with a red pen, ticking ""those who I would personally like to see included"" and putting a question mark by ""those who I believe do NOT help"". He added that more than one tick ""means super person and a known friend and wonderful to have them here"".Top of his list was the comic and actor Eric Sykes, who got four ticks by his name. The golfer Peter Alliss got three -  Ronnie Corbett got two ticks, as did Penelope Keith, Judith Chalmers, Tim Rice and others. More intriguing are his question marks. The artists Gilbert and George, described as ""image makers"", got two. Single question marks went to Jan Leeming, Paul Daniels and Shirley Bassey, who'd been at the Wembley rally, Paul McCartney and, oddest of all, David Attenborough.Richard Ingrams, who for many years wrote the Dear Bill letters in Private Eye magazine, purporting to be the private correspondence of Denis Thatcher to a golfing friend, has his own theory about the ticks and crosses.""One of the few things we know about Denis is that he had a very low opinion of the BBC. He thought that BBC people were all pinkos."" That might explain why Sir David got a question mark - or perhaps Denis mixed up his Attenboroughs. David's brother, the actor and director Richard, was a longstanding Labour supporter.""It's very unusual to have Denis interfering,"" Mr Ingrams adds.""Denis loved his wife and wanted to protect her, and kept out of the limelight himself. He used to say a whale only gets shot if it spouts.""Chris Collins, director of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation and editor of its vast archive website, agrees it was ""unusual"" for Denis Thatcher to involve himself to this extent. The reason, he adds, may be an earlier episode in which Mrs Thatcher considered suing BBC Radio 4's Today programme for libel over a satirical entry in a short-story competition, entitled Thatcherism: The Final Solution, which aired in January 1988.Mr Thatcher wrote a personal letter of complaint to the BBC's then chairman Marmaduke Hussey, saying that never had ""so foul a libel been published against anyone, let alone a prime minister"".Mr Collins adds that: ""The special coded system of question marks and ticks and crosses, that's actually slightly unusual.""Certainly the steam is coming out of his ears at various points in 1988 and this party he jumps on.""The final guest list included only the original 45 names, plus the 1988 British Winter Olympics team - and the parliamentary skiing team. Eddie ""the Eagle"" Edwards, whose efforts at that winter's Games had won him admirers around the world, wasn't there: he had a prior charity engagement.Richard Ingrams never met Denis Thatcher when he was writing Dear Bill, but he did later invite him to a lunch for the Oldie magazine, which Mr Ingrams founded and edited. After that, he came, as a paying punter, to literary lunches, always sending a handwritten ""thank you"" card.""And so that's quite funny, that for this party he comes down hard on people who've written unfavourably about The Boss [Margaret Thatcher], that he chose to fraternise with me! Albeit once her political career was over.""And did they ever talk about the Dear Bill letters? ""No, he never mentioned them. But maybe he thought that was just being polite.""Could Philip May ever play the same role? Richard Ingrams thinks not. ""He's playing the Denis role of keeping his trap shut. We know very little about Philip May. But Mrs May doesn't really measure up to Thatcher.""Members of the public will be able to browse through the archive from Monday 23 July by visiting www.margaretthatcher.org."
2018-07-24,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180725054241/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-24,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180725054241/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

""There is an obligation on me, and others, to instil some positivity into this negotiation process rather than political standoffs which is what we've seen to date"".Ireland's deputy prime minister said his government would back moves to lengthen the negotiating period by extending Article 50 if the UK government requested it, adding the deadline would only be extended if it was ""necessary to get a sensible agreement"".Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK was ""well positioned"" to get a good deal, and that he did not believe that there was a legal basis to delay Britain leaving the European Union.Welcoming the publication of the White Paper, Mr Coveney said it gives the negotiating teams a degree of clarity.""For much of the last six months effectively Britain has been negotiating with itself on Brexit. ""Now at least we have a White Paper where there's a clear British government position and the negotiation between the EU and the UK really starts now in earnest,"" he added.Mr Coveney dismissed as a ""simplistic notion"" the idea that the only infrastructure in the event of a hard border would be from the EU.""If the commitments given in December are followed through on then there will be no need for that external border of the EU to result in physical infrastructure.""We will ensure that the commitments that we have been given around guarantees of no border structure or related checks and controls on the island of Ireland on the Irish border is followed through on,"" he added."
2018-07-25,Jewish newspapers unite against Labour,https://web.archive.org//web/20180726042331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44957906,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK's three main Jewish newspapers have published the same front page, warning that a Jeremy Corbyn-led government would pose an ""existential threat to Jewish life"".The Jewish Chronicle,Jewish News and Jewish Telegraph move comes amid anger over Labour's anti-Semitism code.They say the party must sign up to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism.Labour says its version ""expands on and contextualises"" the IHRA definition.The party added the security and wellbeing of Jewish people was a priority and a Labour government would pose ""no threat of any kind"" to Jewish people.Labour's new code of conduct was approved by its National Executive Committee last week, but it has been criticised by Jewish leaders and some of its own MPs. Although it includes the definition of anti-Semitism given by the IHRA, it has not included all of the body's ""working examples"".Labour MPs will vote in September on whether to adopt the full IHRA wording after passing an emergency motion at a meeting on Monday night.Under the same headline, ""United we stand"", the newspapers said Labour had ""diluted"" the IHRA definition in its new code and there was a ""stubborn refusal"" from the party to accept it.They said the party had the choice of accepting the definition or ""be seen by all decent people as a racist, anti-Semitic party"".""The stain and shame of anti-Semitism has coursed through Her Majesty's Opposition since Jeremy Corbyn became leader in 2015,"" the papers say.Labour veteran Dame Margaret Hodge confronted Mr Corbyn in the Commons last week, reportedly swearing at him and calling him an anti-Semite.Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the MP said she ""blew my top"" when she found out Labour had, despite criticism, written its anti-Semitism guidelines in such a way.""And I thought rather than do what politicians usually do, and talk each other down behind our backs, I would go and confront him,"" she added. The party launched a disciplinary inquiry into the MP, which shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith has called ""completely absurd"".Speaking on Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast, Ms Griffith said: ""The idea that Jeremy would want to set up an atmosphere in the party where people couldn't go and say things to him is completely absurd. ""It's just not his way of dealing with things. I think we'd all prefer to have somebody speak to your face rather than behind your back.""Shadow chancellor John McDonnell felt Dame Margaret had ""misunderstood"" Labour's new code of conduct. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I can understand why she was so angry, if that's what she believed this code had done, and I think it is a complete misunderstanding and we can resolve that amicably.""He said the issue had to be resolved quickly and that Mr Corbyn had asked Labour's chief whip and general secretary to do this. Asked about Mr McDonnell's comments, Jeremy Corbyn said: ""I hope she [Dame Margaret] has now had a chance to read the code of conduct that we agreed at the national executive, and I hope she has had time to reflect that this is a very honest endeavour to ensure we prevent any anti-Semitism rising in our party.""The Labour Party said it was ""fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and its organisations"".""The next Labour government poses no threat of any kind whatsoever to Jewish people,"" a statement said.""The security and wellbeing of Jewish people is a priority for our party and in government we will always ensure schools, synagogues and institutions are properly protected.""We understand the strong concerns raised in the Jewish community and are seeking to engage with communal organisations to build trust and confidence in our party. We know there is a huge amount of work to do.""The party said it was ""committed to tackling and eradicating anti-Semitism in all its forms, in our party and our society"".Labour's code of conduct was drawn up after the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry. It followed allegations of anti-Semitism within party ranks.The code does reproduce the IHRA's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and lists behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples provided by the IHRA definition:But Labour has insisted that while the examples are not reproduced word for word, they are covered elsewhere in the new code."

Her brother Festus Onasanya, 33, faces three counts of the same offence.They are both due to appear at the Old Bailey on 13 August.Mr Onasanya, of Cambridge, is jointly charged with his sister on the two counts she faces relating to incidents on 24 July 2017 and 23 August 2017.The charges allege they intended to pervert the course of justice by driving a vehicle in excess of the speed limit, falsely informing the investigating authorities that a third party had been the driver and enabling them, as a consequence, to avoid such prosecution and punishment.During the July incident, Ms Onasanya is alleged to have been driving - and during the August incident, her brother is alleged to have been driving.The single count that Mr Onasanya faces relates to an incident on 17 June 2017.The BBC has contacted the office of Ms Onasanya, who won her seat in 2017.A Labour Party spokesman said: ""It would not be appropriate to comment on an ongoing case.""Ms Onasanya, who was a solicitor before being elected to Parliament, is a Labour whip, meaning she is responsible for party discipline.She won the Peterborough seat with a majority of just 607 votes, ousting Tory Stewart Jackson.Mr Jackson then took up a role as David Davis's chief of staff until the then Brexit secretary quit earlier this month."

I honestly don't know how I'm going to pay the maximum fine that they've unfairly slapped me with - despite saying there are 'substantial' matters in mitigation that they've decided to ignore,"" he said.""But this isn't just about me. Most importantly, I don't want to let the commission get away with this.""He said the commission's conduct had been ""appalling"" and its judgement against him a ""result of bias"".""I think they are undermining our democracy, and I am asking for help to expose what they are doing and to stop them,"" he said.Less than two hours after announcing his appeal, Mr Grimes had received pledges of more than £27,000.The Electoral Commission - which is the watchdog overseeing elections in the UK and ensuring that UK laws on spending by political parties are followed -  said it had applied its sanctions accordingly after a ""thorough and fair investigation"".""The laws we enforce were put in place by Parliament to provide voters with transparency and confidence in the system,"" it said.""We open investigations where the evidence justifies it, irrespective of the political views of the party or campaigner concerned.""The commission said between June 2016 and April 2018 it had published details of 38 investigations arising from the EU referendum, where offences were found - including Remain and Leave campaigners.The result of the referendum was 51.9% for Leave and 48.1% for Remain. The UK is due to officially leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019."
2018-07-25,Does the Treason Act need updating?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180726042331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44954200,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTreason might not be a charge often associated with modern life. A search of the Parliament website for the term mostly brings up the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. But Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat and his Labour colleague Khalid Mahmood want the 1351 Treason Act to be brought into the 21st Century.No-one can be executed for high treason any more - that was formally abolished in 1998 - but people can still technically be sentenced to life in prison, although the Act has not been used since World War Two.  In a report for the think tank Policy Exchange, the MPs have called for the law to be updated in order to recognise ""acts of betrayal"", such as fighting for IS, as a distinct crime. Mr Mahmood said the law in its current form had become ""unworkable"". This comes amid controversy over a government decision not to intervene in the case of two alleged Islamic State members.Some people argue that other laws, for example terrorism legislation, already cover these cases, however.The Treason Act 1351 was designed to punish people plotting or ""imagining"" the death of the monarch, ""levying war"" or ""adhering to the King's Enemies"".It has been updated a number of times since then, including in each of the last two centuries. Most recently, the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act formally abolished the death penalty for treason, replacing it with a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.Nazi propagandist William Joyce was the last person to be tried for treason in the UK in 1945. He was found guilty and executed at the start of the following year. The Law Commission is the statutory body that reviews laws in England and Wales and makes recommendations on whether they need updating. A spokesman said the Commission intended to review the law on treason in 2008, alongside laws on kidnapping and public nuisance, but the treason element of the project was shelved.However, the body's position at the time was that it had ""ceased to be of contemporary relevance"". ""Offences which once served a useful purpose no longer do so, in part because new offences have been developed which are far better suited for tackling the problems that currently afflict society,"" it said. It has no current plans to look at the law again. If acts of violence carried out in the name of a particular group or state are already prosecutable under terror legislation, why update a centuries-old law? Mr Tugendhat told BBC Reality Check that treason is the only offence currently on the statute books which recognises betrayal of the country as an offence. And bringing it up-to-date would allow it to be used to prosecute those who swear allegiance to a hostile foreign power.It is currently an offence under the Terrorism Act 2000 to belong, or profess to belong, to a proscribed organisation, including IS. But he believes the Treason Act could be used in cases of people aiding a ""hostile state"" that doesn't fall into this category, for example through cyber-attacks. And the report states: ""Between 2006 and 2017, some 193 persons were sentenced to imprisonment for terrorism offences, 80 whose sentences are due to expire by the end of this year.""It adds that if they had been convicted of treason and imprisoned for life, ""the UK would be considerably safer"".The Law Commission disagreed when it last looked at the issue. ""In the Middle Ages, England was more often than not at war. It is questionable whether treason offences are required in peacetime,"" it said, in a document published in 2008, adding that modern offences around rioting and terrorism were better equipped to deal with problems facing current society. In 2014, Justice Minister Simon Hughes was asked whether the offence of treason was ""available for use by prosecuting authorities against UK citizens participating in jihad in the Middle East"".He responded at the time that the offence of treason was outdated, and counter-terrorism powers were enough.

Capita said the contract was over its initial teething problems, while NHS England said the arrangement was saving money that was being used in frontline health services.Capita signed a seven year contract in 2015 to perform back-office tasks for NHS England.The PAC report said that once initial problems came to light, not enough was done to stop the issues getting worse.It described how delays in moving medical records from one practice to another meant patients may not have been able to access necessary care.  Some 87 women were incorrectly notified that they were no longer part of the cervical screening programme.The report also said doctors had reported problems with the transfer of medical documents, and problems caused by shortages of stock in the NHS supply chain.PAC chairwoman Meg Hillier said: ""NHS England made a complete mess of what could have been a responsible measure to save taxpayers' money.""It is clearly unacceptable that poor procurement should put patients at risk of harm and undermine the ability of GPs, dentists, opticians and pharmacists to do their jobs.""The contract with Capita was intended to reduce primary care support service costs by 35%, and modernise the service.The services outsourced included: The PAC report said neither party understood the services that were being contracted.In May the National Audit Office also issued a report on Capita's performance, saying services had been ""way below"" acceptable standards, although no harm to patients had been found.A Capita spokesman the firm had ""apologised for unacceptable failings in relation to the initial delivery of this contract"".It added: ""We are now meeting the vast majority of key performance targets, and have put in place a new governance arrangement with NHS England to ensure improvement continues.""An NHS England spokesman said: ""We will continue to work with medical professionals and Capita to resolve the historic issues which this look-back report reviews.""But by making this change over the past two years, the NHS has successfully saved taxpayers £60 million, which has been successfully reinvested in frontline NHS patient care, funding the equivalent of an extra 30,000 operations.""

2018-07-25,Court hears defence of Scots Brexit Bill,https://web.archive.org//web/20180726042331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-44938747,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHolyrood's Brexit bill ""plainly"" does not cut across EU or UK laws and should be allowed to stand, Supreme Court judges have been told.The court is considering whether the bill passed by MSPs in March was within the Scottish Parliament's remit.On Tuesday, UK law officer Lord Keen argued that it is ""fundamentally inconsistent"" with the EU Withdrawal Bill and should be struck down.But Lord Advocate James Wolffe insisted the bill was ""perfectly practical"".The court also heard from a lawyer for the Welsh government, who said the Lord Keen's arguments were ""wrong and incoherent"".And Northern Ireland's attorney general intervened to praise the Scottish bill as ""elegantly and adroitly drafted"".Judges have retired to consider the ""complicated"" case, and are not expected to issue a judgement for several weeks.The Holyrood Brexit bill - the UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Legal Continuity) (Scotland) Bill, better known as the ""continuity bill"" - was passed in March with only the Conservatives and a single Lib Dem MSP voting against it.But it was referred to the Supreme Court by UK law officers after Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh raised doubts about whether the bill was within the devolved parliament's legislative competence.The continuity bill was designed as an alternative to the EU Withdrawal Bill, the UK government's flagship piece of Brexit legislation. MSPs refused to give their consent for the Westminster bill to cut across devolved areas after a long-running row over how powers currently exercised from Brussels will be used after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019.Advocate General for Scotland Lord Keen, who made his main submissions on Tuesday, argued that the Scottish bill was incompatible with the Withdrawal Bill and ""cannot stand"" alongside it.The Withdrawal Bill had not been passed at the time the Holyrood bill was voted on, but it is now on the statute book and designated as a ""protected enactment"" which cannot be modified by the devolved parliaments.Lord Keen argued that this meant MSPs could not pass legislation which made changes to the Withdrawal Bill, saying that this would create ""dual and inconsistent regimes"" of law in the UK, causing ""confusion and uncertainty"".He also claimed that the bill cut across the reserved field of international relations, saying that ""withdrawal from the EU is a matter for the UK parliament, and the devolved administrations do not have a parallel legislative competence"" in that area.The Lord Advocate, who set out the bulk of his defence on Wednesday, argued that Lord Keen was drawing too wide a definition of international relations.He said EU law ""is not a reserved matter"", saying that because the bill ""has effect only in the domestic legal order, it cannot affect the UK's negotiations with the UK"".Mr Wolffe argued that it was ""perfectly practical"" for the Scottish bill to prepare the statute book ""in anticipation"" of the UK leaving the EU, something he said was not a ""hypothetical"" scenario but one which would soon come to pass.Noting that this is the approach the UK government has taken, he said it was ""plainly"" not incompatible with EU law, which he said prized ""legal certainty and continuity"".And he underlined that the Scottish bill was passed months before the Withdrawal Bill became law, saying that ""it was not intended to modify the UK bill and could not do so"".The court also heard from representatives of other devolved parliaments, who registered as interested parties to back the Scottish parliament's right to prepare for Brexit.QC Michael Fordham, speaking for the Welsh counsel general, told the court that Lord Keen's claims about the bill cutting across the reserved field of international relations were ""wrong and incoherent"".He said this was an ""extravagant claim which has very alarming logical implications"", adding that the argument ""just breaks down at every step"".He also argued that if the UK parliament could legislate for the statute book post-Brexit, the devolved parliaments could ""perfectly properly"" do the same, saying: ""The rule of law must be the same for everyone.""Northern Irish Attorney General John Larkin also backed Holyrood's right to legislate on Brexit, submitting that ""the bill and all of its provisions are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament"".He said the bill was ""elegantly and adroitly drafted"", and while some provisions ""may have caused teeth to gnash in Whitehall"", it could operate successfully.The judges - Lady Hale, Lord Reed, Lord Sumption, Lord Carnwarth, Lord Hodge, Lord Kerr and Lord Lloyd-Jones - are not expected to return a judgement until the autumn."

Brexiteers suspect a ""coup"" by the Remain supporters in Downing Street. Mr Raab says a single chain of command will ensure ""the best possible deal"".The home of the Red Arrows air display team is to be sold off, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed.RAF Scampton, which was also home to 617 Squadron as they prepared for the Dambusters mission in World War Two, is to close in 2022, with the display team to be moved somewhere ""more fit for purpose"". Another base, RAF Linton-on-Ouse in North Yorkshire, where fast-jet pilots are taught, and where the Duke of Cambridge underwent training, will be closed in 2020.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said £13.3m was given to the Jordanian armed force between 2015 and 2017 that had previously not been declared to Parliament.The money was given as a grant for equipment and infrastructure - including armoured vehicles, IT, accommodation and buildings.The defence secretary said steps had been taken ""to ensure than an oversight such as this does not occur again"".Communities Secretary James Brokenshire unveiled a new planning rule book - the National Planning Policy Framework - which he says will help councils challenge badly-designed developments and give local people more of a say over the kind of homes being built in their area.The minister has restored ""social rent"" to the government's definition of affordable housing following an outcry from the Local Government Association, who said more such homes were needed to tackle shortages. The term was ditched from a draft version of the framework, which added mentions of Starter Homes and build-to-rent.Under the framework, councils would also lose some powers to control developments if house building falls below 75% of national targets, leading the Council for the Protection of Rural England to claim the greenbelt is under threat.The government wants more power to block foreign takeovers if they are thought to pose a threat to national security, Business Secretary Greg Clark has announced.""These proposals will ensure we have the appropriate safeguards to protect our national security whilst ensuring our economy remains unashamedly pro-business and open to high levels of foreign investment in the future."" said Mr Clark.London's Crossrail project is running almost £600m over budget with extra funding required to complete work on the east-west railway, which is due to open in December.The project's budget has been increased from £14.8bn to £15.4bn, rail minister Jo Johnson announced, blaming ""cost pressures"". One million public sector workers are to get what the government says is their biggest pay rise in nearly 10 years. It includes 2.9% extra this year for the UK's armed forces, and in England and Wales 2.75% for prison officers, up to 3.5% for teachers, and 2% for the police. GPs and dentists in England will also see a 2% increase. Shale company Cuadrilla has been granted permission to start fracking at Preston New Road, in Lancashire, subject to certain conditions. The announcement sparked protests at the site, with six people arrested.Max Hill QC - the government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation - will replace Alison Saunders as the head of the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales in November.Ms Saunders, who faced criticism after several rape trials collapsed due to evidence not being disclosed, is standing down at the end of her five-year contract.Mr Hill pledged to ""restore public trust in the Crown Prosecution Service"".The Education Support Fund had been due to close this year - but will now carry on for another two years - because more service children are expected to return to the UK with the closure of bases in Germany.Defence minister Tobias Ellwood said it would be extended on a ""limited basis"", with £3m this year and £2m in 2019-20.The government says the courts are either underused, dilapidated or too close to another and services will be moved to nearby locations.They are: Banbury Magistrates' and County Court, Maidenhead Magistrates' Court, Chorley Magistrates' Court, Fleetwood Magistrates' Court, Northallerton Magistrates' Court, Wandsworth County Court, and Blackfriars Crown Court. A proposal to close Cambridge Magistrates' Court has been withdrawn.Local authorities in England had already been allowed to continue setting a local formula for school funding in 2018/19 and 2019/20, in parallel with the government's introduction of a national funding formula. This period has been extended to 2020/21.Funding for EU programmes run by UK charities, businesses and universities has been guaranteed up to the end of 2020, even if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.Local Enterprise Partnerships replaced Regional Development Agencies in England in 2010 but they have been accused of being too complex, badly managed and lacking in accountability.Communities Secretary James Brokenshire has announced proposals to merge some of the 38 LEPs, which are meant to boost growth and investment.They will also get up to £20m of additional funding between 2018 to 2019 - and have to appoint more women to their boards and increase the diversity of those in charge.On a busy last day of term, James Brokenshire also announced that more local councils in England are being invited to apply for powers to retain the growth in their business rates.Junior sports and civil society minister Tracey Crouch published the government's response to a report on how government and employers can make it easier for people to do full time voluntary work.Security Minister Ben Wallace announced that the independent reviewer of the search and seizure powers in the 2002 Act, Douglas Bain, says it is working well but has two recommendations, although his report has yet to be made public.The law that, in theory, allows the courts to seize property, cars and other ill-gotten gains from convicted criminals has been criticised in the past for not working very well.Chancellor Philip Hammond gave a routine update on the most recent meeting of European finance ministers - something he will no longer have to do, of course, when the UK leaves the EU because he won't be invited."

He said their response was that ""this government's going to go in the autumn anyway"". He told them that was ""a short-term view"".""I am going to keep on talking to them to convince them that the more they prop up this government, the more damage this government will do and we might as well get to the situation where we enable Labour to take over negotiations,"" he added.""Or, failing that, let's have a general election and let the people decide.""He said he respected their view but added: ""I just say to them, as respectfully as I possibly can, you are making the wrong decision here, come alongside."" He said the Labour Party was making preparations ""to go into government"" including a Queen's Speech and a Budget, in case there is another election.Kelvin Hopkins, who is currently sitting as an independent after being suspended by the Labour Party, also backed the government in one of the key Brexit votes.The four Labour rebels have come under fire on social media from supporters of Jeremy Corbyn for ""propping up"" the government.But they say they are standing up for the millions of Labour supporters who voted to leave the EU.After the Commons vote, Mr Field told his local newspaper, the Liverpool Echo, he did not think it could have brought about the fall of the government.""I voted knowing that two-thirds of Labour constituencies in the country voted to leave,"" he said.""One reason for that was that people in Westminster and Whitehall and in elite groups don't wish to listen to them.""I wanted to make sure that those two-thirds of Labour constituencies had a voice.""Ms Hoey, who is facing a campaign by Corbyn-backing Momentum in her Vauxhall constituency to expel her from the party, has been similarly defiant.""I have had the same views on the EU since being elected and they knew these views as they were always in my election addresses,"" she told the Huffington Post.""I voted against the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties and for a referendum and always in the same lobby as the now leader.""

The assembly's Presiding Officer Elin Jones confirmed Mr Thomas's resignation in a statement at about 10:00 BST on Wednesday, saying ""the Llywydd has received a letter of resignation from Simon Thomas with immediate effect"".Asked if police had searched his office in Cardiff Bay, a spokeswoman for the Assembly Commission, which is in charge of the day-to-day running of the institution, said: ""We are co-operating with the police and have no further comment to make."" Plaid Cymru chairman Alun Ffred Jones said the party was ""aware of a police investigation into allegations of a serious offence"". He added: ""Due to that ongoing investigation it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.""Mr Thomas, a former librarian who lives in Aberystwyth, was a special senior advisor to former deputy first minister Ieuan Wyn Jones after losing his seat at Westminster and before he was elected to the assembly.He was also a contender to succeed Mr Jones as party leader in 2012, but dropped out of the contest which was won by Leanne Wood. The resignation of Mr Thomas will not trigger a by-election as he was elected via the regional list system, where voters choose a party rather than a specific candidate.When a regional AM resigns, they are usually succeeded by the person who was next on the list for their party at the previous assembly election in that particular region.Former AM Helen Mary Jones, who was next in line on the Plaid list in the region, will now decide whether she wants to replace him.The 58-year-old was an AM between 1999 and 2011, firstly representing Llanelli and then the Mid and West Wales region.Ms Jones, who now works at Swansea University, said on Twitter she was ""in something of a state of shock"". ""I have now got some big decisions to make in the next few days,"" she added."

""It is very clear that we do not deal with devolved decision making,"" he said.""This is about protecting the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement because there's been an absence of government in Northern Ireland for 19 months now and that's impacting communities in Northern Ireland in negative way.""He said the agenda had included legacy issues, security co-operation, political instability in Northern Ireland and east-west co-operation post Brexit.""British ministers and Irish ministers simply won't be meeting in the future in the same way and as frequently as we have done for more than four decades now and so we have instructed senior officials to come up with definitive proposals on how an Irish government and British government in the future can have structured and interactive dialogue at cabinet level in the same way that France and Germany have, for example.""This sends a very clear signal that Britain and Ireland are going to remain very close, regardless of the challenges we face.""Asked if the Republic of Ireland would suffer more than the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit, he said:  ""I think there's probably too much talk of the negative consequences of a no-deal Brexit. ""Instead, we need to focus on what we do as negotiators. Clearly, for Ireland, a no-deal Brexit is bad and for Britain too. ""I do not think that is a likely scenario and if it were to happen, it would be a failing of politics on a very significant scale.""The meeting is a symbol of the failure of the two governments and the Northern Ireland parties to make any progress in their efforts to overcome the political logjam. Nationalists have been keen to see the intergovernmental conference convened, sometimes portraying it as a forum where important decisions can be made. Unionists are not fans of the conference, alternately suspicious that it could be used as a vehicle to try to increase Dublin's influence in Northern Ireland's affairs and derisory about what the DUP describes as its ""talking shop"" consultative role.For many months, the British government resisted Dublin's official requests for the conference to be convened, with ministers expressing the view that they did not want to do anything to make the situation at Stormont worse.But eventually they agreed to the Irish request, while at the same time playing down the significance of Wednesday's meeting. Technically, the conference is only meant to discuss non-devolved issues, although how to define that may be up for debate given the absence of both the Stormont Assembly and Executive. It is unclear what impact the intergovernmental conference will have on unlocking the stalemate at Stormont.British and Irish ministers have met many times before to assess how they can move things forward.It will probably require a real change in the political weather to enable any movement to take place, rather than simply a change in the format and title given to London and Dublin's interactions. Earlier, the former Northern Ireland first minister, Lord Trimble, accused Dublin of meddling.  But Mr Coveney rejected that claim.The Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley, Irish Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan and the Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington - who is effectively the Prime Minister's Number Two - attended the conference.After the formal conference is over, Mr Coveney  was expected to hold a separate meeting with the new UK Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab."

What's happened in the opinion polls and what can they tell us about what could happen when Parliament returns in the autumn?Please enable Javascript to view our poll tracker.In the first six months of 2018 the Westminster voting intention opinion polls were rather dull. But since the cabinet awayday at Chequers on 6 July, and the publication of the government's Brexit white paper the following week, there has been a marked change.For months the polls only moved very gradually. Between January and the beginning of July support for Labour dipped a couple of percentage points whilst the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats went up by about one per cent each.That did mean the Tories were fairly reliably in the lead, but only narrowly. Then came Chequers - and the calm of the first half of the year came to an abrupt end.The Conservatives have seen their rating fall back. In a couple of polls they've been at 36%, their lowest level since last year's general election.As a result, Labour has moved ahead in a sequence of polls for the first time since February.The other beneficiaries of the Conservative drop are UKIP. Until Chequers they'd not topped 5% this year. They've been above that in each of the last five published polls.None of this should be exaggerated. The movements aren't massive. But after months where changes happened at a snail's pace, it's a striking development.It could yet turn out that this is just a blip. The absence of warring Conservative MPs from Westminster might see the public's view of the party improve. But if it is a blip, it's a pretty big one.And it potentially foreshadows further turbulence in the autumn when Theresa May and the EU hope to finalise a Brexit deal.To see how difficult the prime minister's task is on Brexit just look at polls about it.Voters remain pretty evenly split about whether it was a good decision.We've seen a continuation of the trend from 2017. Over time, the number of people who say that Brexit was the wrong decision has very gradually increased, but there's no sign of a consensus forming.Worse still for the prime minister, polls which seek to capture what people think should happen next suggest an even more divided public.An interesting poll by new polling firm Deltapoll asked precisely that question: According to this poll, there's no course of action which has the support of even a third of voters. That could cause problems for Theresa May. It's going to be very hard for her to please a majority of the public whatever she does."

The Sun said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was a ""big mouth and a fool"". ""It has exposed beyond doubt both his crass naivety and the cynical deceit of the EU masters he cravenly obeys,"" said an editorial in the paperBut what are the facts in the case? Speaking at a press conference in County Kerry on 18 July, Leo Varadkar said a no-deal Brexit would see Britain leave the Single European Sky programme, which co-ordinates flights in Europe.""If they want their planes to fly over our sky, they would need to take that into account,"" he said.Tomorrow's front page: The Irish PM was branded ""mad"" last night for threatening to block British planes flying over his country. https://t.co/r3aFRhfiM2 pic.twitter.com/DQ6LJqbl5GEnd of Twitter post  by @TheSun""The situation at the moment is that the UK is part of the Single European Sky and if they leave the EU they are not.""And that does mean if there was a no-deal hard Brexit next March, the planes would not fly and Britain would be an island in many ways - and that is something they need to think about.""Leo Varadkar was wrong to suggest British aircraft would be barred from Irish airspace in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to Downing Street.So-called ""overflight rights"" are guaranteed by international treaties rather than EU membership, said a Number 10 spokeswoman. The spokeswoman said the UK was confident of reaching a deal that included ""aviation access"".""It's wrong to claim that Ireland could simply stop the UK from flying over its land as a result of Brexit.""The reason we say that is because overflight rights are not guaranteed by the EU, rather by multilateral treaty which both ourselves and Ireland have signed up to.""The international treaty referred to by the UK government is the Chicago Convention which 52 states signed on 7 December 1944.It effectively guarantees the right of civil aviation to fly over the air space of signatory states without permission, but not necessarily to land. As Mr Varadkar talks about ""planes flying over our sky"", he is probably wrong on that point - and the UK government correct.However, the real issue would be planes landing and taking off at EU airports if the UK leaves European Single Sky and the European Aviation Safety Agency with no deal to replace their regulations.Mr Varadkar was speaking in terms of a ""no-deal Brexit"", while the UK government was responding in terms of reaching a deal. His ""planes would not fly"" remark could in theory become a reality if there was no deal, the need for which is tacitly implied in the UK statement. The Sun certainly took Mr Varadkar's comments as a threat, as did some unionist politicians in Northern Ireland. ""Given that the Irish State is dependent on the RAF for its air defence in the event of a terrorist attack it is obviously exceedingly unwise for  Varadkar to pompously and arrogantly suggest that Dublin could deny civilian aircraft from the UK access to Irish airspace,"" said Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister. DUP MLA Christopher Stalford countered that the Republic of Ireland gets its gas supply through the UK.Where the Republic of Ireland gets its gas from. Remember this the next time Leo decides to threaten the UK over airspace. pic.twitter.com/DR08JCtViNEnd of Twitter post  by @CStalfordMLA""Remember this the next time Leo decides to threaten the UK over airspace,"" he tweeted.In fact, the Republic of Ireland is on course to get the majority of its gas from Irish sources within the next few years.However Mr Varadkar was defended on social media by the Irish government's spokesperson on the EU""To be fair he merely reiterated a factual statement that Philip Hammond also made earlier this year,"" said Senator Neale Richmond. Eamonn Brennan, chief executive of the Irish Aviation Authority said as early as February 2017: ""Air connectivity all over the world is based on Air Service Agreements and once the UK leaves the EU a new Air Service Agreement will have to be put in place between the EU27 and the UK.Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair, has repeatedly warned that the UK is running out of time to agree a new open skies agreement with the EU, saying there is a ""real prospect"" that there will be no flights between the UK and Europe for a period beyond March 2019.In July 2017, the head of the Aerospace body ADS said that the UK must remain an EU member during a post-Brexit transition period.Aviation expert Paul Everitt said the UK would struggle to sign the necessary agreements with global safety regulators before then, risking disruption to air travel.""If we don't have a transition arrangement and if we aren't a member of the EU as part of that transitional arrangement, then we have chaos because we don't have a system to ensure that our products are safe and secure to fly and a regime that is acknowledged around the world,"" he said.Aviation consultant John Strickland said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the current aviation traffic rights framework would no longer apply.""Theoretically, at midnight on that day planes would be grounded,"" he said.But he questioned the likelihood of that happening. ""Even if technically a deal comes to an end it wouldn't be logical that you would just accept that that commercial airline traffic stops just to make a political point because you would be starving the economy,"" he added.""Whether you are on the UK side, or the Irish side, or the remain side, or the leave side… I don't see anybody that wins from the suspension of air services."""
2018-07-25,FOI failings,https://web.archive.org//web/20180726042331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44864770,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMajor government departments are continuing to demonstrate persistent delays and unhelpfulness in their responses to information requests, according to research conducted by the BBC. Last June we reported on how the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Cabinet Office were frequently criticised by the Information Commissioner for their inadequate handling of FOI applications. Our analysis of decisions issued since then by the commissioner shows that the poor performance of these three departments has continued.The Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is being criticised by openness campaigners for not taking stronger action over the repeated failings. The Home Office has a particularly extreme record and has been rebuked by the Information Commissioner's Office in several dozen cases over the past 12 months.The ICO describes delays faced by requesters to the Home Office in various cases as ""unacceptable"", ""extremely lengthy"", ""particularly severe"" and ""inexplicable and unjustifiable"".In some instances the Home Office took several months to reach a decision and reply. In numerous other cases it failed to respond at all. The commissioner also reprimanded the Home Office over responses which were ""unhelpful"", showed ""poor handling"", ""did not provide any explanation"" or which contained a ""lack of detail"", ""no reasoning"", an ""extremely disappointing rationale"", or information which was ""not accurate"".Numerous ICO decision notices contain statements along the lines that the commissioner has made a record of the problem and that ""this issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases suggest that this is necessary"" or ""this may form evidence in future enforcement action against the HO should evidence from other cases suggest that there are systemic issues within the HO that are causing delays"".Since this is often repeated in the ICO decisions, it is not clear what further evidence of ""systemic issues"" ought to be required. The Ministry of Justice has also been frequently rebuked by the Commissioner for its failures to comply with the FOI law. The ICO criticises the ministry over delays which were ""very considerable"", ""far in excess of the requirement"", ""extremely lengthy"" and ""grossly excessive and entirely unacceptable"".As with the Home Office, there are numerous cases where the Ministry of Justice failed to send any response before the ICO's formal decision was issued. Similarly, many decision notices repeat the familiar statement that the failing has been noted and the issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases indicate there are systemic issues A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""We received nearly 5,000 FOI requests last year, one of the highest figures across Whitehall. We surpassed the ICO's high target for response times last year and have improved even further since - responding to 93% of requests on time in the latest figures.""The Cabinet Office also comes in for continuing criticism over its poor record on FOI.  This includes delays which were ""clearly against the spirit and intention of FOIA"", ""excessive"" and ""unacceptable"".It is also reprimanded for ""poorly conceived submissions"", lack of ""meaningful detail"", being ""illogical"", ""erroneous"", ""unsustainable"", providing ""generic"" arguments, handling which ""clearly fell short"", and having ""wrongly interpreted"" correspondence from a requester.This is despite the fact that the Cabinet Office is responsible for government FOI policy and should therefore set an example to other public authorities.Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information said that Elizabeth Denham should take stronger action: ""Departments have discovered that they can repeatedly ignore the regulator - and nothing happens. The solution is in the commissioner's hands. She should promptly serve chronic offenders with enforcement notices and threaten court action if they fail to comply.""She should also report the problem to Parliament and encourage a select committee to ask ministers in front of the TV cameras why they are treating the public's right to know with contempt.""An ICO spokesperson said: ""The ICO can take monitoring action if a public authority's performance needs to improve. Whether or not disclosure applies to a request is not always straightforward. That is why we work with departments to improve processes so decisions on what information can be released under FOI can be made more effectively and efficiently.""Requests to these departments which have been badly affected by delays include some submitted by myself and by BBC colleagues. The government departments involved have been approached for comment.Research by Patrick Cowling"
2018-07-25,Juncker vs Trump,https://web.archive.org//web/20180726042331/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44935473,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window""Trade tariffs are the greatest,"" President Donald Trump has declared before Wednesday's vital US-EU talks aimed at averting an all-out trade war.An ominous message for the head of the EU's executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, as he heads to Washington. Both sides have already slapped tariffs on billions of dollars of imports, but a lot more is at stake.At first glance the two men look like chalk and cheese but there are plenty of similarities.Both see themselves as consummate deal-makers with the personal touch. Neither is known for sticking to the scripts prepared by their advisers. Each has said that relations with Russia should be less confrontational. At the G7 summit in Canada, Donald Trump described European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker as ""a brutal killer"".  Mr Juncker replied that it was unusual for someone from Luxembourg to be treated as a threat. So the banter is flowing already. The EU and the US are embroiled in a trade war, although Brussels would never describe it that way. The US government has applied tariffs of 25% on imports of steel from the EU and 10% on aluminium, alleging that US national security is threatened.The EU retaliated with levies on American exports worth more than $3bn, including iconic items like bourbon, jeans and motorbikes. Now US authorities are considering hitting back with measures to limit imports of European-made cars. Inevitably President Trump explained it in a tweet:  ""If these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!""The EU thinks that the rationale for the American measures on aluminium and steel  - that it's all about national security - is ridiculous. A challenge has been lodged at the World Trade Organization. The European Commission has already sent the US authorities an 11-page document which argues that targeting European car companies would be counterproductive because 120,000 American jobs are directly reliant on them. And Brussels fears for the future of the rules-based order under President Trump, but you get the impression they quite enjoy playing the role of saviour of the system. It looks that way. President Trump recently described the European Union as ""a foe"". He sees the EU's trade surplus with the US as a problem. He relishes Brexit. And he really doesn't like the EU's ""tax lady"" - the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, who has repeatedly fined American tech firms millions and millions of euros. She has confirmed that she is a woman and she does work on tax, but that she doesn't have a problem with the USA specifically. The European Commission has said the trip is part of a ""dialogue"" designed to ""de-dramatise"" the situation. This is EU code for ""Don't expect too much.""At the start of hostilities, the EU dangled the prospect of a free trade deal that would slash tariffs on goods flowing between the US and Europe. That offer has been withdrawn because the EU does not like the idea of negotiating under threat. Jean-Claude Juncker has had to fend off allegations that he was drunk at a Nato summit after television cameras caught him struggling to walk. He said he was suffering a bout of the painful nerve condition, sciatica. His advisers asserted that his work wasn't affected and that he got on a plane to China the next day. Then there was a slightly weird interlude where Mr Juncker privately gave a false date of the Washington meeting to demonstrate that no-one in Brussels could keep a secret. ""And I was successful in that endeavour because the incorrect information was passed straight on to the press,"" he said at the EU leaders' summit in June. But this is a case where he is entitled to say he speaks for the whole European Union because trade is one of the areas where member states have handed control to Brussels.Before flying to Washington, Mr Juncker spoke to the leaders of France, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria.So far the 28 member states have stuck together, but everyone knows that US action on cars would hurt Germany the most, and EU countries have a habit of thinking of themselves rather than the European project when vital national interests are treated. Chancellor Angela Merkel has appealed for unity, saying ""the European Union will hopefully act as united again as it has done now"".But France's finance minister has already warned that the idea of solving the problem with a trade deal for cars poses a risk to the European automotive industry by opening it up to more global competition."
2018-07-25,Maastricht battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20180726042331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44924844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNewly released files show how, behind the scenes, John Major decided how to overcome Conservative MPs who voted against the Maastricht treaty in July 1993.Summertime, Conservative civil war over Europe, and Rees-Mogg challenging the prime minister's European plans - but this wasn't Theresa May and Jacob Rees-Mogg but her predecessor, John Major, and his father, William, Lord Rees-Mogg. And the battle was not over Brexit but the Maastricht treaty. This was the agreement that turned the European Community into the European Union (EU) and laid the foundations for the European single currency, the euro.John Major had hailed the treaty, agreed in December 1991 by the then 12 member states, as a good deal for Britain. He praised the opportunities he believed a single market in goods and services, and the free movement of labour, offered. And he believed that a concession, allowing the UK to decide whether, not when, to join a single European currency, was key.Eurosceptic MPs said the treaty would give the EU greater powers at the expense of Westminster. They saw it as a step down the road to a centralised federal EU. And they were implacably opposed the UK joining a single European currency.In the Lords, the former Conservative Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher said that the treaty would ""diminish democracy and increase bureaucracy"".Lord Rees-Mogg went to court to stop the Maastricht treaty from becoming UK law - but judges supported the government's position, on all the issues. ""The outcome was even better than our lawyers had expected,"" Sir Roderic Lyne wrote on a note. He pointed out that Douglas Hurd, then Foreign Secretary, was ""exercising restraint"" in public as he did not want to ""provoke the Rees-Mogg brigade"" into ""further Quixotic action"".John Major enjoyed the moment. ""Good,"" he wrote on the document, ""a full gloat is merited.""Getting the treaty through the Commons took a year. Those who opposed it, from the Labour as well as Conservative benches, were vocal and well organised. But by July 1993 the end of the process was in sight.""It was the toughest time I spent in Downing Street,"" says Sir Roderic, who was John Major's private secretary at the time. ""I remember it as a nightmare.""John Major's strategy as the final vote loomed was a risky one. He would, if needed, call for a motion of confidence. If he had lost, the government would have fallen. It was, in effect, the ""nuclear option"" - either back me or face a general election.On 22 July 1993, after a series of close votes, the government lost the main motion. The ratification of the Maastricht treaty had been blocked.Then, in a moment of the highest political drama, John Major stood up at the dispatch box and announced there would be a vote of confidence in the government the following day, which would also act as a vote to write the treaty into UK law.Seeing all the papers reminds Sir Roderic of how much complex information the prime minister had to digest. ""John Major has an incredibly quick brain"" he says. ""He has a mind like a high-speed computer.""He recalls how on 21 July John Major had been depressed, knowing he had lost the first vote. He tried to work on a speech for the next day but lacked energy and went to bed. ""Everyone expected disaster,"" Sir Roderic says. Yet when he returned to Number 10 first thing next morning, the prime minister was ""perky"".""He had the glint of battle in his eye.""John Major had worked out his plan to call for confidence motion and had held three cabinet meetings to get his ministers to agree.His approach worked - opponents in his own party wouldn't vote against the government in a confidence vote. ""He basically lined the rebels up against a wall and aimed machine guns at them,"" as Sir Roderic puts it.The vote was won, by 339 to 299. John Major and his staff celebrated in his parliamentary office with champagne and congratulations arrived from European politicians. Albert Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, was friendly with Mr Major and sent a message saying: ""Well done.""Now keep your head down and drive on."" Sir Roderic Lyne is reluctant to draw too many parallels between then and now. ""Theresa May is unbelievably resilient I think,"" he says. ""Her problem is far worse than Major. He was attacked by 25 MPs. She's under fire from both right and left. And while for us, the real pressure came in the last stages, she's had it for two years."""
2018-07-25,At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20180726042331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44858385,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWith the UK on course to leave the European Union in March next year, the country faces four possible scenarios.The UK and the EU both insist they want as amicable a divorce as possible, with a legal agreement setting out the kind of relationship they will have when the UK is no longer a member of the club.Prime Minister Theresa May wants to keep close ties with the EU in certain areas, such as trade in agricultural products and allowing skilled migrants access to jobs in the UK.She says her plan will allow Britain to take back control of its laws, money and borders, just like people voted for in the 2016 EU referendum, while also allowing as ""frictionless"" trade as possible and avoiding a physical border for Northern Ireland.But it has been attacked as an unworkable compromise by people from both the Remain and Leave ends of the debate.The EU may also decide to reject it, but the two sides are still hoping to strike some kind of deal by the autumn and, despite criticism and ministerial resignations, Mrs May believes this is the best option.A clean break with the EU. The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade.UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States.Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world.But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops.  The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019.To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. European Council President Donald Tusk has said he believes Brexit can be halted - but there is some debate about whether the Article 50 process, the two-year legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, is reversible. (You can read a full BBC Reality Check on the debate here.) If the UK did leave and wanted to immediately rejoin, it would need all the other EU member states to agree.A less formal version of staying in the EU would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue.The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - including Justine Greening.With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock.

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-25,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180726042331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

She is also due to attend a World War One memorial event marking the centenary of the battle of Amiens, which began on 8 August 1918, before heading off for two weeks' holiday in Switzerland.The UK's White Paper, drawn up after agreement with the cabinet at Chequers, proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but will end free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations.It would involve the UK collecting some EU tariffs - in a bid to ensure frictionless trade in goods and to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland - under its proposed Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-foods. The plan sparked two UK cabinet resignations - former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday that the EU ""will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules and VAT and excises duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU's governance structures"".Any customs arrangement or union ""must respect this principle"", he said.But UK Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the White Paper proposals had been designed ""both to respect the result of the referendum and the core principles of the EU."" He added: ""We have considered the innovative approaches the EU has taken in the past with other third countries - when the political will has been there.""In sum, the UK has set out our plans in detail. Those plans are ambitious, principled and pragmatic. I am committed to injecting new energy into these talks, along with Michel."""
2018-07-26,Private probation contracts to end early,https://web.archive.org//web/20180727030717/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44973258,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPrivate companies that run probation services are to have their government contracts ended early - after MPs said the system for supervising criminals was in a ""mess"".The contracts began in 2015 to manage low-risk offenders in England and Wales, under a partial privatisation by then-Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.Ministers are proposing further changes and private firms will remain involved.But Labour said the costly contracts had created an  ""unprecedented crisis"".It comes after the Commons justice committee said in July that changes to probation had failed, and it was unconvinced private sector firms could ever deliver an effective service.BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the government had hoped that shaking up probation would result in less reoffending. The number of people reoffending has reduced slightly, but those that do are committing crimes more frequently.  The arrangements for managing offenders were overhauled in 2014, with the probation service split in two. A new state body, the National Probation Service (NPS), was set up to supervise high-risk offenders, with 21 privately run Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) supervising low and medium-risk offenders.But David Gauke, who became justice secretary in January, said that while the £3.7bn Transforming Rehabilitation (TR) programme had been ambitious and innovative, several CRCs had made ""very substantial losses"".Mr Gauke said the amount of work available for the CRCs had been ""lower than anticipated and that has had an impact in terms of their income and the services they are able to provide"".He also said he was determined to have a service that reduced reoffending, and could oversee ""tough"" community sentences with less reliance on ""ineffective"" short prison terms.Existing contracts will now end two years early, in 2020 - and will be replaced with 10 new ones under changes that will cost the government £170m. This includes £110m that the CRCs owe the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) in fines for failing to meet performance targets - but which they will be allowed to reinvest in services to keep them going for the last two years of their agreements.The MoJ will also pay £46m over the next two years for services that help offenders immediately after they are released from prison.The MoJ said it had budgeted to pay firms £2.5bn by 2020 but had only paid out £2.2bn - a saving of £300m - because less work than anticipated was allocated to the CRCs.This was because there was an increase in the proportion of serious offences which they were ineligible to work on.Mr Gauke said new contracts would make better use of offending data and would move towards ""payment for services delivered"", but he ruled out allowing CRCs to take on high-risk cases.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said: ""This decision to throw more good money after bad and the government's re-commitment to a privately-run probation service shows that the Conservatives have run out of all ideas on how to fix their broken system."" And the GMB union said the probation officers it represented were overworked and demoralised. GMB national officer George Georgiou said: ""Fragmenting the service has moved us away from a coherent national workforce strategy for the entire probation service.""But the government's proposals were welcomed by the chief probation inspector, Dame Glenys Stacey.Dame Glenys, who was critical of probation services in her report in December, said: ""There is much to welcome in these proposals, and we are pleased to see that our inspection evidence and findings and our wider advice have had significant influence and impact.""Are you a probation officer?

2018-07-26,Targeted pro-Brexit Facebook ads revealed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180727030717/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44966969,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe official Vote Leave campaign spent more than £2.7m on targeting ads at specific groups of people on Facebook - helping it to win the 2016 EU referendum.The US social media giant has now released these ads to a committee of MPs investigating fake news - meaning everyone, not just those they were originally aimed at, can now see them.The ads, created by Canadian company Aggregate AIQ, often focused on specific issues - such as immigration or animal rights - thought likely to push the buttons of certain groups of people, based on their age, where they lived and other personal data taken from social media and other sources.The 120 pages of documents appear to back up the findings of the Electoral Commission, which ruled last week that Vote Leave broke electoral law by working jointly with another campaign, BeLeave - something denied by both groups.A number of BeLeave ads were sent from the Vote Leave Facebook account, including this one:There are 1,433 different messages in the data set released by Facebook, all with one common theme - although it is not always clear that they have come from a pro-Brexit campaign.Here is one that was targeted at animal lovers:This one, targeted at tea-lovers, is more obviously pro-Brexit:Polar bears were also recruited to the cause:The adverts contained in the Facebook data set were seen more than 169 million times in total. Some of them were micro-targeted, with 252 of them seen fewer than 1,000 times. The BeLeave messages were more closely directed at younger voters, promising a ""brighter future"" if the UK could stop ""EU regulators keeping us in the past"" and accusing Brussels of regulating ride-sharing apps such as Uber and enforcing quotas on data streaming.Data provided by Facebook suggests some of the most seen images were produced by BeLeave. This image was displayed on the screens of target audience members more than five million times: Older voters tended to be treated to claims about how much money the UK was sending to the EU. More than 140 ads made reference to the controversial claim that £350m a week sent to the EU could be spent on the NHS instead:Alternative uses for the £350m included schools and flood defences: Vote Leave made the most of then US President Barack Obama's intervention in the referendum campaign, when he said the UK would be at the ""back of the queue"" for trade deals.This ad was heavily targeted at older voters, with a reach of up to 25% among woman aged over 65 and 23% of men in that age group targeted by one version of it (as with many of the ads, the accompanying text was tweaked and refined from a basic ""parent"" ad):Immigration was another common theme, with one ad appearing to suggest the entire Turkish population was headed for the UK: Boris Johnson was the only politician to be pictured in the ads:Apart from one featuring Jeremy Corbyn, which was targeted at younger voters and accompanied by an old quote from the Labour leader: ""The EU takes away from national parliaments the power to set economic policy and hands it over to an unelected set of bankers.""Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party spent £32,750.73 with AIQ on pro-Brexit Facebook ads. Only 16 of the ads were delivered to users in Northern Ireland, according to the Facebook data. The remaining 24 were primarily seen by people in England.The 24 adverts, seen at least 1.96 million times - and potentially as many as 4.2 million times - were all posted in the final three days of the EU referendum campaign.Early on in the campaign, Vote Leave launched a giant data harvesting exercise through a competition to win £50m if you could correctly guess the result of all 51 games in the 2016 European football championship.The odds of winning the contest - which Vote Leave funded through an insurance policy - were calculated at one in 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. It was described by one Vote Leave insider at the time as a potential ""game changer"" because it would allow it to gather the contact details of thousands of potential voters, many of whom would not normally be interested in the referendum.The campaign recruited former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham to promote the contest:A separate group called Veterans for Britain had refused permission for its ads to be passed on, said Facebook.The Culture Media and Sport Committee is expected shortly to publish interim findings from its inquiry into fake news, which has taken evidence from whistleblower Christopher Wylie and technology company bosses as well as representatives of the separate Leave.EU campaign."

It was messy, sweaty, with an almost daily roll call of nightmares for the government. Senior MPs say privately there were genuine moments, even last week, when various colleagues - not the usual suspects - were agitating to try to remove the prime minister. The government lost an important vote, but scraped through a vital one. The chief whip got caught out with some epic skulduggery. Big cabinet bruisers walked out, trashing the main government policy as they did.As the temperature rose, so did tempers. One senior MP told me that some significant Conservative backers were discussing withholding their next donations to the party because they were so unhappy at how Number 10 has been handling things. There have been plenty of moments of ""it can't go on like this"". But, ""it"" can, and it normally does.After the summer break then, when the prime minister will hope everyone in her party has calmed down, rather than plotted on WhatsApp from their sun loungers, how does the government ""go on like this""? What are the ways through? The first thing to say is that no country has left the European Union before like this. So there is no precedent. There is no map. Whether you find it deeply thrilling, or deeply alarming, ask even those who have held some of the highest offices in the land what happens if it all goes wrong and they don't know. There are, though, scenarios that can be sketched out.This might be fantasy but it's not impossible. Say Theresa May manages to get the EU to broker something on the basis of her latest plan and comes back with what one of her longstanding allies describes as ""Chequers minus minus"". There will likely have to be concessions on giving the EU more cash and more concessions on immigration, but it is a just about swallowable deal. It won't have escaped your notice by now that warnings about ""no deal"" are coming thick and fast, and ever more scarily, from ministers' mouths. This is no coincidence. It is not beyond the wit of man to see that stoking concern about ""no deal"" could, conveniently, encourage MPs to feel they have little choice but to vote for it. However, it is abundantly clear that there is a solid core of Brexiteer Tories who simply would not vote for it. And you can near as dammit be sure that Labour's official position won't be to back the government. One of the Labour leadership team told me: ""We will push her to the brink."" Don't underestimate either the concern that could spread far and wide about whether a deal like that would really be what people had voted for. So far, Number 10's analysis that the majority of people just want the prime minister to get on with Brexit and are not paying huge attention has been shown to be more or less right (not withstanding very vocal groups on either side of the debate). The dynamics of the actual deal might well change that.  But in Parliament, senior backers of Mrs May know that to get the vote through they'd have to rely on many Labour MPs either abstaining or voting with the government. If rejecting the deal feels like opening Pandora's box versus supporting a fudgey compromise, there could well be enough of them to allow Mrs May to squeak through. Maybe. And then, maybe, Europe will go back to being just another issue, albeit an important one.We will be in the EU departure lounge for a couple of years. Trade talks will be tricky, there will be plenty to sort out - but a deal will have been done and the government can, in theory, tell the public we are out, and life can get back to something approaching normal. Hmmm.It's also possible to see how the government does not even get that far. Right now, it seems the prime minister is absolutely intent on getting a deal. Those who know her well (it's not a long list!) say that is what is driving her above all else - getting something done. The mantra ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" has not aged well.But if the further concessions that the rest of the EU demands, for demand they will, are just too intense, requiring too much on immigration, or extra payments, forcing the prime minister not just to pinken her red lines but to scrub them out altogether, then maybe that could change and she could walk away. Right now it seems unlikely, but the chances of no deal have been rising. One diplomat, in sorrow more than anger, last week said to me he simply couldn't see how the EU would be able to offer anything that the prime minister could get through Parliament. Yes, anything that is viable at all.But if there is ""no deal"", and the government actually puts that on the table, it is hard to see Parliament backing that either. Many Tories, including many in government, are talking about when, not if, they make it plain that they would never support leaving without concluding an agreement. Those discussions are taking place, including among some serving ministers. What some Brexiteers have always wanted - a simple free trade deal - does find supporters around the EU. Indeed, one well-placed official suggested to me that if the White Paper wasn't coherent or workable, and the jury is very much out on that, then the EU could simply say in October, it's a basic deal on trade or nothing. Some Brexiteers would rejoice. But that would also have to come with the backstop to prevent a hard border in Ireland, which right now, despite all sorts of ideas being floated, is still a huge obstacle to getting a deal done. The prime minister says she simply couldn't sign up to it. And until there is a shift - or a magical solution - that way through the quagmire is out of reach. And indeed, if it becomes obvious in the autumn that the prime minister wants to sign something that is even more of a compromise than Chequers, then her nemesis, the Eurosceptics, might try to oust her well before she gets to bring the deal to Parliament. Then we are properly in a land where anything is possible. The Article 50 process is a legal mechanism, with a fixed deadline. But if the ruling party crashed into a leadership contest? If there was no one to negotiate with? Who knows? Could that mean a general election? Perhaps, a second referendum? Not out of the question. The People's Vote campaign pushing for this are stepping up their activities - not just in Westminster but around the country. By the time we sign off next summer, the government could have just navigated its way through the most complicated and troublesome political waters in decades. Or there could be a new prime minister, and the Conservative Party might have actually succeeded in smashing itself to bits. It will be 13 years then since David Cameron vowed the Tories would ""stop banging on about Europe"". It seems deeply optimistic to imagine that by then, they will have been able to move on. I, however, for the next few weeks won't be banging on about anything. It's the political holidays. Thank you for reading this page through another epic political year, and I'll see you on the other side when, the only thing I am really sure of, there will be plenty more to discuss. "
2018-07-26,UK halts co-operation with US over 'Beatles' duo,https://web.archive.org//web/20180727030717/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44973586,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK has suspended co-operation with the US over two Islamic State suspects.Ministers had said they would share intelligence with the US that could lead to the men's conviction, without opposing a death penalty sentence.However the mother of one of the men has now launched a legal challenge to prevent such information sharing.The Home Office has halted co-operation until a judge has had a chance to consider an application for judicial review.Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, both of whom have been stripped of British nationality, are wanted for being part of the IS kidnap gang behind hostage executions. They are accused of being the last two members of an IS group dubbed ""The Beatles"" because of their British accents. Lawyers for the mother of El Shafee Elsheikh have now prepared detailed grounds challenging Mr Javid's decision to share information with the US without a death penalty assurance - meaning a case could be before High Court judges in days. They said the home secretary's actions revealed ""a clear and dramatic departure from the UK's long standing international and domestic commitment to oppose the continuing exercise of the death penalty.""A Home Office spokesperson said the government had ""agreed to a short-term pause"" but was confident it had ""acted in full accordance of the law"".The two men are currently being held by Kurdish forces and the UK believes it cannot legally extradite them to face trial here.  This week it emerged that the US was preparing the ground to prosecute the men itself - and that it had asked the UK for information that would help convict them.  In a letter leaked to the Daily Telegraph, Home Secretary Sajid Javid wrote that the UK would not oppose the use of the death penalty if the two men were extradited to the US.In the past Britain has sought assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used in cases where the UK provided information or extradited suspects.Number 10 had said this was ""a long-standing position"" to oppose the death penalty but added that in this case it was ""a priority to make sure that these men face criminal prosecution"".Analysis by BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic CascianiThe home secretary's position boils down to a simple question: Would you run the risk of them going free? Given Elsheikh and Kotey are in the custody of Syrian Kurdish forces, that sounds unlikely. But British prosecutors can't bring the men for trial here because they're not being held by a recognised state with whom the UK has a legally recognised extradition agreement - it would amount to kidnap.The forces holding the men are, however, backed by the US - and American courts are less fussy about the legalities of how a suspect ends up in the dock. The US may need British information to make a prosecution stick - hence the co-operation. This challenge from Mr Elsheikh's mother isn't about that evidence - but whether the ministerial decision to share it demolishes the UK's internationally recognised opposition to capital punishment. In case after case down the years, the UK has refused to provide legal help that could lead to overseas executions.So this decision to help the Americans, made in the hope of landing a conviction of two of the most wanted men in the world, could turn into a major legal fight. Labour accused the UK of having ""unilaterally abandoned"" its opposition to the death penalty.The former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Lord Carlile said this constituted ""a unilateral change of policy without any consultation"".The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said a senior British government official told him that this case was not the first time that the UK had dropped its request for assurances that the death penalty would not be used.But our correspondent said if the pair were sent to the controversial US military prison Guantanamo Bay - where suspects have been detained without trial - the UK would withhold intelligence."

The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March next year.The People's Vote campaign is hoping to get enough MPs, including the Labour leadership, to back a referendum on the deal Theresa May strikes with Brussels, which is due to be put to a vote in Parliament in October.In a statement backing the People's Vote campaign, he said: ""I am not a politician but I know when something is going wrong and right now Brexit feels like it is going very wrong indeed.""He said politicians seemed ""unable to resolve the problem"" the EU referendum had given them.Lineker has been critical of Brexit on social media in recent times, attracting claims of bias from Brexit supporters.  Critics have also pointed to a Twitter message he sent a year ago, which said ""Can't find the bit in my tweet where I ask for another referendum. Leave won. Get over it.""Replying to those comments, Lineker tweeted he was ""happy to admit I've now changed my mind"", adding that he did not envisage ""at the time that we'd ever contemplate a 'no deal Brexit' and the ensuing carnage that would bring"".A spokesman for the BBC said: ""Gary is not involved in any news or political output for the BBC and as such any expression of his personal political views does not affect the BBC's impartiality.""Senior Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who campaigned for Brexit in the referendum, was asked about Lineker's comments on ITV's Good Morning Britain.He said: ""I hesitate to criticise any individual - they're entitled to their opinion - but he's only one individual and during the referendum there were lots of stars and people who came out and endorsed this or the other, but people made up their own minds.""On the idea of MPs deciding to call a fresh referendum, he said that although most MPs had been for Remain in the 2016 vote, ""they have to accept the result... this will be a crisis for our democracy if the British people are ignored""."
2018-07-26,Medical cannabis products to be legalised,https://web.archive.org//web/20180727030717/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44968386,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSpecialist doctors in the UK will be able to legally prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products by autumn, the home secretary has announced.Those that meet safety and quality standards are to be made legal for patients with an ""exceptional clinical need"", Sajid Javid said.As it is a devolved matter, it will require legislative change before it is enforced in Northern Ireland.Legalisation follows high-profile cases involving severely epileptic children.Many had previously been denied access to cannabis oil.Others forms of cannabis will remain illegal.Mr Javid's decision was made after the chief medical officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies, and the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said patients with certain medical conditions should be given access to the treatments.Their advice was part of a review into medicinal cannabis launched by the home secretary following an outcry over Billy Caldwell and Alfie Dingley being denied access to cannabis oil.The parents of the boys, who have rare forms of epilepsy, say it controls their seizures. The Home Office recently granted them licences to access the treatments. Mr Javid said: ""Recent cases involving sick children made it clear to me that our position on cannabis-related medicinal products was not satisfactory.  ""That is why we launched a review and set up an expert panel to advise on licence applications in exceptional circumstances.""This will help patients with an exceptional clinical need but is in no way a first step to the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use.""Billy Caldwell's mother, Charlotte, said Mr Javid's announcement had been made on her son's 13th birthday.""For the first time in months I'm almost lost for words, other than 'thank you Sajid Javid',"" she said. ""Never has Billy received a better birthday present, and never from somebody so unexpected...""But, crucially, my little boy Billy can now live a normal life with his mummy because of the simple ability to now administer a couple of drops a day of a long-maligned but entirely effective natural medication.""A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""The rescheduling of cannabis-derived medicinal products is a devolved matter and requires legislative change.""The Department of Health notes the advice provided by experts during the two-part review commissioned by the Home Secretary.  ""Consideration will be given to rescheduling cannabis-derived medicinal products in Northern Ireland in line with the rest of the UK ""In the interim, clinicians may still apply to the Home Office Expert Panel should they wish to use a cannabis-based medicine in the treatment of a patient."" Cannabis is classed as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning it is judged to have no therapeutic value but can be used for the purposes of research with a Home Office licence.The decision by the Home Office will put certain cannabis-derived products into Schedule 2 - those that have a potential medical use - and will place them in the same category as cocaine and heroin, among other drugs. The Department for Health and Social Care and the Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will now develop a clear definition of what constitutes a cannabis-derived medicinal product so they can be rescheduled and prescribed, the Home Office said. In the meantime, clinicians will still be able to apply to an independent expert panel on behalf of patients wishing to access these products. The home secretary said licence fees for applications made to the panel will be waived, and those already granted will not be charged.The home secretary's decision was welcomed by campaigners and health experts.Donna Kinnair, from the Royal College of Nursing, said the decision was ""very welcome"".Dr Tom Freeman, senior academic fellow at King's College London, said Mr Javid's decision would have a ""substantial impact on research by facilitating the development of safer and more effective medicines"".Former justice minister Sir Mike Penning, who was among those appealing for Alfie Dingley to be given a special licence for medicinal cannabis, welcomed the announcement but said there were still unanswered questions about which treatments would be rescheduled.""Any move to restrict medical cannabis in the UK to a very narrow range of derived products, each requiring full pharmaceutical trials, thereby blocking out the many products available overseas, will lead to great disappointment and be a missed opportunity.""

The EU plans to buy more US liquefied natural gas (LNG) and soybeans.A joint statement said the two leaders agreed to ""work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods"".US import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium, imposed in March, will however remain in place.Obviously the European Union, as represented by @JunckerEU and the United States, as represented by yours truly, love each other! pic.twitter.com/42ImacgCN0End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpA working group of senior advisers will meet to facilitate trade and lower barriers. The two sides pledged to refrain from new trade restrictions during those negotiations.A full-blown trade war had been looming, fuelled by the tariffs introduced by Mr Trump.EU-US relations had been further frayed by Mr Trump's tributes to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his attacks on Nato and the EU.Mr Trump's language after meeting Mr Juncker was enthusiastic, in contrast with the angry tone he adopted previously towards the EU, calling it a ""foe"" on trade.Mr Trump has come under pressure domestically because of retaliatory tariffs imposed on US goods by China, the EU, Canada and Mexico.US chipmaker Qualcomm Inc appeared to be the latest casualty of the trade row with China. It dropped a $44bn (£33.5bn) bid to take over NXP Semiconductors, after China failed to give approval for it. On Tuesday the Trump administration announced up to $12bn in aid for US farmers hurt by the Chinese tariffs.Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump declared a ""new phase in the relationship"" between the US and the EU, calling it a ""very big day for free and fair trade"".Mr Juncker thanked the president and hailed a ""constructive meeting"".Mr Trump said the EU would become a ""massive buyer"" of US liquefied natural gas and the joint statement said EU imports of LNG would increase, to diversify Europe's energy supply.Mr Trump has condemned Germany's project to expand imports of Russian natural gas, via a new Baltic pipeline.""The EU is going (...) to buy a lot of soybeans from our farmers, primarily in the Midwest,"" Mr Trump said.Adam Fleming, BBC News, BrusselsEU officials have been giving more details of the deal brokered in Washington. The working group will investigate long-term ways to reduce tariffs on industrial goods - not cars or agricultural products - and how to bring down the extra tariffs on steel and aluminium recently applied by US authorities. It will report at the end of November - after the midterm elections in the US. The pledge to buy more American soybeans is actually a promise not to interfere in market forces that mean the EU is buying more anyway. ""We are not turning into a Soviet-style economy,"" said an official. And this is not a revival of the controversial TTIP trade pact between the EU and US or a big free trade agreement. That would take much longer and would require the consent of the EU member states. The pair also agreed to work towards reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Mr Trump accuses the WTO of treating the US unfairly - though mostly the US has won in arbitration cases there.Mr Juncker said striking a deal on zero tariffs on industrial goods was his ""main intention"". ""I had one intention today, to make a deal, and we made a deal. We have a number of areas on which to work together,"" he said.No announcement was made on car tariffs, and it was not clear whether any progress had been made on resolving the issue. Mr Trump had threatened to impose 25% import tariffs on European cars.On Twitter, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the two were ""turning a page"" on trade, while German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier hailed it as a ""breakthrough"". Congrats to @JunckerEU, @realDonaldTrump: Breakthrough achieved that can avoid trade war &  save millions of jobs! Great for global economy!End of Twitter post  by @peteraltmaierGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted (in German): ""Juncker showed in Washington that it's really not about who tweets most aggressively, but about whether one offers real solutions. Because Trump's grassroots also feels that it only loses when we impose more and more senseless tariffs on each other.""French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed the agreement, but called for ""clarifications"". He said there was no point trying to clinch any major trade deal with the US. Agriculture must be excluded, he said, because Europe could not compromise on food safety and environmental standards.Mr Trump scorned the proposed EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which stalled two years ago. But his ""deal"" with Mr Juncker echoes some of TTIP's ambition.A former US Ambassador to the EU, Anthony Gardner, made that point in a tweet.Idea of significantly more LNG shipments to EU absurd. It is not price competitive with piped gas. In TTIP we had already agreed to eliminate 97pc of tariffs including all industrial tariffs — nothing new there though Trump of course will take credit. https://t.co/a2Z49cA239End of Twitter post  by @tonylgardner"

""That sets out opportunities for us to continue to have good trade with the European Union in the future whilst delivering on what people for.""We'll prepare for a 'no deal' because it's sensible, practical, to make those pragmatic preparations.""But what we're working for as a government is to get a good deal, and a good deal based on the Chequers agreement which, as I've heard today, would be a good deal for Welsh farmers.""On funding, Mrs May said: ""Well, first of all we've made a commitment to farmers. We've said that the overall funding will be the same as under the CAP [EU Common Agricultural policy] until the end of this Parliament. ""We've actually given farming that certainty up until 2022. That enables people to make the planning necessary.""And we will be making sure that we get a system that is in the interests of Welsh farmers, in the interest of farmers across the United Kingdom. ""What matters is that out of the EU we'll be able to put in place arrangements that are in our interests and the interests of our producers and not part of the Common Agricultural Policy.""Welsh Government Rural Affairs Secretary Lesley Griffiths said: ""The best thing the prime minister can do to help us to deliver our responsibilities for the Welsh farming industry is to avoid a hard Brexit and deliver on the promise made during the referendum that Wales won't lose a penny of funding as a result of leaving the EU.""Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards said EU funds had been a ""lifeline"" for Welsh farming and the industry would be ""far better off staying within European frameworks"". ""In the run-up to the EU referendum we were promised that rural Wales would not be a penny worse off after Brexit,"" he said.""After today's deeply worrying comments by the prime minister, that promise lies in tatters."""
2018-07-26,Regular heatwaves 'will kill thousands',https://web.archive.org//web/20180727030717/https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-44956310,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe current heatwave could become the new normal for UK summers by 2040 because of climate change, MPs say. The Environmental Audit Committee warns of 7,000 heat-related deaths every year in the UK by 2050 if the government doesn't act quickly.Higher temperatures put some people at increased risk of dying from cardiac, kidney and respiratory diseases. The MPs say ministers must act to protect people - especially with an ageing population in the UK.Scientists differ on whether the current global rash of heatwaves is definitely caused by climate change. But all agree that future heatwaves will be hotter and more frequent thanks to carbon emissions.The MPs highlight a warning from the Met Office that UK summer temperatures could regularly reach 38.5C by the 2040s.The government says it is committed to cutting carbon emissions, although it is not on track to meet its targets.The MPs say current plans will not stop buildings overheating, and ministers should be smarter about heat-proofing the UK. Tougher rules are needed to ensure homes and transport networks can deal with extreme heat.And local councils should plant trees and keep green spaces to provide cool air.During the 2003 heatwave, excess deaths in nursing homes in parts of the UK rose by 42%.The MPs want hospitals and care homes inspected to check they can cope with scorching heat.Committee chair Mary Creagh said: ""Heatwaves threaten health, wellbeing and productivity.""The government must stop playing pass-the-parcel with local councils and the NHS, and develop a strategy to protect our ageing population from this increasing risk.""In a densely populated city, temperatures are higher. Homes built in the 1960s and 1970s present a particular risk, as can flats with windows that are small, hard to open or face the same way.The committee complains there is no regulation to prevent overheating in buildings. It wants the government to stop supporting the building of modular homes, which are factory-made then bolted together. It also calls for shading structures on buildings.Following the heatwave in August 2003, statisticians linked 2,091 deaths to the unusually high temperatures.Heat isn't a cause that appears on anyone's death certificate. So how do we measure the death-toll of a heatwave?Excess mortality figures are arrived at by comparing the death rate in a given period to the average for that period in previous years.We don't know that heat was a factor in all of those deaths - just that there were that many more deaths than the average for the same period over the previous five years.Death rates in summer tend to be relatively stable so this was an unusual spike. Researchers used this 2,091 figure as a baseline when calculating how many more people could die in heatwaves by 2050. They estimated there would be an increase of more than 200%, giving the 7,000 figure.The Office for National Statistics doesn't regularly look at how many deaths are linked to hot weather, but it does regularly publish excess winter mortality data. More people die in winter than in summer because of cold weather and higher rates of infectious illnesses such as flu. In the winter of 2016-17, there were 34,300 excess deaths compared with the death rate in the summer. The report says only 50% of UK motorways and major roads are surfaced with material that can withstand the kind of summer temperatures the country is beginning to experience regularly. During June's heatwave, railway tracks buckled causing cancellations and delays. High heat reduces productivity. Workers arriving sweating to the office take time before they're ready to do the job. People working outside find themselves doing less and needing more breaks.The committee says Public Health England should tell employers to relax dress codes and allow flexible working in heatwaves. Maximum workplace temperatures should also be introduced, especially for physical work.In schools, head teachers should be advised about safe classroom temperatures. And they should relax school uniform policy during hot weather.A recent study suggested wealthy private schools that could afford air conditioning would increase the relative exam success of their pupils during summer heat.Cities can be up to 10C hotter than the surrounding countryside because hard surfaces absorb heat during the day and give out heat at night. This is the heat island effect.If people get too hot in bed, it prevents them recovering from the previous day's heat. Yet the government's planning framework makes no mention of the heat island effect.And ministers withdrew funding for local authority climate change adaptation officers, who were working on the issue.The report calls for towns and cities to be adapted to more frequent heatwaves.There have been consistent demands for water companies to store more water, especially in dry south-east England, and to plug leaks. New homes should have to use water more efficiently, MPs say. Kathryn Brown, head of adaptation at the Committee on Climate Change, said: ""Water shortages are a concern. We can expect greater water deficits across the country, including in cooler wetter areas like north-west England. ""The area of land well suited to the production of water-intensive crops, such as rain-fed potatoes, could decline by over 80% by the 2050s.""The committee says the government's heatwave alert system runs only from June to September, so vulnerable people will not be warned about unseasonal heatwaves. The MPs heard that alerts are put out only if approximately 30°C is reached, even though Public Health England said heat-related deaths began at upwards of 25°C.In the UK, many more preventable deaths happen because of cold weather than hot weather, but the government has failed to deliver its targets for insulating homes.If the UK's winters get warmer, as generally predicted, winter deaths will be reduced. But in a year like this one, the UK has suffered extremes of cold and heat. Both heat-related and cold-related health burdens in future will be amplified by population ageing.Charities point out that the UK's challenges from future heatwaves will be dwarfed by those in poor nations, which haven't caused the climate problem.A study by Prof Richard Tol, at the University of Sussex, suggests poorer countries are likely to see their economic growth slowed because they depend on agriculture and outdoor work.His study says nations with hot climates will need economies three times larger than cooler countries if they are to withstand significant temperature rises.He says policymakers must consider poverty reduction as a crucial element of climate policy.An official told BBC News the government would ""carefully consider"" the report and would keep taking ""robust action to ensure our country is resilient and prepared"".The ""long-term plan for climate change adaptation"" will see work and investment to protect food and water supplies, businesses and communities, the official said.Follow Roger on Twitter.You must enable JavaScript to view this content.Compare the temperature where you are with more than 50 cities around the world, including some of the hottest and coldest inhabited places.

2018-07-26,No deal Brexit 'to push up food prices',https://web.archive.org//web/20180727030717/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44966961,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe former boss of supermarket chain Waitrose has warned that a ""no deal"" Brexit would push up the cost of fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy products.Lord Price, a former Conservative trade minister, said fresh food could not be stockpiled like packets or tins.The government says it will act to secure food supplies if the UK leaves without a deal in March.It comes as Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resumes talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels.Both sides are focused on getting a deal by October that can be ratified by the UK Parliament and the EU member states before Britain officially leaves on 29 March next year.But they are also stepping up preparations for the consequences of talks breaking down without a deal.Lord Price, who quit the government in September, said: ""What you will see is, rather than a pinch on supply - although that is highly likely - a pretty significant increase in the cost of fruit and veg, the cost of meat and the cost of dairy products.""He said the UK only produces about 25% of the fruit and vegetables it consumes and, while the winter season for imports from places like South America and New Zealand could be extended slightly to cover the UK's EU departure, supermarkets would have to find new supply routes.""They may think about air freight, they may think about shipping,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""But all these things are going to add cost and they are going to add to the cost of a tariff that will be applied because the EU has pretty penal tariffs on food, to protect European farmers.""France's European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau told Today a ""no deal"" Brexit would mean ""traffic jams in Calais and in each and every European port welcoming goods and people coming from the United Kingdom"".She added: ""We would all suffer. The worst would be for the United Kingdom.""Some UK ministers have dismissed talk of food shortages in the shops in the event of there being no deal.""I am not aware of any plans for stockpiling food. It seems to me to be a fairly ridiculous scare story,"" Brexit Minister Lord Callanan told the House of Lords last week.""There are many countries outside of the European Union that manage to feed their citizens perfectly satisfactorily without the benefit of EU processes."" Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab told MPs on Tuesday the government would take steps to ensure an ""adequate food supply"".In an interview with Channel 5's 5 News on Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May did not deny that stockpiling was happening, saying the government is being ""responsible and sensible"" while still trying to get a good deal with the EU.Mrs May has taken personal control of Brexit negotiations, which are being run by a unit in the Cabinet Office reporting directly to her.Mr Raab is holding face-to-face talks with Mr Barnier at the end of the latest round of Brexit negotiations, along with senior civil servant Olly Robbins.

Her brother Festus Onasanya, 33, faces three counts of the same offence.They are both due to appear at the Old Bailey on 13 August.Mr Onasanya, of Cambridge, is jointly charged with his sister on the two counts she faces relating to incidents on 24 July 2017 and 23 August 2017.The charges allege they intended to pervert the course of justice by driving a vehicle in excess of the speed limit, falsely informing the investigating authorities that a third party had been the driver and enabling them, as a consequence, to avoid such prosecution and punishment.During the July incident, Ms Onasanya is alleged to have been driving - and during the August incident, her brother is alleged to have been driving.The single count that Mr Onasanya faces relates to an incident on 17 June 2017.The BBC has contacted the office of Ms Onasanya, who won her seat in 2017.A Labour Party spokesman said: ""It would not be appropriate to comment on an ongoing case.""Ms Onasanya, who was a solicitor before being elected to Parliament, is a Labour whip, meaning she is responsible for party discipline.She won the Peterborough seat with a majority of just 607 votes, ousting Tory Stewart Jackson.Mr Jackson then took up a role as David Davis's chief of staff until the then Brexit secretary quit earlier this month."

But many people do not fit neatly into either category, throwing up complex and unexpected dilemmas for both the Home Office and the individuals concerned.Some, such as Ursula Crosby, who contacted the BBC with her story, have been unable to get a clear answer about how to secure residency rights, and citizenship, when Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Ms Crosby retired to Portugal five years ago after 40 years of working as a physiotherapist in NHS hospitals, in London and Shrewsbury. She says she felt like spreading her wings and ""doing something a bit different"" while she could.She is a German citizen but under free movement rules she had the security of knowing she could return to the UK, where her daughter lives and where she still owns property, when she wanted to.Brexit has changed that. The UK has told EU citizens they will be able to apply for ""settled status"" if they have been living in the UK for five years or have been granted indefinite leave to remain. It is unclear how this will apply to Ms Crosby, who was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 1979. Indefinite leave to remain - despite the name - usually expires if you have left the country for two years or more, as is the case with Ms Crosby. She has received conflicting advice from UK officials about whether she would qualify for settled status and no-one has been able to tell her what will happen if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. For all the government's assurances about how easy it will be for EU citizens after Brexit, getting a straight answer on all but the most straightforward of cases is very difficult, if the experience of researching this article is anything to go by.At one point, Ms Crosby was referred to an independent immigration adviser, who told her she would be all right because Britain would probably stay in the European Economic Area after Brexit - which would be news to Prime Minister Theresa May, who has repeatedly ruled that out.She is now torn between selling up and moving back to the UK before Britain leaves the EU in March, or risking moving back at a later date, during the 21-month transition period that will follow Brexit, in the hope that she can still secure settled status.""I am sure I could live in Germany but I wouldn't really want to live in Germany,"" says the 68-year-old. ""I no longer have any connections there, as such. My parents are dead. I have a cousin in Germany. ""I could stay in Portugal but I am not sure I would want to. It was never my intention to and I still have property in England.""If I ask anybody who meets me, they all think I am British.""She first came to the UK in 1971, on a work permit, long before EU free movement rules came into force, and was married to a British man for many years.She now regrets not applying for British citizenship when she had the chance but, like many others, she did not think she needed to.""There are probably quite a lot of people in this situation,"" says immigration lawyer Colin Yeo, ""people that used to live in the UK, perhaps for a very long time, who were assuming they would be able to come back to the UK because it is a member of the EU.""They will probably be all right if they come back during the transition period.""But, he adds, many will feel ""they have got to come back now or they will lose the chance"". Ms Crosby says she can't understand why, as someone in receipt of a full UK state pension, as well as an NHS pension, she may have to wait five years after returning to the UK to qualify for British citizenship, the same as someone from an EU country who has never lived there.""I am an honest person, I have no convictions, I paid my taxes and if I go back I will be able to support myself. Am I doing any harm?"" she says.The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases, but a spokeswoman said: ""After we leave the EU, in March 2019, there will be an implementation period that ends on 31 December 2020, during which EU citizens and their family members will be free to live, work and study in the UK as they do now. ""EU citizens and their family members who become resident in the UK during the implementation period will be able to make an application to the EU Settlement Scheme and be eligible for temporary leave to remain and, after five years' lawful residence, settled status, under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement. ""The rights of those EU citizens arriving during the implementation period will be safeguarded on the same terms as has been agreed for those EU citizens resident in the UK before we leave the EU.""Ms Crosby remains unconvinced by the Home Office's reassurances - and she has written to the department to try to get some clear guidance on what she should do next.""I am not sure I can rely on the immigration system to relax their very inflexible rules,"" she says.""My worst fear is that I sell up here, move back to England and then find out that it would not have been necessary."""
2018-07-26,Pollwatch: The Chequers effect,https://web.archive.org//web/20180727030717/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44937732,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs are leaving Westminster for the summer recess. What's happened in the opinion polls and what can they tell us about what could happen when Parliament returns in the autumn?Please enable Javascript to view our poll tracker.In the first six months of 2018 the Westminster voting intention opinion polls were rather dull. But since the cabinet awayday at Chequers on 6 July, and the publication of the government's Brexit white paper the following week, there has been a marked change.For months the polls only moved very gradually. Between January and the beginning of July support for Labour dipped a couple of percentage points whilst the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats went up by about one per cent each.That did mean the Tories were fairly reliably in the lead, but only narrowly. Then came Chequers - and the calm of the first half of the year came to an abrupt end.The Conservatives have seen their rating fall back. In a couple of polls they've been at 36%, their lowest level since last year's general election.As a result, Labour has moved ahead in a sequence of polls for the first time since February.The other beneficiaries of the Conservative drop are UKIP. Until Chequers they'd not topped 5% this year. They've been above that in each of the last five published polls.None of this should be exaggerated. The movements aren't massive. But after months where changes happened at a snail's pace, it's a striking development.It could yet turn out that this is just a blip. The absence of warring Conservative MPs from Westminster might see the public's view of the party improve. But if it is a blip, it's a pretty big one.And it potentially foreshadows further turbulence in the autumn when Theresa May and the EU hope to finalise a Brexit deal.To see how difficult the prime minister's task is on Brexit just look at polls about it.Voters remain pretty evenly split about whether it was a good decision.We've seen a continuation of the trend from 2017. Over time, the number of people who say that Brexit was the wrong decision has very gradually increased, but there's no sign of a consensus forming.Worse still for the prime minister, polls which seek to capture what people think should happen next suggest an even more divided public.An interesting poll by new polling firm Deltapoll asked precisely that question: According to this poll, there's no course of action which has the support of even a third of voters. That could cause problems for Theresa May. It's going to be very hard for her to please a majority of the public whatever she does."

The Sun said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was a ""big mouth and a fool"". ""It has exposed beyond doubt both his crass naivety and the cynical deceit of the EU masters he cravenly obeys,"" said an editorial in the paperBut what are the facts in the case? Speaking at a press conference in County Kerry on 18 July, Leo Varadkar said a no-deal Brexit would see Britain leave the Single European Sky programme, which co-ordinates flights in Europe.""If they want their planes to fly over our sky, they would need to take that into account,"" he said.Tomorrow's front page: The Irish PM was branded ""mad"" last night for threatening to block British planes flying over his country. https://t.co/r3aFRhfiM2 pic.twitter.com/DQ6LJqbl5GEnd of Twitter post  by @TheSun""The situation at the moment is that the UK is part of the Single European Sky and if they leave the EU they are not.""And that does mean if there was a no-deal hard Brexit next March, the planes would not fly and Britain would be an island in many ways - and that is something they need to think about.""Leo Varadkar was wrong to suggest British aircraft would be barred from Irish airspace in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to Downing Street.So-called ""overflight rights"" are guaranteed by international treaties rather than EU membership, said a Number 10 spokeswoman. The spokeswoman said the UK was confident of reaching a deal that included ""aviation access"".""It's wrong to claim that Ireland could simply stop the UK from flying over its land as a result of Brexit.""The reason we say that is because overflight rights are not guaranteed by the EU, rather by multilateral treaty which both ourselves and Ireland have signed up to.""The international treaty referred to by the UK government is the Chicago Convention which 52 states signed on 7 December 1944.It effectively guarantees the right of civil aviation to fly over the air space of signatory states without permission, but not necessarily to land. As Mr Varadkar talks about ""planes flying over our sky"", he is probably wrong on that point - and the UK government correct.However, the real issue would be planes landing and taking off at EU airports if the UK leaves European Single Sky and the European Aviation Safety Agency with no deal to replace their regulations.Mr Varadkar was speaking in terms of a ""no-deal Brexit"", while the UK government was responding in terms of reaching a deal. His ""planes would not fly"" remark could in theory become a reality if there was no deal, the need for which is tacitly implied in the UK statement. The Sun certainly took Mr Varadkar's comments as a threat, as did some unionist politicians in Northern Ireland. ""Given that the Irish State is dependent on the RAF for its air defence in the event of a terrorist attack it is obviously exceedingly unwise for  Varadkar to pompously and arrogantly suggest that Dublin could deny civilian aircraft from the UK access to Irish airspace,"" said Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister. DUP MLA Christopher Stalford countered that the Republic of Ireland gets its gas supply through the UK.Where the Republic of Ireland gets its gas from. Remember this the next time Leo decides to threaten the UK over airspace. pic.twitter.com/DR08JCtViNEnd of Twitter post  by @CStalfordMLA""Remember this the next time Leo decides to threaten the UK over airspace,"" he tweeted.In fact, the Republic of Ireland is on course to get the majority of its gas from Irish sources within the next few years.However Mr Varadkar was defended on social media by the Irish government's spokesperson on the EU""To be fair he merely reiterated a factual statement that Philip Hammond also made earlier this year,"" said Senator Neale Richmond. Eamonn Brennan, chief executive of the Irish Aviation Authority said as early as February 2017: ""Air connectivity all over the world is based on Air Service Agreements and once the UK leaves the EU a new Air Service Agreement will have to be put in place between the EU27 and the UK.Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair, has repeatedly warned that the UK is running out of time to agree a new open skies agreement with the EU, saying there is a ""real prospect"" that there will be no flights between the UK and Europe for a period beyond March 2019.In July 2017, the head of the Aerospace body ADS said that the UK must remain an EU member during a post-Brexit transition period.Aviation expert Paul Everitt said the UK would struggle to sign the necessary agreements with global safety regulators before then, risking disruption to air travel.""If we don't have a transition arrangement and if we aren't a member of the EU as part of that transitional arrangement, then we have chaos because we don't have a system to ensure that our products are safe and secure to fly and a regime that is acknowledged around the world,"" he said.Aviation consultant John Strickland said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the current aviation traffic rights framework would no longer apply.""Theoretically, at midnight on that day planes would be grounded,"" he said.But he questioned the likelihood of that happening. ""Even if technically a deal comes to an end it wouldn't be logical that you would just accept that that commercial airline traffic stops just to make a political point because you would be starving the economy,"" he added.""Whether you are on the UK side, or the Irish side, or the remain side, or the leave side… I don't see anybody that wins from the suspension of air services."""
2018-07-26,FOI failings,https://web.archive.org//web/20180727030717/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44864770,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMajor government departments are continuing to demonstrate persistent delays and unhelpfulness in their responses to information requests, according to research conducted by the BBC. Last June we reported on how the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Cabinet Office were frequently criticised by the Information Commissioner for their inadequate handling of FOI applications. Our analysis of decisions issued since then by the commissioner shows that the poor performance of these three departments has continued.The Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is being criticised by openness campaigners for not taking stronger action over the repeated failings. The Home Office has a particularly extreme record and has been rebuked by the Information Commissioner's Office in several dozen cases over the past 12 months.The ICO describes delays faced by requesters to the Home Office in various cases as ""unacceptable"", ""extremely lengthy"", ""particularly severe"" and ""inexplicable and unjustifiable"".In some instances the Home Office took several months to reach a decision and reply. In numerous other cases it failed to respond at all. The commissioner also reprimanded the Home Office over responses which were ""unhelpful"", showed ""poor handling"", ""did not provide any explanation"" or which contained a ""lack of detail"", ""no reasoning"", an ""extremely disappointing rationale"", or information which was ""not accurate"".Numerous ICO decision notices contain statements along the lines that the commissioner has made a record of the problem and that ""this issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases suggest that this is necessary"" or ""this may form evidence in future enforcement action against the HO should evidence from other cases suggest that there are systemic issues within the HO that are causing delays"".Since this is often repeated in the ICO decisions, it is not clear what further evidence of ""systemic issues"" ought to be required. The Ministry of Justice has also been frequently rebuked by the Commissioner for its failures to comply with the FOI law. The ICO criticises the ministry over delays which were ""very considerable"", ""far in excess of the requirement"", ""extremely lengthy"" and ""grossly excessive and entirely unacceptable"".As with the Home Office, there are numerous cases where the Ministry of Justice failed to send any response before the ICO's formal decision was issued. Similarly, many decision notices repeat the familiar statement that the failing has been noted and the issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases indicate there are systemic issues A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""We received nearly 5,000 FOI requests last year, one of the highest figures across Whitehall. We surpassed the ICO's high target for response times last year and have improved even further since - responding to 93% of requests on time in the latest figures.""The Cabinet Office also comes in for continuing criticism over its poor record on FOI.  This includes delays which were ""clearly against the spirit and intention of FOIA"", ""excessive"" and ""unacceptable"".It is also reprimanded for ""poorly conceived submissions"", lack of ""meaningful detail"", being ""illogical"", ""erroneous"", ""unsustainable"", providing ""generic"" arguments, handling which ""clearly fell short"", and having ""wrongly interpreted"" correspondence from a requester.This is despite the fact that the Cabinet Office is responsible for government FOI policy and should therefore set an example to other public authorities.Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information said that Elizabeth Denham should take stronger action: ""Departments have discovered that they can repeatedly ignore the regulator - and nothing happens. The solution is in the commissioner's hands. She should promptly serve chronic offenders with enforcement notices and threaten court action if they fail to comply.""She should also report the problem to Parliament and encourage a select committee to ask ministers in front of the TV cameras why they are treating the public's right to know with contempt.""An ICO spokesperson said: ""The ICO can take monitoring action if a public authority's performance needs to improve. Whether or not disclosure applies to a request is not always straightforward. That is why we work with departments to improve processes so decisions on what information can be released under FOI can be made more effectively and efficiently.""Requests to these departments which have been badly affected by delays include some submitted by myself and by BBC colleagues. The government departments involved have been approached for comment.Research by Patrick Cowling"
2018-07-26,Juncker vs Trump,https://web.archive.org//web/20180727030717/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44935473,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window""Trade tariffs are the greatest,"" President Donald Trump has declared before Wednesday's vital US-EU talks aimed at averting an all-out trade war.An ominous message for the head of the EU's executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, as he heads to Washington. Both sides have already slapped tariffs on billions of dollars of imports, but a lot more is at stake.At first glance the two men look like chalk and cheese but there are plenty of similarities.Both see themselves as consummate deal-makers with the personal touch. Neither is known for sticking to the scripts prepared by their advisers. Each has said that relations with Russia should be less confrontational. At the G7 summit in Canada, Donald Trump described European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker as ""a brutal killer"".  Mr Juncker replied that it was unusual for someone from Luxembourg to be treated as a threat. So the banter is flowing already. The EU and the US are embroiled in a trade war, although Brussels would never describe it that way. The US government has applied tariffs of 25% on imports of steel from the EU and 10% on aluminium, alleging that US national security is threatened.The EU retaliated with levies on American exports worth more than $3bn, including iconic items like bourbon, jeans and motorbikes. Now US authorities are considering hitting back with measures to limit imports of European-made cars. Inevitably President Trump explained it in a tweet:  ""If these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!""The EU thinks that the rationale for the American measures on aluminium and steel  - that it's all about national security - is ridiculous. A challenge has been lodged at the World Trade Organization. The European Commission has already sent the US authorities an 11-page document which argues that targeting European car companies would be counterproductive because 120,000 American jobs are directly reliant on them. And Brussels fears for the future of the rules-based order under President Trump, but you get the impression they quite enjoy playing the role of saviour of the system. It looks that way. President Trump recently described the European Union as ""a foe"". He sees the EU's trade surplus with the US as a problem. He relishes Brexit. And he really doesn't like the EU's ""tax lady"" - the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, who has repeatedly fined American tech firms millions and millions of euros. She has confirmed that she is a woman and she does work on tax, but that she doesn't have a problem with the USA specifically. The European Commission has said the trip is part of a ""dialogue"" designed to ""de-dramatise"" the situation. This is EU code for ""Don't expect too much.""At the start of hostilities, the EU dangled the prospect of a free trade deal that would slash tariffs on goods flowing between the US and Europe. That offer has been withdrawn because the EU does not like the idea of negotiating under threat. Jean-Claude Juncker has had to fend off allegations that he was drunk at a Nato summit after television cameras caught him struggling to walk. He said he was suffering a bout of the painful nerve condition, sciatica. His advisers asserted that his work wasn't affected and that he got on a plane to China the next day. Then there was a slightly weird interlude where Mr Juncker privately gave a false date of the Washington meeting to demonstrate that no-one in Brussels could keep a secret. ""And I was successful in that endeavour because the incorrect information was passed straight on to the press,"" he said at the EU leaders' summit in June. But this is a case where he is entitled to say he speaks for the whole European Union because trade is one of the areas where member states have handed control to Brussels.Before flying to Washington, Mr Juncker spoke to the leaders of France, Germany, the Netherlands and Austria.So far the 28 member states have stuck together, but everyone knows that US action on cars would hurt Germany the most, and EU countries have a habit of thinking of themselves rather than the European project when vital national interests are treated. Chancellor Angela Merkel has appealed for unity, saying ""the European Union will hopefully act as united again as it has done now"".But France's finance minister has already warned that the idea of solving the problem with a trade deal for cars poses a risk to the European automotive industry by opening it up to more global competition."

And the battle was not over Brexit but the Maastricht treaty. This was the agreement that turned the European Community into the European Union (EU) and laid the foundations for the European single currency, the euro.John Major had hailed the treaty, agreed in December 1991 by the then 12 member states, as a good deal for Britain. He praised the opportunities he believed a single market in goods and services, and the free movement of labour, offered. And he believed that a concession, allowing the UK to decide whether, not when, to join a single European currency, was key.Eurosceptic MPs said the treaty would give the EU greater powers at the expense of Westminster. They saw it as a step down the road to a centralised federal EU. And they were implacably opposed the UK joining a single European currency.In the Lords, the former Conservative Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher said that the treaty would ""diminish democracy and increase bureaucracy"".Lord Rees-Mogg went to court to stop the Maastricht treaty from becoming UK law - but judges supported the government's position, on all the issues. ""The outcome was even better than our lawyers had expected,"" Sir Roderic Lyne wrote on a note. He pointed out that Douglas Hurd, then Foreign Secretary, was ""exercising restraint"" in public as he did not want to ""provoke the Rees-Mogg brigade"" into ""further Quixotic action"".John Major enjoyed the moment. ""Good,"" he wrote on the document, ""a full gloat is merited.""Getting the treaty through the Commons took a year. Those who opposed it, from the Labour as well as Conservative benches, were vocal and well organised. But by July 1993 the end of the process was in sight.""It was the toughest time I spent in Downing Street,"" says Sir Roderic, who was John Major's private secretary at the time. ""I remember it as a nightmare.""John Major's strategy as the final vote loomed was a risky one. He would, if needed, call for a motion of confidence. If he had lost, the government would have fallen. It was, in effect, the ""nuclear option"" - either back me or face a general election.On 22 July 1993, after a series of close votes, the government lost the main motion. The ratification of the Maastricht treaty had been blocked.Then, in a moment of the highest political drama, John Major stood up at the dispatch box and announced there would be a vote of confidence in the government the following day, which would also act as a vote to write the treaty into UK law.Seeing all the papers reminds Sir Roderic of how much complex information the prime minister had to digest. ""John Major has an incredibly quick brain"" he says. ""He has a mind like a high-speed computer.""He recalls how on 21 July John Major had been depressed, knowing he had lost the first vote. He tried to work on a speech for the next day but lacked energy and went to bed. ""Everyone expected disaster,"" Sir Roderic says. Yet when he returned to Number 10 first thing next morning, the prime minister was ""perky"".""He had the glint of battle in his eye.""John Major had worked out his plan to call for confidence motion and had held three cabinet meetings to get his ministers to agree.His approach worked - opponents in his own party wouldn't vote against the government in a confidence vote. ""He basically lined the rebels up against a wall and aimed machine guns at them,"" as Sir Roderic puts it.The vote was won, by 339 to 299. John Major and his staff celebrated in his parliamentary office with champagne and congratulations arrived from European politicians. Albert Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, was friendly with Mr Major and sent a message saying: ""Well done.""Now keep your head down and drive on."" Sir Roderic Lyne is reluctant to draw too many parallels between then and now. ""Theresa May is unbelievably resilient I think,"" he says. ""Her problem is far worse than Major. He was attacked by 25 MPs. She's under fire from both right and left. And while for us, the real pressure came in the last stages, she's had it for two years."""
2018-07-26,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180727030717/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.

At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-26,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180727030717/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline?

The BBC understands that Mr Kurz has indicated he supports the idea of EU leaders holding formal Brexit talks at a summit in Salzburg in September.Mrs May hailed the strength of the UK's relationship with Austria, adding: ""We are delivering on a vote of the British people, they chose to leave the EU and we will deliver that."" Later, Mrs May pitched her idea for a post-Brexit free trade area to her Czech counterpart Andrej Babis.A Downing Street spokesman said: ""She highlighted that a UK-EU free trade area would maintain frictionless trade that would enable businesses across Europe to maintain their vital integrated supply chains.""They agreed it was important to find a solution and that negotiations should continue at pace.""Both the EU and UK say a deal can be done by October - five months before the UK is due to leave the European Union - but have also said preparations are being made in case negotiations end in no deal.Mr Barnier has already rejected a key element of her proposal for post-Brexit trade with the EU.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has accused the EU of pushing the UK towards a ""no deal"" scenario because they ""keep saying no to everything"".Mr Fox, who is on a trade mission to San Francisco, told Business Insider the UK should leave without a deal if talks break down, rather than requesting an extension of the Article 50 process to continue negotiations, as some have suggested.""To attempt to extend our membership even longer, many voters would regard as a complete betrayal by the political class, and I think they would be right,"" he added.Mrs May's trip to Austria is one of several being made to Europe by British government ministers over the summer to promote her plan, detailed in the Brexit White Paper, to European leaders.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met his German counterpart in Berlin on Monday and the UK chancellor, home secretary, business secretary and the minister for the Cabinet Office are also meeting counterparts across Europe over the summer.Following talks in Austria, Mrs May will head to Italy with her husband, Philip, for a week before returning to the UK to work. She is also due to attend a World War One memorial event marking the centenary of the battle of Amiens, which began on 8 August 1918, before heading off for two weeks' holiday in Switzerland.Analysis by BBC Diplomatic Correspondent James RobbinsSalzburg in high summer is packed with tourists and music lovers enjoying the annual festival.Theresa May went to the opera on Friday night, but only after her talks with Mr Kurz and Mr Babis.The prime minister is hoping to persuade them to urge others in the EU27 to relax their common position - particularly by accepting her proposals for continuing free movement of products after Brexit.But there's no sign either Austria or the Czech Republic is willing to budge. Eurosceptic feeling may be strong among their populations, but neither leader is contemplating following Britain out of the Union.  Instead, both governments believe Mrs May is still cherry-picking and that Britain must blink first to avoid what they call a catastrophic crash-out they are convinced would hurt the UK far more than the EU.Mozart's The Magic Flute, in the city of his birth, should have been something of a relief for Mrs May.The UK's Brexit White Paper, drawn up after agreement with the cabinet at Chequers, proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but Mrs May says it will end free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations.It would involve the UK collecting some EU tariffs - in a bid to ensure frictionless trade in goods and to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland - under its proposed Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-foods. The plan sparked two UK cabinet resignations - former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Mr Barnier said on Thursday that the EU ""will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules and VAT and excises duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU's governance structures"".Any customs arrangement or union ""must respect this principle"", he said.

2018-07-27,"Fake news a democratic crisis, MPs warn",https://web.archive.org//web/20180728050524/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44967650,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK faces a ""democratic crisis"" due to the spread of ""pernicious views"" and the manipulation of personal data, a parliamentary committee is set to warn.The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee has been investigating disinformation and fake news following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.In its first report it will suggest social media companies should face tighter regulation.It also proposes measures to combat election interference.The report warns that the ""relentless targeting of hyper-partisan views, which play to the fears and prejudices of people, in order to influence their voting plans"" is a threat to democracy.The committee's report was due to be officially published on Sunday.But a copy was published on Friday by Dominic Cummings, the director of the official Brexit campaign group Vote Leave, on his own blog. The committee suggests:1. Social media sites should be held responsible for 'harmful' content on their servicesCompanies such as Facebook and YouTube have repeatedly said they are just a ""platform"", rather than a ""publisher"". They have argued that they are not responsible for the content people post on their services.""Social media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a 'platform', claiming that they are tech companies and have no role themselves in regulating the content of their sites,"" the committee said.""They continually change what is and is not seen on their sites, based on algorithms and human intervention.""They reward what is most engaging, because engagement is part of their business model and their growth strategy. They have profited greatly by using this model.""The committee suggested a ""new category of tech company"" should be created, which was ""not necessarily a platform or a publisher"" but something in between.This should establish ""clear legal liability for the tech companies to act against harmful and illegal content on their platforms,"" the report said.2. The rules on political campaigns should be made fit for the digital ageThe committee said electoral law needed to be ""updated to reflect changes in campaigning techniques"".It suggested:3. Technology companies should be taxed to fund education and regulationIncreased regulation of social media sites would result in more work for organisations such as the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The committee suggested a levy on tech companies should fund the expanded responsibilities of the regulators.The money should also be spent on educational programmes and a public information campaign, to help people identify disinformation and fake news.4. Social networks should be auditedThe committee warned that fake accounts on sites such as Facebook and Twitter ""not only damage the user experience, but potentially defraud advertisers"".It suggested an independent authority such as the Competition and Markets Authority should audit the social networks.It also said security mechanisms and algorithms used by social networks should be available for audit by a government regulator, to ensure they are ""operating responsibly"".The report was very critical of Facebook, which has been under increased scrutiny following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.""Facebook has hampered our efforts to get information about their company throughout this inquiry. It is as if it thinks that the problem will go away if it does not share information about the problem, and reacts only when it is pressed,"" the report said.""It provided witnesses who have been unwilling or unable to give full answers to the committee's questions.""The committee repeated its call for Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence.The report also summarised the evidence collected during the committee's inquiry into disinformation, fake news and election interference.Whistleblower Christopher Wylie and Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix were among the 61 witnesses that gave evidence.The report said that Vote Leave campaign manager Dominic Cummings had refused to appear before the committee. But Mr Cummings called the report ""fake news"" when he published the leaked copy on Friday.The committee added that it had received ""disturbing evidence"" - some of which it had not published - of hacking, disinformation and voter suppression in elections. ""We urge the government to ensure that the National Crime Agency thoroughly investigates these allegations.""The committee's final report is expected before the end of the year.Facebook and Twitter have yet to respond to a request for comment."

Labour activists in the south London constituency are angry about Ms Hoey's support for Brexit in an area that voted strongly for Remain and for voting with the government earlier this month on an amendment to the Trade Bill, a key piece of Brexit legislation. The no-confidence motion, which received unanimous backing at a party meeting on Thursday, says defeat in that Commons vote could have toppled the government and led to a general election that Labour was ""widely expected to win"".The motion also accuses Ms Hoey of ""reneging"" on Labour's manifesto pledge to oppose Theresa May's approach to Brexit and of ""colluding"" with then UKIP leader Nigel Farage during the EU referendum campaign.  It also attacks her backing of causes ""not compatible with Labour core beliefs"" such as fox hunting, ""elitist grammar schools"", and her chairmanship of the Countryside Alliance.The MP, who is currently in Zimbabwe as an election observer, has represented Vauxhall since 1989.She defended herself in a letter to local party members ahead of Thursday's vote.""The idea there would have been a general election if Labour MPs had supported the amendment is not true,"" she said.The amendment, tabled by pro-EU Tory backbenchers, ""was a backhand way of staying in the customs union,"" she argued, and ""this was not the position in the Labour manifesto on which I was re-elected"".In a statement to the Guardian, Ms Hoey said the result of the no-confidence vote was ""not a surprise"".""My local party activists are solid EU Remainers,"" she told the newspaper. ""I will always put my country before my party and helping my constituents is a priority. ""After 29 years as an MP I am quite relaxed about the vote and it won't influence in any way how I vote in future.""Earlier this week, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said he was seeking to persuade Ms Hoey and three other Labour rebels to stop ""propping up"" the government in key Brexit votes."

""As these proceedings are now ongoing, I will be making no further comment on the matter"".On Thursday she tweeted her thanks to those who had sent her ""messages of support, love and prayers on my behalf"".Mr Onasanya, of Cambridge, is jointly charged with his sister on the two counts she faces relating to incidents on 24 July 2017 and 23 August 2017.The charges allege they intended to pervert the course of justice by driving a vehicle in excess of the speed limit, falsely informing the investigating authorities that a third party had been the driver and enabling them, as a consequence, to avoid such prosecution and punishment.During the July incident, Ms Onasanya is alleged to have been driving - and during the August incident, her brother is alleged to have been driving.The single count that Mr Onasanya faces relates to an incident on 17 June 2017.A Labour Party spokesman said: ""It would not be appropriate to comment on an ongoing case.""Ms Onasanya, who was a solicitor before her election, is a Labour whip, meaning she is responsible for party discipline."
2018-07-27,Targeted pro-Brexit Facebook ads revealed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180728050524/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44966969,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe official Vote Leave campaign spent more than £2.7m on targeting ads at specific groups of people on Facebook - helping it to win the 2016 EU referendum.The US social media giant has now released these ads to a committee of MPs investigating fake news - meaning everyone, not just those they were originally aimed at, can now see them.The ads, created by Canadian company Aggregate AIQ, often focused on specific issues - such as immigration or animal rights - thought likely to push the buttons of certain groups of people, based on their age, where they lived and other personal data taken from social media and other sources.The 120 pages of documents appear to back up the findings of the Electoral Commission, which ruled last week that Vote Leave broke electoral law by working jointly with another campaign, BeLeave - something denied by both groups.A number of BeLeave ads were sent from the Vote Leave Facebook account, including this one:There are 1,433 different messages in the data set released by Facebook, all with one common theme - although it is not always clear that they have come from a pro-Brexit campaign.Here is one that was targeted at animal lovers:This one, targeted at tea-lovers, is more obviously pro-Brexit:Polar bears were also recruited to the cause:The adverts contained in the Facebook data set were seen more than 169 million times in total. The BeLeave messages were more closely directed at younger voters, promising a ""brighter future"" if the UK could stop ""EU regulators keeping us in the past"" and accusing Brussels of regulating ride-sharing apps such as Uber and enforcing quotas on data streaming.Data provided by Facebook suggests some of the most seen images were produced by BeLeave. This image was displayed on the screens of target audience members more than five million times: Older voters tended to be treated to claims about how much money the UK was sending to the EU. More than 140 ads made reference to the controversial claim that £350m a week sent to the EU could be spent on the NHS instead:Alternative uses for the £350m included schools and flood defences: Vote Leave made the most of then US President Barack Obama's intervention in the referendum campaign, when he said the UK would be at the ""back of the queue"" for trade deals.This ad was heavily targeted at older voters, with a reach of up to 25% among woman aged over 65 and 23% of men in that age group targeted by one version of it (as with many of the ads, the accompanying text was tweaked and refined from a basic ""parent"" ad):Immigration was another common theme, with one ad appearing to suggest the entire Turkish population was headed for the UK: Boris Johnson was the only politician to be pictured in the ads:Apart from one featuring Jeremy Corbyn, which was targeted at younger voters and accompanied by an old quote from the Labour leader: ""The EU takes away from national parliaments the power to set economic policy and hands it over to an unelected set of bankers.""Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party spent £32,750.73 with AIQ on pro-Brexit Facebook ads. Only 16 of the ads were delivered to users in Northern Ireland, according to the Facebook data. The remaining 24 were primarily seen by people in England.The 24 adverts, seen at least 1.96 million times - and potentially as many as 4.2 million times - were all posted in the final three days of the EU referendum campaign.Early on in the campaign, Vote Leave launched a giant data harvesting exercise through a competition to win £50m if you could correctly guess the result of all 51 games in the 2016 European football championship.The odds of winning the contest - which Vote Leave funded through an insurance policy - were calculated at one in 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. It was described by one Vote Leave insider at the time as a potential ""game changer"" because it would allow it to gather the contact details of thousands of potential voters, many of whom would not normally be interested in the referendum.The campaign recruited former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham to promote the contest:A separate group called Veterans for Britain had refused permission for its ads to be passed on, said Facebook.The Culture Media and Sport Committee is expected shortly to publish interim findings from its inquiry into fake news, which has taken evidence from whistleblower Christopher Wylie and technology company bosses as well as representatives of the separate Leave.EU campaign.Correction 27 July 2018: An earlier version of this story said some ads were seen by fewer than 1,000 people, according to the Facebook data, and this was an example of ""micro-targeting"". But former Vote Leave chief, Matthew Elliott, said the ads never ran, so we removed that reference."
2018-07-27,What now for the government?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180728050524/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44954369,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWestminster made it to the summer, just. It was messy, sweaty, with an almost daily roll call of nightmares for the government. Senior MPs say privately there were genuine moments, even last week, when various colleagues - not the usual suspects - were agitating to try to remove the prime minister. The government lost an important vote, but scraped through a vital one. The chief whip got caught out with some epic skulduggery. Big cabinet bruisers walked out, trashing the main government policy as they did.As the temperature rose, so did tempers. One senior MP told me that some significant Conservative backers were discussing withholding their next donations to the party because they were so unhappy at how Number 10 has been handling things. There have been plenty of moments of ""it can't go on like this"". But, ""it"" can, and it normally does.After the summer break then, when the prime minister will hope everyone in her party has calmed down, rather than plotted on WhatsApp from their sun loungers, how does the government ""go on like this""? What are the ways through? The first thing to say is that no country has left the European Union before like this. So there is no precedent. There is no map. Whether you find it deeply thrilling, or deeply alarming, ask even those who have held some of the highest offices in the land what happens if it all goes wrong and they don't know. There are, though, scenarios that can be sketched out.This might be fantasy but it's not impossible. Say Theresa May manages to get the EU to broker something on the basis of her latest plan and comes back with what one of her longstanding allies describes as ""Chequers minus minus"". There will likely have to be concessions on giving the EU more cash and more concessions on immigration, but it is a just about swallowable deal. It won't have escaped your notice by now that warnings about ""no deal"" are coming thick and fast, and ever more scarily, from ministers' mouths. This is no coincidence. It is not beyond the wit of man to see that stoking concern about ""no deal"" could, conveniently, encourage MPs to feel they have little choice but to vote for it. However, it is abundantly clear that there is a solid core of Brexiteer Tories who simply would not vote for it. And you can near as dammit be sure that Labour's official position won't be to back the government. One of the Labour leadership team told me: ""We will push her to the brink."" Don't underestimate either the concern that could spread far and wide about whether a deal like that would really be what people had voted for. So far, Number 10's analysis that the majority of people just want the prime minister to get on with Brexit and are not paying huge attention has been shown to be more or less right (not withstanding very vocal groups on either side of the debate). The dynamics of the actual deal might well change that.  But in Parliament, senior backers of Mrs May know that to get the vote through they'd have to rely on many Labour MPs either abstaining or voting with the government. If rejecting the deal feels like opening Pandora's box versus supporting a fudgey compromise, there could well be enough of them to allow Mrs May to squeak through. Maybe. And then, maybe, Europe will go back to being just another issue, albeit an important one.We will be in the EU departure lounge for a couple of years. Trade talks will be tricky, there will be plenty to sort out - but a deal will have been done and the government can, in theory, tell the public we are out, and life can get back to something approaching normal. Hmmm.It's also possible to see how the government does not even get that far. Right now, it seems the prime minister is absolutely intent on getting a deal. Those who know her well (it's not a long list!) say that is what is driving her above all else - getting something done. The mantra ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" has not aged well.But if the further concessions that the rest of the EU demands, for demand they will, are just too intense, requiring too much on immigration, or extra payments, forcing the prime minister not just to pinken her red lines but to scrub them out altogether, then maybe that could change and she could walk away. Right now it seems unlikely, but the chances of no deal have been rising. One diplomat, in sorrow more than anger, last week said to me he simply couldn't see how the EU would be able to offer anything that the prime minister could get through Parliament. Yes, anything that is viable at all.But if there is ""no deal"", and the government actually puts that on the table, it is hard to see Parliament backing that either. Many Tories, including many in government, are talking about when, not if, they make it plain that they would never support leaving without concluding an agreement. Those discussions are taking place, including among some serving ministers. What some Brexiteers have always wanted - a simple free trade deal - does find supporters around the EU. Indeed, one well-placed official suggested to me that if the White Paper wasn't coherent or workable, and the jury is very much out on that, then the EU could simply say in October, it's a basic deal on trade or nothing. Some Brexiteers would rejoice. But that would also have to come with the backstop to prevent a hard border in Ireland, which right now, despite all sorts of ideas being floated, is still a huge obstacle to getting a deal done. The prime minister says she simply couldn't sign up to it. And until there is a shift - or a magical solution - that way through the quagmire is out of reach. And indeed, if it becomes obvious in the autumn that the prime minister wants to sign something that is even more of a compromise than Chequers, then her nemesis, the Eurosceptics, might try to oust her well before she gets to bring the deal to Parliament. Then we are properly in a land where anything is possible. The Article 50 process is a legal mechanism, with a fixed deadline. But if the ruling party crashed into a leadership contest? If there was no one to negotiate with? Who knows? Could that mean a general election? Perhaps, a second referendum? Not out of the question. The People's Vote campaign pushing for this are stepping up their activities - not just in Westminster but around the country. By the time we sign off next summer, the government could have just navigated its way through the most complicated and troublesome political waters in decades. Or there could be a new prime minister, and the Conservative Party might have actually succeeded in smashing itself to bits. It will be 13 years then since David Cameron vowed the Tories would ""stop banging on about Europe"". It seems deeply optimistic to imagine that by then, they will have been able to move on. I, however, for the next few weeks won't be banging on about anything. It's the political holidays. Thank you for reading this page through another epic political year, and I'll see you on the other side when, the only thing I am really sure of, there will be plenty more to discuss. "
2018-07-27,Private probation contracts to end early,https://web.archive.org//web/20180728050524/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44973258,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPrivate companies that run probation services are to have their government contracts ended early - after MPs said the system for supervising criminals was in a ""mess"".The contracts began in 2015 to manage low-risk offenders in England and Wales, under a partial privatisation by then-Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.Ministers are proposing further changes and private firms will remain involved.But Labour said the costly contracts had created an  ""unprecedented crisis"".It comes after the Commons justice committee said in July that changes to probation had failed, and it was unconvinced private sector firms could ever deliver an effective service.BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the government had hoped that shaking up probation would result in less reoffending. The number of people reoffending has reduced slightly, but those that do are committing crimes more frequently.  The arrangements for managing offenders were overhauled in 2014, with the probation service split in two. A new state body, the National Probation Service (NPS), was set up to supervise high-risk offenders, with 21 privately run Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) supervising low and medium-risk offenders.But David Gauke, who became justice secretary in January, said that while the £3.7bn Transforming Rehabilitation (TR) programme had been ambitious and innovative, several CRCs had made ""very substantial losses"".Mr Gauke said the amount of work available for the CRCs had been ""lower than anticipated and that has had an impact in terms of their income and the services they are able to provide"".He also said he was determined to have a service that reduced reoffending, and could oversee ""tough"" community sentences with less reliance on ""ineffective"" short prison terms.Existing contracts will now end two years early, in 2020 - and will be replaced with 10 new ones under changes that will cost the government £170m. This includes £110m that the CRCs owe the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) in fines for failing to meet performance targets - but which they will be allowed to reinvest in services to keep them going for the last two years of their agreements.The MoJ will also pay £46m over the next two years for services that help offenders immediately after they are released from prison.The MoJ said it had budgeted to pay firms £2.5bn by 2020 but had only paid out £2.2bn - a saving of £300m - because less work than anticipated was allocated to the CRCs.This was because there was an increase in the proportion of serious offences which they were ineligible to work on.Mr Gauke said new contracts would make better use of offending data and would move towards ""payment for services delivered"", but he ruled out allowing CRCs to take on high-risk cases.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said: ""This decision to throw more good money after bad and the government's re-commitment to a privately-run probation service shows that the Conservatives have run out of all ideas on how to fix their broken system."" And the GMB union said the probation officers it represented were overworked and demoralised. GMB national officer George Georgiou said: ""Fragmenting the service has moved us away from a coherent national workforce strategy for the entire probation service.""But the government's proposals were welcomed by the chief probation inspector, Dame Glenys Stacey.Dame Glenys, who was critical of probation services in her report in December, said: ""There is much to welcome in these proposals, and we are pleased to see that our inspection evidence and findings and our wider advice have had significant influence and impact."""
2018-07-27,UK halts co-operation with US over 'Beatles' duo,https://web.archive.org//web/20180728050524/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44973586,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK has suspended co-operation with the US over two Islamic State suspects.Ministers had said they would share intelligence with the US that could lead to the men's conviction, without opposing a death penalty sentence.However the mother of one of the men has now launched a legal challenge to prevent such information sharing.The Home Office has halted co-operation until a judge has had a chance to consider an application for judicial review.Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, both of whom have been stripped of British nationality, are wanted for being part of the IS kidnap gang behind hostage executions. They are accused of being the last two members of an IS group dubbed ""The Beatles"" because of their British accents. Lawyers for the mother of El Shafee Elsheikh have now prepared detailed grounds challenging Mr Javid's decision to share information with the US without a death penalty assurance - meaning a case could be before High Court judges in days. They said the home secretary's actions revealed ""a clear and dramatic departure from the UK's long standing international and domestic commitment to oppose the continuing exercise of the death penalty.""A Home Office spokesperson said the government had ""agreed to a short-term pause"" but was confident it had ""acted in full accordance of the law"".The two men are currently being held by Kurdish forces and the UK believes it cannot legally extradite them to face trial here.  This week it emerged that the US was preparing the ground to prosecute the men itself - and that it had asked the UK for information that would help convict them.  In a letter leaked to the Daily Telegraph, Home Secretary Sajid Javid wrote that the UK would not oppose the use of the death penalty if the two men were extradited to the US.In the past Britain has sought assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used in cases where the UK provided information or extradited suspects.Number 10 had said this was ""a long-standing position"" to oppose the death penalty but added that in this case it was ""a priority to make sure that these men face criminal prosecution"".Analysis by BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic CascianiThe home secretary's position boils down to a simple question: Would you run the risk of them going free? Given Elsheikh and Kotey are in the custody of Syrian Kurdish forces, that sounds unlikely. But British prosecutors can't bring the men for trial here because they're not being held by a recognised state with whom the UK has a legally recognised extradition agreement - it would amount to kidnap.The forces holding the men are, however, backed by the US - and American courts are less fussy about the legalities of how a suspect ends up in the dock. The US may need British information to make a prosecution stick - hence the co-operation. This challenge from Mr Elsheikh's mother isn't about that evidence - but whether the ministerial decision to share it demolishes the UK's internationally recognised opposition to capital punishment. In case after case down the years, the UK has refused to provide legal help that could lead to overseas executions.So this decision to help the Americans, made in the hope of landing a conviction of two of the most wanted men in the world, could turn into a major legal fight. Labour accused the UK of having ""unilaterally abandoned"" its opposition to the death penalty.The former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Lord Carlile said this constituted ""a unilateral change of policy without any consultation"".The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said a senior British government official told him that this case was not the first time that the UK had dropped its request for assurances that the death penalty would not be used.But our correspondent said if the pair were sent to the controversial US military prison Guantanamo Bay - where suspects have been detained without trial - the UK would withhold intelligence."

The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March next year.The People's Vote campaign is hoping to get enough MPs, including the Labour leadership, to back a referendum on the deal Theresa May strikes with Brussels, which is due to be put to a vote in Parliament in October.In a statement backing the People's Vote campaign, he said: ""I am not a politician but I know when something is going wrong and right now Brexit feels like it is going very wrong indeed.""He said politicians seemed ""unable to resolve the problem"" the EU referendum had given them.Lineker has been critical of Brexit on social media in recent times, attracting claims of bias from Brexit supporters.  Critics have also pointed to a Twitter message he sent a year ago, which said ""Can't find the bit in my tweet where I ask for another referendum. Leave won. Get over it.""Replying to those comments, Lineker tweeted he was ""happy to admit I've now changed my mind"", adding that he did not envisage ""at the time that we'd ever contemplate a 'no deal Brexit' and the ensuing carnage that would bring"".A spokesman for the BBC said: ""Gary is not involved in any news or political output for the BBC and as such any expression of his personal political views does not affect the BBC's impartiality.""Senior Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who campaigned for Brexit in the referendum, was asked about Lineker's comments on ITV's Good Morning Britain.He said: ""I hesitate to criticise any individual - they're entitled to their opinion - but he's only one individual and during the referendum there were lots of stars and people who came out and endorsed this or the other, but people made up their own minds.""On the idea of MPs deciding to call a fresh referendum, he said that although most MPs had been for Remain in the 2016 vote, ""they have to accept the result... this will be a crisis for our democracy if the British people are ignored""."

He told BBC Scotland: ""Now that we're going into restructuring, we'd like to have a board with more knowledge and understanding about the technology element of media rather than a public figurehead.""The digital entrepreneur began to push the board last October, but stopped when he found a ""poison pill"" defence against hostile takeovers - a clause in bond-funding that would hand the company to lenders if the board were to be ousted.The company publishes the 'i', The Scotsman, Scotland on Sunday, the Yorkshire Post and about 200 local titles.It faces the risk of default on £220m of bonds, due for repayment in less than a year. It has been trying for months to reach a deal with the bond-holders.Mr Ager-Hanssen's recent renewed interest in the company, as reported in the business press, was followed by a sudden spike in its share price on Thursday morning.From a low of 3p, which valued the whole company at less than £3m, it trebled in price during the day, before settling back to 6p - 72% above its opening price.Mr Ager-Hanssen told BBC Scotland that it was not his company, Custos Group, that was trading the shares.He has written to the board, saying he would like to open talks.He said: ""We don't have any dialogue, but my intention is to get that dialogue going and get some insight into that information about the company.""In response to the price increase, Johnston Press issued a statement to say it was aware of no reason why the surge had taken place. It added: ""The company continues to explore a number of strategic options for the restructuring or refinancing of its bonds and confirms that no agreement on these potential options has been reached.""The statement continued: ""The company received a letter from Custos Group on Friday 20 July, and notes the press commentary on this over recent days.""The company confirms that it is not in receipt of any plan or proposal from any party for a refinancing or restructuring of its debt. Further announcements will be made as appropriate.  ""As stated previously, any proposal that results from these discussions will remain subject to negotiation and consent of relevant stakeholders, and there can be no certainty that a formal proposal will be forthcoming.""Mr Salmond, who lost his Westminster seat in 2017's general election, said in November he would take on the role if plans led by Mr Ager-Hanssen were approved by shareholders, but added that he would not have editorial control.Mr Salmond said the papers would be ""a champion of the community of interests they represent"".Since losing his parliamentary seat, Mr Salmond has hosted a chat show at the Edinburgh Fringe and a weekly radio programme on LBC. In November, he started hosting a talk show on the Russian state-funded broadcaster RT.Responding to the latest development, Mr Salmond described the article as a ""silly season"" story.He said: ""Mr Ager-Hanssen, as major shareholder in Johnston Press, is now focused on restructuring the ailing group rather than changing the board. ""I wish him luck in what will be a very hard task."""
2018-07-27,Medical cannabis products to be legalised,https://web.archive.org//web/20180728050524/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44968386,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSpecialist doctors in the UK will be able to legally prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products by autumn, the home secretary has announced.Those that meet safety and quality standards are to be made legal for patients with an ""exceptional clinical need"", Sajid Javid said.As it is a devolved matter, it will require legislative change before it is enforced in Northern Ireland.Legalisation follows high-profile cases involving severely epileptic children.Many had previously been denied access to cannabis oil.Others forms of cannabis will remain illegal.Mr Javid's decision was made after the chief medical officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies, and the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said patients with certain medical conditions should be given access to the treatments.Their advice was part of a review into medicinal cannabis launched by the home secretary following an outcry over Billy Caldwell and Alfie Dingley being denied access to cannabis oil.The parents of the boys, who have rare forms of epilepsy, say it controls their seizures. The Home Office recently granted them licences to access the treatments. Mr Javid said: ""Recent cases involving sick children made it clear to me that our position on cannabis-related medicinal products was not satisfactory.  ""That is why we launched a review and set up an expert panel to advise on licence applications in exceptional circumstances.""This will help patients with an exceptional clinical need but is in no way a first step to the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use.""Billy Caldwell's mother, Charlotte, said Mr Javid's announcement had been made on her son's 13th birthday.""For the first time in months I'm almost lost for words, other than 'thank you Sajid Javid',"" she said. ""Never has Billy received a better birthday present, and never from somebody so unexpected...""But, crucially, my little boy Billy can now live a normal life with his mummy because of the simple ability to now administer a couple of drops a day of a long-maligned but entirely effective natural medication.""A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""The rescheduling of cannabis-derived medicinal products is a devolved matter and requires legislative change.""The Department of Health notes the advice provided by experts during the two-part review commissioned by the Home Secretary.  ""Consideration will be given to rescheduling cannabis-derived medicinal products in Northern Ireland in line with the rest of the UK ""In the interim, clinicians may still apply to the Home Office Expert Panel should they wish to use a cannabis-based medicine in the treatment of a patient."" Cannabis is classed as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning it is judged to have no therapeutic value but can be used for the purposes of research with a Home Office licence.The decision by the Home Office will put certain cannabis-derived products into Schedule 2 - those that have a potential medical use - and will place them in the same category as cocaine and heroin, among other drugs. The Department for Health and Social Care and the Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will now develop a clear definition of what constitutes a cannabis-derived medicinal product so they can be rescheduled and prescribed, the Home Office said. In the meantime, clinicians will still be able to apply to an independent expert panel on behalf of patients wishing to access these products. The home secretary said licence fees for applications made to the panel will be waived, and those already granted will not be charged.The home secretary's decision was welcomed by campaigners and health experts.Donna Kinnair, from the Royal College of Nursing, said the decision was ""very welcome"".Dr Tom Freeman, senior academic fellow at King's College London, said Mr Javid's decision would have a ""substantial impact on research by facilitating the development of safer and more effective medicines"".Former justice minister Sir Mike Penning, who was among those appealing for Alfie Dingley to be given a special licence for medicinal cannabis, welcomed the announcement but said there were still unanswered questions about which treatments would be rescheduled.""Any move to restrict medical cannabis in the UK to a very narrow range of derived products, each requiring full pharmaceutical trials, thereby blocking out the many products available overseas, will lead to great disappointment and be a missed opportunity.""

The EU plans to buy more US liquefied natural gas (LNG) and soybeans.A joint statement said the two leaders agreed to ""work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods"".US import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium, imposed in March, will however remain in place.Obviously the European Union, as represented by @JunckerEU and the United States, as represented by yours truly, love each other! pic.twitter.com/42ImacgCN0End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrumpA working group of senior advisers will meet to facilitate trade and lower barriers. The two sides pledged to refrain from new trade restrictions during those negotiations.A full-blown trade war had been looming, fuelled by the tariffs introduced by Mr Trump.EU-US relations had been further frayed by Mr Trump's tributes to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his attacks on Nato and the EU.Mr Trump's language after meeting Mr Juncker was enthusiastic, in contrast with the angry tone he adopted previously towards the EU, calling it a ""foe"" on trade.Mr Trump has come under pressure domestically because of retaliatory tariffs imposed on US goods by China, the EU, Canada and Mexico.US chipmaker Qualcomm Inc appeared to be the latest casualty of the trade row with China. It dropped a $44bn (£33.5bn) bid to take over NXP Semiconductors, after China failed to give approval for it. On Tuesday the Trump administration announced up to $12bn in aid for US farmers hurt by the Chinese tariffs.Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump declared a ""new phase in the relationship"" between the US and the EU, calling it a ""very big day for free and fair trade"".Mr Juncker thanked the president and hailed a ""constructive meeting"".Mr Trump said the EU would become a ""massive buyer"" of US liquefied natural gas and the joint statement said EU imports of LNG would increase, to diversify Europe's energy supply.Mr Trump has condemned Germany's project to expand imports of Russian natural gas, via a new Baltic pipeline.""The EU is going (...) to buy a lot of soybeans from our farmers, primarily in the Midwest,"" Mr Trump said.Adam Fleming, BBC News, BrusselsEU officials have been giving more details of the deal brokered in Washington. The working group will investigate long-term ways to reduce tariffs on industrial goods - not cars or agricultural products - and how to bring down the extra tariffs on steel and aluminium recently applied by US authorities. It will report at the end of November - after the midterm elections in the US. The pledge to buy more American soybeans is actually a promise not to interfere in market forces that mean the EU is buying more anyway. ""We are not turning into a Soviet-style economy,"" said an official. And this is not a revival of the controversial TTIP trade pact between the EU and US or a big free trade agreement. That would take much longer and would require the consent of the EU member states. The pair also agreed to work towards reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Mr Trump accuses the WTO of treating the US unfairly - though mostly the US has won in arbitration cases there.Mr Juncker said striking a deal on zero tariffs on industrial goods was his ""main intention"". ""I had one intention today, to make a deal, and we made a deal. We have a number of areas on which to work together,"" he said.No announcement was made on car tariffs, and it was not clear whether any progress had been made on resolving the issue. Mr Trump had threatened to impose 25% import tariffs on European cars.On Twitter, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said the two were ""turning a page"" on trade, while German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier hailed it as a ""breakthrough"". Congrats to @JunckerEU, @realDonaldTrump: Breakthrough achieved that can avoid trade war &  save millions of jobs! Great for global economy!End of Twitter post  by @peteraltmaierGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tweeted (in German): ""Juncker showed in Washington that it's really not about who tweets most aggressively, but about whether one offers real solutions. Because Trump's grassroots also feels that it only loses when we impose more and more senseless tariffs on each other.""French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed the agreement, but called for ""clarifications"". He said there was no point trying to clinch any major trade deal with the US. Agriculture must be excluded, he said, because Europe could not compromise on food safety and environmental standards.Mr Trump scorned the proposed EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which stalled two years ago. But his ""deal"" with Mr Juncker echoes some of TTIP's ambition.A former US Ambassador to the EU, Anthony Gardner, made that point in a tweet.Idea of significantly more LNG shipments to EU absurd. It is not price competitive with piped gas. In TTIP we had already agreed to eliminate 97pc of tariffs including all industrial tariffs — nothing new there though Trump of course will take credit. https://t.co/a2Z49cA239End of Twitter post  by @tonylgardner"

But many people do not fit neatly into either category, throwing up complex and unexpected dilemmas for both the Home Office and the individuals concerned.Some, such as Ursula Crosby, who contacted the BBC with her story, have been unable to get a clear answer about how to secure residency rights, and citizenship, when Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Ms Crosby retired to Portugal five years ago after 40 years of working as a physiotherapist in NHS hospitals, in London and Shrewsbury. She says she felt like spreading her wings and ""doing something a bit different"" while she could.She is a German citizen but under free movement rules she had the security of knowing she could return to the UK, where her daughter lives and where she still owns property, when she wanted to.Brexit has changed that. The UK has told EU citizens they will be able to apply for ""settled status"" if they have been living in the UK for five years or have been granted indefinite leave to remain. It is unclear how this will apply to Ms Crosby, who was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 1979. Indefinite leave to remain - despite the name - usually expires if you have left the country for two years or more, as is the case with Ms Crosby. She has received conflicting advice from UK officials about whether she would qualify for settled status and no-one has been able to tell her what will happen if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. For all the government's assurances about how easy it will be for EU citizens after Brexit, getting a straight answer on all but the most straightforward of cases is very difficult, if the experience of researching this article is anything to go by.At one point, Ms Crosby was referred to an independent immigration adviser, who told her she would be all right because Britain would probably stay in the European Economic Area after Brexit - which would be news to Prime Minister Theresa May, who has repeatedly ruled that out.She is now torn between selling up and moving back to the UK before Britain leaves the EU in March, or risking moving back at a later date, during the 21-month transition period that will follow Brexit, in the hope that she can still secure settled status.""I am sure I could live in Germany but I wouldn't really want to live in Germany,"" says the 68-year-old. ""I no longer have any connections there, as such. My parents are dead. I have a cousin in Germany. ""I could stay in Portugal but I am not sure I would want to. It was never my intention to and I still have property in England.""If I ask anybody who meets me, they all think I am British.""She first came to the UK in 1971, on a work permit, long before EU free movement rules came into force, and was married to a British man for many years.She now regrets not applying for British citizenship when she had the chance but, like many others, she did not think she needed to.""There are probably quite a lot of people in this situation,"" says immigration lawyer Colin Yeo, ""people that used to live in the UK, perhaps for a very long time, who were assuming they would be able to come back to the UK because it is a member of the EU.""They will probably be all right if they come back during the transition period.""But, he adds, many will feel ""they have got to come back now or they will lose the chance"". Ms Crosby says she can't understand why, as someone in receipt of a full UK state pension, as well as an NHS pension, she may have to wait five years after returning to the UK to qualify for British citizenship, the same as someone from an EU country who has never lived there.""I am an honest person, I have no convictions, I paid my taxes and if I go back I will be able to support myself. Am I doing any harm?"" she says.The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases, but a spokeswoman said: ""After we leave the EU, in March 2019, there will be an implementation period that ends on 31 December 2020, during which EU citizens and their family members will be free to live, work and study in the UK as they do now. ""EU citizens and their family members who become resident in the UK during the implementation period will be able to make an application to the EU Settlement Scheme and be eligible for temporary leave to remain and, after five years' lawful residence, settled status, under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement. ""The rights of those EU citizens arriving during the implementation period will be safeguarded on the same terms as has been agreed for those EU citizens resident in the UK before we leave the EU.""Ms Crosby remains unconvinced by the Home Office's reassurances - and she has written to the department to try to get some clear guidance on what she should do next.""I am not sure I can rely on the immigration system to relax their very inflexible rules,"" she says.""My worst fear is that I sell up here, move back to England and then find out that it would not have been necessary."""

What's happened in the opinion polls and what can they tell us about what could happen when Parliament returns in the autumn?Please enable Javascript to view our poll tracker.In the first six months of 2018 the Westminster voting intention opinion polls were rather dull. But since the cabinet awayday at Chequers on 6 July, and the publication of the government's Brexit white paper the following week, there has been a marked change.For months the polls only moved very gradually. Between January and the beginning of July support for Labour dipped a couple of percentage points whilst the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats went up by about one per cent each.That did mean the Tories were fairly reliably in the lead, but only narrowly. Then came Chequers - and the calm of the first half of the year came to an abrupt end.The Conservatives have seen their rating fall back. In a couple of polls they've been at 36%, their lowest level since last year's general election.As a result, Labour has moved ahead in a sequence of polls for the first time since February.The other beneficiaries of the Conservative drop are UKIP. Until Chequers they'd not topped 5% this year. They've been above that in each of the last five published polls.None of this should be exaggerated. The movements aren't massive. But after months where changes happened at a snail's pace, it's a striking development.It could yet turn out that this is just a blip. The absence of warring Conservative MPs from Westminster might see the public's view of the party improve. But if it is a blip, it's a pretty big one.And it potentially foreshadows further turbulence in the autumn when Theresa May and the EU hope to finalise a Brexit deal.To see how difficult the prime minister's task is on Brexit just look at polls about it.Voters remain pretty evenly split about whether it was a good decision.We've seen a continuation of the trend from 2017. Over time, the number of people who say that Brexit was the wrong decision has very gradually increased, but there's no sign of a consensus forming.Worse still for the prime minister, polls which seek to capture what people think should happen next suggest an even more divided public.An interesting poll by new polling firm Deltapoll asked precisely that question: According to this poll, there's no course of action which has the support of even a third of voters. That could cause problems for Theresa May. It's going to be very hard for her to please a majority of the public whatever she does."

The Sun said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was a ""big mouth and a fool"". ""It has exposed beyond doubt both his crass naivety and the cynical deceit of the EU masters he cravenly obeys,"" said an editorial in the paperBut what are the facts in the case? Speaking at a press conference in County Kerry on 18 July, Leo Varadkar said a no-deal Brexit would see Britain leave the Single European Sky programme, which co-ordinates flights in Europe.""If they want their planes to fly over our sky, they would need to take that into account,"" he said.Tomorrow's front page: The Irish PM was branded ""mad"" last night for threatening to block British planes flying over his country. https://t.co/r3aFRhfiM2 pic.twitter.com/DQ6LJqbl5GEnd of Twitter post  by @TheSun""The situation at the moment is that the UK is part of the Single European Sky and if they leave the EU they are not.""And that does mean if there was a no-deal hard Brexit next March, the planes would not fly and Britain would be an island in many ways - and that is something they need to think about.""Leo Varadkar was wrong to suggest British aircraft would be barred from Irish airspace in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to Downing Street.So-called ""overflight rights"" are guaranteed by international treaties rather than EU membership, said a Number 10 spokeswoman. The spokeswoman said the UK was confident of reaching a deal that included ""aviation access"".""It's wrong to claim that Ireland could simply stop the UK from flying over its land as a result of Brexit.""The reason we say that is because overflight rights are not guaranteed by the EU, rather by multilateral treaty which both ourselves and Ireland have signed up to.""The international treaty referred to by the UK government is the Chicago Convention which 52 states signed on 7 December 1944.It effectively guarantees the right of civil aviation to fly over the air space of signatory states without permission, but not necessarily to land. As Mr Varadkar talks about ""planes flying over our sky"", he is probably wrong on that point - and the UK government correct.However, the real issue would be planes landing and taking off at EU airports if the UK leaves European Single Sky and the European Aviation Safety Agency with no deal to replace their regulations.Mr Varadkar was speaking in terms of a ""no-deal Brexit"", while the UK government was responding in terms of reaching a deal. His ""planes would not fly"" remark could in theory become a reality if there was no deal, the need for which is tacitly implied in the UK statement. The Sun certainly took Mr Varadkar's comments as a threat, as did some unionist politicians in Northern Ireland. ""Given that the Irish State is dependent on the RAF for its air defence in the event of a terrorist attack it is obviously exceedingly unwise for  Varadkar to pompously and arrogantly suggest that Dublin could deny civilian aircraft from the UK access to Irish airspace,"" said Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister. DUP MLA Christopher Stalford countered that the Republic of Ireland gets its gas supply through the UK.Where the Republic of Ireland gets its gas from. Remember this the next time Leo decides to threaten the UK over airspace. pic.twitter.com/DR08JCtViNEnd of Twitter post  by @CStalfordMLA""Remember this the next time Leo decides to threaten the UK over airspace,"" he tweeted.In fact, the Republic of Ireland is on course to get the majority of its gas from Irish sources within the next few years.However Mr Varadkar was defended on social media by the Irish government's spokesperson on the EU""To be fair he merely reiterated a factual statement that Philip Hammond also made earlier this year,"" said Senator Neale Richmond. Eamonn Brennan, chief executive of the Irish Aviation Authority said as early as February 2017: ""Air connectivity all over the world is based on Air Service Agreements and once the UK leaves the EU a new Air Service Agreement will have to be put in place between the EU27 and the UK.Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair, has repeatedly warned that the UK is running out of time to agree a new open skies agreement with the EU, saying there is a ""real prospect"" that there will be no flights between the UK and Europe for a period beyond March 2019.In July 2017, the head of the Aerospace body ADS said that the UK must remain an EU member during a post-Brexit transition period.Aviation expert Paul Everitt said the UK would struggle to sign the necessary agreements with global safety regulators before then, risking disruption to air travel.""If we don't have a transition arrangement and if we aren't a member of the EU as part of that transitional arrangement, then we have chaos because we don't have a system to ensure that our products are safe and secure to fly and a regime that is acknowledged around the world,"" he said.Aviation consultant John Strickland said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the current aviation traffic rights framework would no longer apply.""Theoretically, at midnight on that day planes would be grounded,"" he said.But he questioned the likelihood of that happening. ""Even if technically a deal comes to an end it wouldn't be logical that you would just accept that that commercial airline traffic stops just to make a political point because you would be starving the economy,"" he added.""Whether you are on the UK side, or the Irish side, or the remain side, or the leave side… I don't see anybody that wins from the suspension of air services."""
2018-07-27,FOI failings,https://web.archive.org//web/20180728050524/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44864770,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMajor government departments are continuing to demonstrate persistent delays and unhelpfulness in their responses to information requests, according to research conducted by the BBC. Last June we reported on how the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Cabinet Office were frequently criticised by the Information Commissioner for their inadequate handling of FOI applications. Our analysis of decisions issued since then by the commissioner shows that the poor performance of these three departments has continued.The Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is being criticised by openness campaigners for not taking stronger action over the repeated failings. The Home Office has a particularly extreme record and has been rebuked by the Information Commissioner's Office in several dozen cases over the past 12 months.The ICO describes delays faced by requesters to the Home Office in various cases as ""unacceptable"", ""extremely lengthy"", ""particularly severe"" and ""inexplicable and unjustifiable"".In some instances the Home Office took several months to reach a decision and reply. In numerous other cases it failed to respond at all. The commissioner also reprimanded the Home Office over responses which were ""unhelpful"", showed ""poor handling"", ""did not provide any explanation"" or which contained a ""lack of detail"", ""no reasoning"", an ""extremely disappointing rationale"", or information which was ""not accurate"".Numerous ICO decision notices contain statements along the lines that the commissioner has made a record of the problem and that ""this issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases suggest that this is necessary"" or ""this may form evidence in future enforcement action against the HO should evidence from other cases suggest that there are systemic issues within the HO that are causing delays"".Since this is often repeated in the ICO decisions, it is not clear what further evidence of ""systemic issues"" ought to be required. The Ministry of Justice has also been frequently rebuked by the Commissioner for its failures to comply with the FOI law. The ICO criticises the ministry over delays which were ""very considerable"", ""far in excess of the requirement"", ""extremely lengthy"" and ""grossly excessive and entirely unacceptable"".As with the Home Office, there are numerous cases where the Ministry of Justice failed to send any response before the ICO's formal decision was issued. Similarly, many decision notices repeat the familiar statement that the failing has been noted and the issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases indicate there are systemic issues A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""We received nearly 5,000 FOI requests last year, one of the highest figures across Whitehall. We surpassed the ICO's high target for response times last year and have improved even further since - responding to 93% of requests on time in the latest figures.""The Cabinet Office also comes in for continuing criticism over its poor record on FOI.  This includes delays which were ""clearly against the spirit and intention of FOIA"", ""excessive"" and ""unacceptable"".It is also reprimanded for ""poorly conceived submissions"", lack of ""meaningful detail"", being ""illogical"", ""erroneous"", ""unsustainable"", providing ""generic"" arguments, handling which ""clearly fell short"", and having ""wrongly interpreted"" correspondence from a requester.This is despite the fact that the Cabinet Office is responsible for government FOI policy and should therefore set an example to other public authorities.Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information said that Elizabeth Denham should take stronger action: ""Departments have discovered that they can repeatedly ignore the regulator - and nothing happens. The solution is in the commissioner's hands. She should promptly serve chronic offenders with enforcement notices and threaten court action if they fail to comply.""She should also report the problem to Parliament and encourage a select committee to ask ministers in front of the TV cameras why they are treating the public's right to know with contempt.""An ICO spokesperson said: ""The ICO can take monitoring action if a public authority's performance needs to improve. Whether or not disclosure applies to a request is not always straightforward. That is why we work with departments to improve processes so decisions on what information can be released under FOI can be made more effectively and efficiently.""Requests to these departments which have been badly affected by delays include some submitted by myself and by BBC colleagues. The government departments involved have been approached for comment.Research by Patrick Cowling"

The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade.UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States.Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world.But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops.  The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019.To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. European Council President Donald Tusk has said he believes Brexit can be halted - but there is some debate about whether the Article 50 process, the two-year legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, is reversible. (You can read a full BBC Reality Check on the debate here.) If the UK did leave and wanted to immediately rejoin, it would need all the other EU member states to agree.A less formal version of staying in the EU would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue.The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - including Justine Greening.With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.Please upgrade your browser"
2018-07-27,Maastricht battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20180728050524/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44924844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNewly released files show how, behind the scenes, John Major decided how to overcome Conservative MPs who voted against the Maastricht treaty in July 1993.Summertime, Conservative civil war over Europe, and Rees-Mogg challenging the prime minister's European plans - but this wasn't Theresa May and Jacob Rees-Mogg but her predecessor, John Major, and his father, William, Lord Rees-Mogg. And the battle was not over Brexit but the Maastricht treaty. This was the agreement that turned the European Community into the European Union (EU) and laid the foundations for the European single currency, the euro.John Major had hailed the treaty, agreed in December 1991 by the then 12 member states, as a good deal for Britain. He praised the opportunities he believed a single market in goods and services, and the free movement of labour, offered. And he believed that a concession, allowing the UK to decide whether, not when, to join a single European currency, was key.Eurosceptic MPs said the treaty would give the EU greater powers at the expense of Westminster. They saw it as a step down the road to a centralised federal EU. And they were implacably opposed the UK joining a single European currency.In the Lords, the former Conservative Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher said that the treaty would ""diminish democracy and increase bureaucracy"".Lord Rees-Mogg went to court to stop the Maastricht treaty from becoming UK law - but judges supported the government's position, on all the issues. ""The outcome was even better than our lawyers had expected,"" Sir Roderic Lyne wrote on a note. He pointed out that Douglas Hurd, then Foreign Secretary, was ""exercising restraint"" in public as he did not want to ""provoke the Rees-Mogg brigade"" into ""further Quixotic action"".John Major enjoyed the moment. ""Good,"" he wrote on the document, ""a full gloat is merited.""Getting the treaty through the Commons took a year. Those who opposed it, from the Labour as well as Conservative benches, were vocal and well organised. But by July 1993 the end of the process was in sight.""It was the toughest time I spent in Downing Street,"" says Sir Roderic, who was John Major's private secretary at the time. ""I remember it as a nightmare.""John Major's strategy as the final vote loomed was a risky one. He would, if needed, call for a motion of confidence. If he had lost, the government would have fallen. It was, in effect, the ""nuclear option"" - either back me or face a general election.On 22 July 1993, after a series of close votes, the government lost the main motion. The ratification of the Maastricht treaty had been blocked.Then, in a moment of the highest political drama, John Major stood up at the dispatch box and announced there would be a vote of confidence in the government the following day, which would also act as a vote to write the treaty into UK law.Seeing all the papers reminds Sir Roderic of how much complex information the prime minister had to digest. ""John Major has an incredibly quick brain"" he says. ""He has a mind like a high-speed computer.""He recalls how on 21 July John Major had been depressed, knowing he had lost the first vote. He tried to work on a speech for the next day but lacked energy and went to bed. ""Everyone expected disaster,"" Sir Roderic says. Yet when he returned to Number 10 first thing next morning, the prime minister was ""perky"".""He had the glint of battle in his eye.""John Major had worked out his plan to call for confidence motion and had held three cabinet meetings to get his ministers to agree.His approach worked - opponents in his own party wouldn't vote against the government in a confidence vote. ""He basically lined the rebels up against a wall and aimed machine guns at them,"" as Sir Roderic puts it.The vote was won, by 339 to 299. John Major and his staff celebrated in his parliamentary office with champagne and congratulations arrived from European politicians. Albert Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, was friendly with Mr Major and sent a message saying: ""Well done.""Now keep your head down and drive on."" Sir Roderic Lyne is reluctant to draw too many parallels between then and now. ""Theresa May is unbelievably resilient I think,"" he says. ""Her problem is far worse than Major. He was attacked by 25 MPs. She's under fire from both right and left. And while for us, the real pressure came in the last stages, she's had it for two years."""
2018-07-27,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180728050524/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-27,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180728050524/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

Constitution Minister Chloe Smith said intimidation was putting ""talented people"" off standing for election. She added that the measures being consulted on would ""protect voters, candidates and campaigners so they can make their choice at the ballot box or stand for public service without fear of being victims of misinformation or abuse"".The length of the ban on convicted abusers standing for or holding public office would be a part of the consultation, a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said. A joint analysis of tweets in the run-up to the election in 2017, by the University of Sheffield and BuzzFeed News. found that male Conservative candidates received the highest percentage of abuse on Twitter. Amnesty International had carried out a separate analysis of the accounts of 177 female MPs in the six months leading up to the election and found that Labour's Diane Abbott received almost half (45.1%) of all abusive tweets that were sent to female MPs.By BBC political correspondent Alex ForsythIn reality this may not prevent swathes of people from standing for office who otherwise would have. There are existing rules which stop those convicted of crimes carrying a certain sentence from standing as an MP or local councillor.In addition, the vetting processes of political parties should - in theory at least - stop unsuitable candidates from being selected. But there has been pressure for ministers to do something to tackle online trolls who target people in public office.  After last year's general Election, several MPs reported some of the worst abuse and harassment that they'd experienced. There was even a debate in Parliament during which men and women from all political parties recounted their experience of sexist and racist comments, graphic language and even death threats. No doubt the government is keen to be seen to be taking this seriously. Currently, to stand in a general election, you must be at least 18 years old and either a British citizen, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland or an eligible Commonwealth citizen.

Mr Cummings was asked and officially summoned to take part in the inquiry - to respond to allegations made against the Vote Leave campaign - but he refused. Mr Cummings called the report ""fake news"".The report said people were increasingly finding out about what is happening in the country, local communities and the world through social media - rather than through traditional forms of communication such as television, print media or the radio.People were also less likely to question information shared on social media because most trust their friends and family.The MPs said this is where malicious actors come in to try to influence the billions of people who use social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.Fake news can come in a wide spectrum of forms, from satire and parody to fabricated images or propaganda, the report said.The report made a series of recommendations.It said:Mr Collins said: ""Data crimes are real crimes, with real victims. This is a watershed moment in terms of people realising they themselves are the product, not just the user of a free service.""Their rights over their data must be protected.""A spokeswoman said: ""The government takes disinformation very seriously, as with all types of online manipulation and internet harms.""That is why we have said we will come forward with new online safety laws to make sure the UK is the safest place to be online.""We note the committee's report and will consider its final recommendations"" The government is expected to publish a white paper later this year on proposals to reform laws to make the internet and social media safer.The committee's final report is expected before the end of the year."

The BBC understands that Mr Kurz has indicated he supports the idea of EU leaders holding formal Brexit talks at a summit in Salzburg in September.Mrs May hailed the strength of the UK's relationship with Austria, adding: ""We are delivering on a vote of the British people, they chose to leave the EU and we will deliver that."" Later, Mrs May pitched her idea for a post-Brexit free trade area to her Czech counterpart Andrej Babis.A Downing Street spokesman said: ""She highlighted that a UK-EU free trade area would maintain frictionless trade that would enable businesses across Europe to maintain their vital integrated supply chains.""They agreed it was important to find a solution and that negotiations should continue at pace.""Both the EU and UK say a deal can be done by October - five months before the UK is due to leave the European Union - but have also said preparations are being made in case negotiations end in no deal.Mr Barnier has already rejected a key element of her proposal for post-Brexit trade with the EU.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has accused the EU of pushing the UK towards a ""no deal"" scenario because they ""keep saying no to everything"".Mr Fox, who is on a trade mission to San Francisco, told Business Insider the UK should leave without a deal if talks break down, rather than requesting an extension of the Article 50 process to continue negotiations, as some have suggested.""To attempt to extend our membership even longer, many voters would regard as a complete betrayal by the political class, and I think they would be right,"" he added.Mrs May's trip to Austria is one of several being made to Europe by British government ministers over the summer to promote her plan, detailed in the Brexit White Paper, to European leaders.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met his German counterpart in Berlin on Monday and the UK chancellor, home secretary, business secretary and the minister for the Cabinet Office are also meeting counterparts across Europe over the summer.Following talks in Austria, Mrs May will head to Italy with her husband, Philip, for a week before returning to the UK to work. She is also due to attend a World War One memorial event marking the centenary of the battle of Amiens, which began on 8 August 1918, before heading off for two weeks' holiday in Switzerland.Analysis by BBC Diplomatic Correspondent James RobbinsSalzburg in high summer is packed with tourists and music lovers enjoying the annual festival.Theresa May went to the opera on Friday night, but only after her talks with Mr Kurz and Mr Babis.The prime minister is hoping to persuade them to urge others in the EU27 to relax their common position - particularly by accepting her proposals for continuing free movement of products after Brexit.But there's no sign either Austria or the Czech Republic is willing to budge. Eurosceptic feeling may be strong among their populations, but neither leader is contemplating following Britain out of the Union.  Instead, both governments believe Mrs May is still cherry-picking and that Britain must blink first to avoid what they call a catastrophic crash-out they are convinced would hurt the UK far more than the EU.Mozart's The Magic Flute, in the city of his birth, should have been something of a relief for Mrs May.The UK's Brexit White Paper, drawn up after agreement with the cabinet at Chequers, proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but Mrs May says it will end free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations.It would involve the UK collecting some EU tariffs - in a bid to ensure frictionless trade in goods and to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland - under its proposed Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-foods. The plan sparked two UK cabinet resignations - former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.

Labour activists in the south London constituency are angry about Ms Hoey's support for Brexit in an area that voted strongly for Remain and for voting with the government earlier this month on an amendment to the Trade Bill, a key piece of Brexit legislation. The no-confidence motion, which received unanimous backing at a party meeting on Thursday, says defeat in that Commons vote could have toppled the government and led to a general election that Labour was ""widely expected to win"".The motion also accuses Ms Hoey of ""reneging"" on Labour's manifesto pledge to oppose Theresa May's approach to Brexit and of ""colluding"" with then UKIP leader Nigel Farage during the EU referendum campaign.  It also attacks her backing of causes ""not compatible with Labour core beliefs"" such as fox hunting, ""elitist grammar schools"", and her chairmanship of the Countryside Alliance.The MP, who is currently in Zimbabwe as an election observer, has represented Vauxhall since 1989.She defended herself in a letter to local party members ahead of Thursday's vote.""The idea there would have been a general election if Labour MPs had supported the amendment is not true,"" she said.The amendment, tabled by pro-EU Tory backbenchers, ""was a backhand way of staying in the customs union,"" she argued, and ""this was not the position in the Labour manifesto on which I was re-elected"".In a statement to the Guardian, Ms Hoey said the result of the no-confidence vote was ""not a surprise"".""My local party activists are solid EU Remainers,"" she told the newspaper. ""I will always put my country before my party and helping my constituents is a priority. ""After 29 years as an MP I am quite relaxed about the vote and it won't influence in any way how I vote in future.""Earlier this week, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said he was seeking to persuade Ms Hoey and three other Labour rebels to stop ""propping up"" the government in key Brexit votes."

2018-07-28,Targeted pro-Brexit Facebook ads revealed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180729055849/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44966969,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe official Vote Leave campaign spent more than £2.7m on targeting ads at specific groups of people on Facebook - helping it to win the 2016 EU referendum.The US social media giant has now released these ads to a committee of MPs investigating fake news - meaning everyone, not just those they were originally aimed at, can now see them.The ads, created by Canadian company Aggregate AIQ, often focused on specific issues - such as immigration or animal rights - thought likely to push the buttons of certain groups of people, based on their age, where they lived and other personal data taken from social media and other sources.The 120 pages of documents appear to back up the findings of the Electoral Commission, which ruled last week that Vote Leave broke electoral law by working jointly with another campaign, BeLeave - something denied by both groups.A number of BeLeave ads were sent from the Vote Leave Facebook account, including this one:There are 1,433 different messages in the data set released by Facebook, all with one common theme - although it is not always clear that they have come from a pro-Brexit campaign.Here is one that was targeted at animal lovers:This one, targeted at tea-lovers, is more obviously pro-Brexit:Polar bears were also recruited to the cause:The adverts contained in the Facebook data set were seen more than 169 million times in total. The BeLeave messages were more closely directed at younger voters, promising a ""brighter future"" if the UK could stop ""EU regulators keeping us in the past"" and accusing Brussels of regulating ride-sharing apps such as Uber and enforcing quotas on data streaming.Data provided by Facebook suggests some of the most seen images were produced by BeLeave. This image was displayed on the screens of target audience members more than five million times: Older voters tended to be treated to claims about how much money the UK was sending to the EU. More than 140 ads made reference to the controversial claim that £350m a week sent to the EU could be spent on the NHS instead:Alternative uses for the £350m included schools and flood defences: Vote Leave made the most of then US President Barack Obama's intervention in the referendum campaign, when he said the UK would be at the ""back of the queue"" for trade deals.This ad was heavily targeted at older voters, with a reach of up to 25% among woman aged over 65 and 23% of men in that age group targeted by one version of it (as with many of the ads, the accompanying text was tweaked and refined from a basic ""parent"" ad):Immigration was another common theme, with one ad appearing to suggest the entire Turkish population was headed for the UK: Boris Johnson was the only politician to be pictured in the ads:Apart from one featuring Jeremy Corbyn, which was targeted at younger voters and accompanied by an old quote from the Labour leader: ""The EU takes away from national parliaments the power to set economic policy and hands it over to an unelected set of bankers.""Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party spent £32,750.73 with AIQ on pro-Brexit Facebook ads. Only 16 of the ads were delivered to users in Northern Ireland, according to the Facebook data. The remaining 24 were primarily seen by people in England.The 24 adverts, seen at least 1.96 million times - and potentially as many as 4.2 million times - were all posted in the final three days of the EU referendum campaign.Early on in the campaign, Vote Leave launched a giant data harvesting exercise through a competition to win £50m if you could correctly guess the result of all 51 games in the 2016 European football championship.The odds of winning the contest - which Vote Leave funded through an insurance policy - were calculated at one in 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. It was described by one Vote Leave insider at the time as a potential ""game changer"" because it would allow it to gather the contact details of thousands of potential voters, many of whom would not normally be interested in the referendum.The campaign recruited former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham to promote the contest:A separate group called Veterans for Britain had refused permission for its ads to be passed on, said Facebook.The Culture Media and Sport Committee is expected shortly to publish interim findings from its inquiry into fake news, which has taken evidence from whistleblower Christopher Wylie and technology company bosses as well as representatives of the separate Leave.EU campaign.Correction 27 July 2018: An earlier version of this story said some ads were seen by fewer than 1,000 people, according to the Facebook data, and this was an example of ""micro-targeting"". But former Vote Leave chief, Matthew Elliott, said the ads never ran, so we removed that reference."
2018-07-28,What now for the government?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180729055849/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44954369,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWestminster made it to the summer, just. It was messy, sweaty, with an almost daily roll call of nightmares for the government. Senior MPs say privately there were genuine moments, even last week, when various colleagues - not the usual suspects - were agitating to try to remove the prime minister. The government lost an important vote, but scraped through a vital one. The chief whip got caught out with some epic skulduggery. Big cabinet bruisers walked out, trashing the main government policy as they did.As the temperature rose, so did tempers. One senior MP told me that some significant Conservative backers were discussing withholding their next donations to the party because they were so unhappy at how Number 10 has been handling things. There have been plenty of moments of ""it can't go on like this"". But, ""it"" can, and it normally does.After the summer break then, when the prime minister will hope everyone in her party has calmed down, rather than plotted on WhatsApp from their sun loungers, how does the government ""go on like this""? What are the ways through? The first thing to say is that no country has left the European Union before like this. So there is no precedent. There is no map. Whether you find it deeply thrilling, or deeply alarming, ask even those who have held some of the highest offices in the land what happens if it all goes wrong and they don't know. There are, though, scenarios that can be sketched out.This might be fantasy but it's not impossible. Say Theresa May manages to get the EU to broker something on the basis of her latest plan and comes back with what one of her longstanding allies describes as ""Chequers minus minus"". There will likely have to be concessions on giving the EU more cash and more concessions on immigration, but it is a just about swallowable deal. It won't have escaped your notice by now that warnings about ""no deal"" are coming thick and fast, and ever more scarily, from ministers' mouths. This is no coincidence. It is not beyond the wit of man to see that stoking concern about ""no deal"" could, conveniently, encourage MPs to feel they have little choice but to vote for it. However, it is abundantly clear that there is a solid core of Brexiteer Tories who simply would not vote for it. And you can near as dammit be sure that Labour's official position won't be to back the government. One of the Labour leadership team told me: ""We will push her to the brink."" Don't underestimate either the concern that could spread far and wide about whether a deal like that would really be what people had voted for. So far, Number 10's analysis that the majority of people just want the prime minister to get on with Brexit and are not paying huge attention has been shown to be more or less right (not withstanding very vocal groups on either side of the debate). The dynamics of the actual deal might well change that.  But in Parliament, senior backers of Mrs May know that to get the vote through they'd have to rely on many Labour MPs either abstaining or voting with the government. If rejecting the deal feels like opening Pandora's box versus supporting a fudgey compromise, there could well be enough of them to allow Mrs May to squeak through. Maybe. And then, maybe, Europe will go back to being just another issue, albeit an important one.We will be in the EU departure lounge for a couple of years. Trade talks will be tricky, there will be plenty to sort out - but a deal will have been done and the government can, in theory, tell the public we are out, and life can get back to something approaching normal. Hmmm.It's also possible to see how the government does not even get that far. Right now, it seems the prime minister is absolutely intent on getting a deal. Those who know her well (it's not a long list!) say that is what is driving her above all else - getting something done. The mantra ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" has not aged well.But if the further concessions that the rest of the EU demands, for demand they will, are just too intense, requiring too much on immigration, or extra payments, forcing the prime minister not just to pinken her red lines but to scrub them out altogether, then maybe that could change and she could walk away. Right now it seems unlikely, but the chances of no deal have been rising. One diplomat, in sorrow more than anger, last week said to me he simply couldn't see how the EU would be able to offer anything that the prime minister could get through Parliament. Yes, anything that is viable at all.But if there is ""no deal"", and the government actually puts that on the table, it is hard to see Parliament backing that either. Many Tories, including many in government, are talking about when, not if, they make it plain that they would never support leaving without concluding an agreement. Those discussions are taking place, including among some serving ministers. What some Brexiteers have always wanted - a simple free trade deal - does find supporters around the EU. Indeed, one well-placed official suggested to me that if the White Paper wasn't coherent or workable, and the jury is very much out on that, then the EU could simply say in October, it's a basic deal on trade or nothing. Some Brexiteers would rejoice. But that would also have to come with the backstop to prevent a hard border in Ireland, which right now, despite all sorts of ideas being floated, is still a huge obstacle to getting a deal done. The prime minister says she simply couldn't sign up to it. And until there is a shift - or a magical solution - that way through the quagmire is out of reach. And indeed, if it becomes obvious in the autumn that the prime minister wants to sign something that is even more of a compromise than Chequers, then her nemesis, the Eurosceptics, might try to oust her well before she gets to bring the deal to Parliament. Then we are properly in a land where anything is possible. The Article 50 process is a legal mechanism, with a fixed deadline. But if the ruling party crashed into a leadership contest? If there was no one to negotiate with? Who knows? Could that mean a general election? Perhaps, a second referendum? Not out of the question. The People's Vote campaign pushing for this are stepping up their activities - not just in Westminster but around the country. By the time we sign off next summer, the government could have just navigated its way through the most complicated and troublesome political waters in decades. Or there could be a new prime minister, and the Conservative Party might have actually succeeded in smashing itself to bits. It will be 13 years then since David Cameron vowed the Tories would ""stop banging on about Europe"". It seems deeply optimistic to imagine that by then, they will have been able to move on. I, however, for the next few weeks won't be banging on about anything. It's the political holidays. Thank you for reading this page through another epic political year, and I'll see you on the other side when, the only thing I am really sure of, there will be plenty more to discuss. "
2018-07-28,Private probation contracts to end early,https://web.archive.org//web/20180729055849/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44973258,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPrivate companies that run probation services are to have their government contracts ended early - after MPs said the system for supervising criminals was in a ""mess"".The contracts began in 2015 to manage low-risk offenders in England and Wales, under a partial privatisation by then-Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.Ministers are proposing further changes and private firms will remain involved.But Labour said the costly contracts had created an  ""unprecedented crisis"".It comes after the Commons justice committee said in July that changes to probation had failed, and it was unconvinced private sector firms could ever deliver an effective service.BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the government had hoped that shaking up probation would result in less reoffending. The number of people reoffending has reduced slightly, but those that do are committing crimes more frequently.  The arrangements for managing offenders were overhauled in 2014, with the probation service split in two. A new state body, the National Probation Service (NPS), was set up to supervise high-risk offenders, with 21 privately run Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) supervising low and medium-risk offenders.But David Gauke, who became justice secretary in January, said that while the £3.7bn Transforming Rehabilitation (TR) programme had been ambitious and innovative, several CRCs had made ""very substantial losses"".Mr Gauke said the amount of work available for the CRCs had been ""lower than anticipated and that has had an impact in terms of their income and the services they are able to provide"".He also said he was determined to have a service that reduced reoffending, and could oversee ""tough"" community sentences with less reliance on ""ineffective"" short prison terms.Existing contracts will now end two years early, in 2020 - and will be replaced with 10 new ones under changes that will cost the government £170m. This includes £110m that the CRCs owe the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) in fines for failing to meet performance targets - but which they will be allowed to reinvest in services to keep them going for the last two years of their agreements.The MoJ will also pay £46m over the next two years for services that help offenders immediately after they are released from prison.The MoJ said it had budgeted to pay firms £2.5bn by 2020 but had only paid out £2.2bn - a saving of £300m - because less work than anticipated was allocated to the CRCs.This was because there was an increase in the proportion of serious offences which they were ineligible to work on.Mr Gauke said new contracts would make better use of offending data and would move towards ""payment for services delivered"", but he ruled out allowing CRCs to take on high-risk cases.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said: ""This decision to throw more good money after bad and the government's re-commitment to a privately-run probation service shows that the Conservatives have run out of all ideas on how to fix their broken system."" And the GMB union said the probation officers it represented were overworked and demoralised. GMB national officer George Georgiou said: ""Fragmenting the service has moved us away from a coherent national workforce strategy for the entire probation service.""But the government's proposals were welcomed by the chief probation inspector, Dame Glenys Stacey.Dame Glenys, who was critical of probation services in her report in December, said: ""There is much to welcome in these proposals, and we are pleased to see that our inspection evidence and findings and our wider advice have had significant influence and impact."""
2018-07-28,UK halts co-operation with US over 'Beatles' duo,https://web.archive.org//web/20180729055849/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44973586,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK has suspended co-operation with the US over two Islamic State suspects.Ministers had said they would share intelligence with the US that could lead to the men's conviction, without opposing a death penalty sentence.However the mother of one of the men has now launched a legal challenge to prevent such information sharing.The Home Office has halted co-operation until a judge has had a chance to consider an application for judicial review.Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, both of whom have been stripped of British nationality, are wanted for being part of the IS kidnap gang behind hostage executions. They are accused of being the last two members of an IS group dubbed ""The Beatles"" because of their British accents. Lawyers for the mother of El Shafee Elsheikh have now prepared detailed grounds challenging Mr Javid's decision to share information with the US without a death penalty assurance - meaning a case could be before High Court judges in days. They said the home secretary's actions revealed ""a clear and dramatic departure from the UK's long standing international and domestic commitment to oppose the continuing exercise of the death penalty.""A Home Office spokesperson said the government had ""agreed to a short-term pause"" but was confident it had ""acted in full accordance of the law"".The two men are currently being held by Kurdish forces and the UK believes it cannot legally extradite them to face trial here.  This week it emerged that the US was preparing the ground to prosecute the men itself - and that it had asked the UK for information that would help convict them.  In a letter leaked to the Daily Telegraph, Home Secretary Sajid Javid wrote that the UK would not oppose the use of the death penalty if the two men were extradited to the US.In the past Britain has sought assurances from foreign governments that the death penalty would not be used in cases where the UK provided information or extradited suspects.Number 10 had said this was ""a long-standing position"" to oppose the death penalty but added that in this case it was ""a priority to make sure that these men face criminal prosecution"".Analysis by BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic CascianiThe home secretary's position boils down to a simple question: Would you run the risk of them going free? Given Elsheikh and Kotey are in the custody of Syrian Kurdish forces, that sounds unlikely. But British prosecutors can't bring the men for trial here because they're not being held by a recognised state with whom the UK has a legally recognised extradition agreement - it would amount to kidnap.The forces holding the men are, however, backed by the US - and American courts are less fussy about the legalities of how a suspect ends up in the dock. The US may need British information to make a prosecution stick - hence the co-operation. This challenge from Mr Elsheikh's mother isn't about that evidence - but whether the ministerial decision to share it demolishes the UK's internationally recognised opposition to capital punishment. In case after case down the years, the UK has refused to provide legal help that could lead to overseas executions.So this decision to help the Americans, made in the hope of landing a conviction of two of the most wanted men in the world, could turn into a major legal fight. Labour accused the UK of having ""unilaterally abandoned"" its opposition to the death penalty.The former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Lord Carlile said this constituted ""a unilateral change of policy without any consultation"".The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said a senior British government official told him that this case was not the first time that the UK had dropped its request for assurances that the death penalty would not be used.But our correspondent said if the pair were sent to the controversial US military prison Guantanamo Bay - where suspects have been detained without trial - the UK would withhold intelligence."

The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March next year.The People's Vote campaign is hoping to get enough MPs, including the Labour leadership, to back a referendum on the deal Theresa May strikes with Brussels, which is due to be put to a vote in Parliament in October.In a statement backing the People's Vote campaign, he said: ""I am not a politician but I know when something is going wrong and right now Brexit feels like it is going very wrong indeed.""He said politicians seemed ""unable to resolve the problem"" the EU referendum had given them.Lineker has been critical of Brexit on social media in recent times, attracting claims of bias from Brexit supporters.  Critics have also pointed to a Twitter message he sent a year ago, which said ""Can't find the bit in my tweet where I ask for another referendum. Leave won. Get over it.""Replying to those comments, Lineker tweeted he was ""happy to admit I've now changed my mind"", adding that he did not envisage ""at the time that we'd ever contemplate a 'no deal Brexit' and the ensuing carnage that would bring"".A spokesman for the BBC said: ""Gary is not involved in any news or political output for the BBC and as such any expression of his personal political views does not affect the BBC's impartiality.""Senior Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who campaigned for Brexit in the referendum, was asked about Lineker's comments on ITV's Good Morning Britain.He said: ""I hesitate to criticise any individual - they're entitled to their opinion - but he's only one individual and during the referendum there were lots of stars and people who came out and endorsed this or the other, but people made up their own minds.""On the idea of MPs deciding to call a fresh referendum, he said that although most MPs had been for Remain in the 2016 vote, ""they have to accept the result... this will be a crisis for our democracy if the British people are ignored""."

He told BBC Scotland: ""Now that we're going into restructuring, we'd like to have a board with more knowledge and understanding about the technology element of media rather than a public figurehead.""The digital entrepreneur began to push the board last October, but stopped when he found a ""poison pill"" defence against hostile takeovers - a clause in bond-funding that would hand the company to lenders if the board were to be ousted.The company publishes the 'i', The Scotsman, Scotland on Sunday, the Yorkshire Post and about 200 local titles.It faces the risk of default on £220m of bonds, due for repayment in less than a year. It has been trying for months to reach a deal with the bond-holders.Mr Ager-Hanssen's recent renewed interest in the company, as reported in the business press, was followed by a sudden spike in its share price on Thursday morning.From a low of 3p, which valued the whole company at less than £3m, it trebled in price during the day, before settling back to 6p - 72% above its opening price.Mr Ager-Hanssen told BBC Scotland that it was not his company, Custos Group, that was trading the shares.He has written to the board, saying he would like to open talks.He said: ""We don't have any dialogue, but my intention is to get that dialogue going and get some insight into that information about the company.""In response to the price increase, Johnston Press issued a statement to say it was aware of no reason why the surge had taken place. It added: ""The company continues to explore a number of strategic options for the restructuring or refinancing of its bonds and confirms that no agreement on these potential options has been reached.""The statement continued: ""The company received a letter from Custos Group on Friday 20 July, and notes the press commentary on this over recent days.""The company confirms that it is not in receipt of any plan or proposal from any party for a refinancing or restructuring of its debt. Further announcements will be made as appropriate.  ""As stated previously, any proposal that results from these discussions will remain subject to negotiation and consent of relevant stakeholders, and there can be no certainty that a formal proposal will be forthcoming.""Mr Salmond, who lost his Westminster seat in 2017's general election, said in November he would take on the role if plans led by Mr Ager-Hanssen were approved by shareholders, but added that he would not have editorial control.Mr Salmond said the papers would be ""a champion of the community of interests they represent"".Since losing his parliamentary seat, Mr Salmond has hosted a chat show at the Edinburgh Fringe and a weekly radio programme on LBC. In November, he started hosting a talk show on the Russian state-funded broadcaster RT.Responding to the latest development, Mr Salmond described the article as a ""silly season"" story.He said: ""Mr Ager-Hanssen, as major shareholder in Johnston Press, is now focused on restructuring the ailing group rather than changing the board. ""I wish him luck in what will be a very hard task."""
2018-07-28,Medical cannabis products to be legalised,https://web.archive.org//web/20180729055849/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44968386,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSpecialist doctors in the UK will be able to legally prescribe cannabis-derived medicinal products by autumn, the home secretary has announced.Those that meet safety and quality standards are to be made legal for patients with an ""exceptional clinical need"", Sajid Javid said.As it is a devolved matter, it will require legislative change before it is enforced in Northern Ireland.Legalisation follows high-profile cases involving severely epileptic children.Many had previously been denied access to cannabis oil.Others forms of cannabis will remain illegal.Mr Javid's decision was made after the chief medical officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies, and the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said patients with certain medical conditions should be given access to the treatments.Their advice was part of a review into medicinal cannabis launched by the home secretary following an outcry over Billy Caldwell and Alfie Dingley being denied access to cannabis oil.The parents of the boys, who have rare forms of epilepsy, say it controls their seizures. The Home Office recently granted them licences to access the treatments. Mr Javid said: ""Recent cases involving sick children made it clear to me that our position on cannabis-related medicinal products was not satisfactory.  ""That is why we launched a review and set up an expert panel to advise on licence applications in exceptional circumstances.""This will help patients with an exceptional clinical need but is in no way a first step to the legalisation of cannabis for recreational use.""Billy Caldwell's mother, Charlotte, said Mr Javid's announcement had been made on her son's 13th birthday.""For the first time in months I'm almost lost for words, other than 'thank you Sajid Javid',"" she said. ""Never has Billy received a better birthday present, and never from somebody so unexpected...""But, crucially, my little boy Billy can now live a normal life with his mummy because of the simple ability to now administer a couple of drops a day of a long-maligned but entirely effective natural medication.""A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""The rescheduling of cannabis-derived medicinal products is a devolved matter and requires legislative change.""The Department of Health notes the advice provided by experts during the two-part review commissioned by the Home Secretary.  ""Consideration will be given to rescheduling cannabis-derived medicinal products in Northern Ireland in line with the rest of the UK ""In the interim, clinicians may still apply to the Home Office Expert Panel should they wish to use a cannabis-based medicine in the treatment of a patient."" Cannabis is classed as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning it is judged to have no therapeutic value but can be used for the purposes of research with a Home Office licence.The decision by the Home Office will put certain cannabis-derived products into Schedule 2 - those that have a potential medical use - and will place them in the same category as cocaine and heroin, among other drugs. The Department for Health and Social Care and the Medicines and Health products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will now develop a clear definition of what constitutes a cannabis-derived medicinal product so they can be rescheduled and prescribed, the Home Office said. In the meantime, clinicians will still be able to apply to an independent expert panel on behalf of patients wishing to access these products. The home secretary said licence fees for applications made to the panel will be waived, and those already granted will not be charged.The home secretary's decision was welcomed by campaigners and health experts.Donna Kinnair, from the Royal College of Nursing, said the decision was ""very welcome"".Dr Tom Freeman, senior academic fellow at King's College London, said Mr Javid's decision would have a ""substantial impact on research by facilitating the development of safer and more effective medicines"".Former justice minister Sir Mike Penning, who was among those appealing for Alfie Dingley to be given a special licence for medicinal cannabis, welcomed the announcement but said there were still unanswered questions about which treatments would be rescheduled.""Any move to restrict medical cannabis in the UK to a very narrow range of derived products, each requiring full pharmaceutical trials, thereby blocking out the many products available overseas, will lead to great disappointment and be a missed opportunity.""

But many people do not fit neatly into either category, throwing up complex and unexpected dilemmas for both the Home Office and the individuals concerned.Some, such as Ursula Crosby, who contacted the BBC with her story, have been unable to get a clear answer about how to secure residency rights, and citizenship, when Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Ms Crosby retired to Portugal five years ago after 40 years of working as a physiotherapist in NHS hospitals, in London and Shrewsbury. She says she felt like spreading her wings and ""doing something a bit different"" while she could.She is a German citizen but under free movement rules she had the security of knowing she could return to the UK, where her daughter lives and where she still owns property, when she wanted to.Brexit has changed that. The UK has told EU citizens they will be able to apply for ""settled status"" if they have been living in the UK for five years or have been granted indefinite leave to remain. It is unclear how this will apply to Ms Crosby, who was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 1979. Indefinite leave to remain - despite the name - usually expires if you have left the country for two years or more, as is the case with Ms Crosby. She has received conflicting advice from UK officials about whether she would qualify for settled status and no-one has been able to tell her what will happen if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. For all the government's assurances about how easy it will be for EU citizens after Brexit, getting a straight answer on all but the most straightforward of cases is very difficult, if the experience of researching this article is anything to go by.At one point, Ms Crosby was referred to an independent immigration adviser, who told her she would be all right because Britain would probably stay in the European Economic Area after Brexit - which would be news to Prime Minister Theresa May, who has repeatedly ruled that out.She is now torn between selling up and moving back to the UK before Britain leaves the EU in March, or risking moving back at a later date, during the 21-month transition period that will follow Brexit, in the hope that she can still secure settled status.""I am sure I could live in Germany but I wouldn't really want to live in Germany,"" says the 68-year-old. ""I no longer have any connections there, as such. My parents are dead. I have a cousin in Germany. ""I could stay in Portugal but I am not sure I would want to. It was never my intention to and I still have property in England.""If I ask anybody who meets me, they all think I am British.""She first came to the UK in 1971, on a work permit, long before EU free movement rules came into force, and was married to a British man for many years.She now regrets not applying for British citizenship when she had the chance but, like many others, she did not think she needed to.""There are probably quite a lot of people in this situation,"" says immigration lawyer Colin Yeo, ""people that used to live in the UK, perhaps for a very long time, who were assuming they would be able to come back to the UK because it is a member of the EU.""They will probably be all right if they come back during the transition period.""But, he adds, many will feel ""they have got to come back now or they will lose the chance"". Ms Crosby says she can't understand why, as someone in receipt of a full UK state pension, as well as an NHS pension, she may have to wait five years after returning to the UK to qualify for British citizenship, the same as someone from an EU country who has never lived there.""I am an honest person, I have no convictions, I paid my taxes and if I go back I will be able to support myself. Am I doing any harm?"" she says.The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases, but a spokeswoman said: ""After we leave the EU, in March 2019, there will be an implementation period that ends on 31 December 2020, during which EU citizens and their family members will be free to live, work and study in the UK as they do now. ""EU citizens and their family members who become resident in the UK during the implementation period will be able to make an application to the EU Settlement Scheme and be eligible for temporary leave to remain and, after five years' lawful residence, settled status, under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement. ""The rights of those EU citizens arriving during the implementation period will be safeguarded on the same terms as has been agreed for those EU citizens resident in the UK before we leave the EU.""Ms Crosby remains unconvinced by the Home Office's reassurances - and she has written to the department to try to get some clear guidance on what she should do next.""I am not sure I can rely on the immigration system to relax their very inflexible rules,"" she says.""My worst fear is that I sell up here, move back to England and then find out that it would not have been necessary."""

What's happened in the opinion polls and what can they tell us about what could happen when Parliament returns in the autumn?Please enable Javascript to view our poll tracker.In the first six months of 2018 the Westminster voting intention opinion polls were rather dull. But since the cabinet awayday at Chequers on 6 July, and the publication of the government's Brexit white paper the following week, there has been a marked change.For months the polls only moved very gradually. Between January and the beginning of July support for Labour dipped a couple of percentage points whilst the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats went up by about one per cent each.That did mean the Tories were fairly reliably in the lead, but only narrowly. Then came Chequers - and the calm of the first half of the year came to an abrupt end.The Conservatives have seen their rating fall back. In a couple of polls they've been at 36%, their lowest level since last year's general election.As a result, Labour has moved ahead in a sequence of polls for the first time since February.The other beneficiaries of the Conservative drop are UKIP. Until Chequers they'd not topped 5% this year. They've been above that in each of the last five published polls.None of this should be exaggerated. The movements aren't massive. But after months where changes happened at a snail's pace, it's a striking development.It could yet turn out that this is just a blip. The absence of warring Conservative MPs from Westminster might see the public's view of the party improve. But if it is a blip, it's a pretty big one.And it potentially foreshadows further turbulence in the autumn when Theresa May and the EU hope to finalise a Brexit deal.To see how difficult the prime minister's task is on Brexit just look at polls about it.Voters remain pretty evenly split about whether it was a good decision.We've seen a continuation of the trend from 2017. Over time, the number of people who say that Brexit was the wrong decision has very gradually increased, but there's no sign of a consensus forming.Worse still for the prime minister, polls which seek to capture what people think should happen next suggest an even more divided public.An interesting poll by new polling firm Deltapoll asked precisely that question: According to this poll, there's no course of action which has the support of even a third of voters. That could cause problems for Theresa May. It's going to be very hard for her to please a majority of the public whatever she does."

The Sun said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was a ""big mouth and a fool"". ""It has exposed beyond doubt both his crass naivety and the cynical deceit of the EU masters he cravenly obeys,"" said an editorial in the paperBut what are the facts in the case? Speaking at a press conference in County Kerry on 18 July, Leo Varadkar said a no-deal Brexit would see Britain leave the Single European Sky programme, which co-ordinates flights in Europe.""If they want their planes to fly over our sky, they would need to take that into account,"" he said.Tomorrow's front page: The Irish PM was branded ""mad"" last night for threatening to block British planes flying over his country. https://t.co/r3aFRhfiM2 pic.twitter.com/DQ6LJqbl5GEnd of Twitter post  by @TheSun""The situation at the moment is that the UK is part of the Single European Sky and if they leave the EU they are not.""And that does mean if there was a no-deal hard Brexit next March, the planes would not fly and Britain would be an island in many ways - and that is something they need to think about.""Leo Varadkar was wrong to suggest British aircraft would be barred from Irish airspace in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to Downing Street.So-called ""overflight rights"" are guaranteed by international treaties rather than EU membership, said a Number 10 spokeswoman. The spokeswoman said the UK was confident of reaching a deal that included ""aviation access"".""It's wrong to claim that Ireland could simply stop the UK from flying over its land as a result of Brexit.""The reason we say that is because overflight rights are not guaranteed by the EU, rather by multilateral treaty which both ourselves and Ireland have signed up to.""The international treaty referred to by the UK government is the Chicago Convention which 52 states signed on 7 December 1944.It effectively guarantees the right of civil aviation to fly over the air space of signatory states without permission, but not necessarily to land. As Mr Varadkar talks about ""planes flying over our sky"", he is probably wrong on that point - and the UK government correct.However, the real issue would be planes landing and taking off at EU airports if the UK leaves European Single Sky and the European Aviation Safety Agency with no deal to replace their regulations.Mr Varadkar was speaking in terms of a ""no-deal Brexit"", while the UK government was responding in terms of reaching a deal. His ""planes would not fly"" remark could in theory become a reality if there was no deal, the need for which is tacitly implied in the UK statement. The Sun certainly took Mr Varadkar's comments as a threat, as did some unionist politicians in Northern Ireland. ""Given that the Irish State is dependent on the RAF for its air defence in the event of a terrorist attack it is obviously exceedingly unwise for  Varadkar to pompously and arrogantly suggest that Dublin could deny civilian aircraft from the UK access to Irish airspace,"" said Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister. DUP MLA Christopher Stalford countered that the Republic of Ireland gets its gas supply through the UK.Where the Republic of Ireland gets its gas from. Remember this the next time Leo decides to threaten the UK over airspace. pic.twitter.com/DR08JCtViNEnd of Twitter post  by @CStalfordMLA""Remember this the next time Leo decides to threaten the UK over airspace,"" he tweeted.In fact, the Republic of Ireland is on course to get the majority of its gas from Irish sources within the next few years.However Mr Varadkar was defended on social media by the Irish government's spokesperson on the EU""To be fair he merely reiterated a factual statement that Philip Hammond also made earlier this year,"" said Senator Neale Richmond. Eamonn Brennan, chief executive of the Irish Aviation Authority said as early as February 2017: ""Air connectivity all over the world is based on Air Service Agreements and once the UK leaves the EU a new Air Service Agreement will have to be put in place between the EU27 and the UK.Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair, has repeatedly warned that the UK is running out of time to agree a new open skies agreement with the EU, saying there is a ""real prospect"" that there will be no flights between the UK and Europe for a period beyond March 2019.In July 2017, the head of the Aerospace body ADS said that the UK must remain an EU member during a post-Brexit transition period.Aviation expert Paul Everitt said the UK would struggle to sign the necessary agreements with global safety regulators before then, risking disruption to air travel.""If we don't have a transition arrangement and if we aren't a member of the EU as part of that transitional arrangement, then we have chaos because we don't have a system to ensure that our products are safe and secure to fly and a regime that is acknowledged around the world,"" he said.Aviation consultant John Strickland said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the current aviation traffic rights framework would no longer apply.""Theoretically, at midnight on that day planes would be grounded,"" he said.But he questioned the likelihood of that happening. ""Even if technically a deal comes to an end it wouldn't be logical that you would just accept that that commercial airline traffic stops just to make a political point because you would be starving the economy,"" he added.""Whether you are on the UK side, or the Irish side, or the remain side, or the leave side… I don't see anybody that wins from the suspension of air services."""
2018-07-28,FOI failings,https://web.archive.org//web/20180729055849/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44864770,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMajor government departments are continuing to demonstrate persistent delays and unhelpfulness in their responses to information requests, according to research conducted by the BBC. Last June we reported on how the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Cabinet Office were frequently criticised by the Information Commissioner for their inadequate handling of FOI applications. Our analysis of decisions issued since then by the commissioner shows that the poor performance of these three departments has continued.The Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is being criticised by openness campaigners for not taking stronger action over the repeated failings. The Home Office has a particularly extreme record and has been rebuked by the Information Commissioner's Office in several dozen cases over the past 12 months.The ICO describes delays faced by requesters to the Home Office in various cases as ""unacceptable"", ""extremely lengthy"", ""particularly severe"" and ""inexplicable and unjustifiable"".In some instances the Home Office took several months to reach a decision and reply. In numerous other cases it failed to respond at all. The commissioner also reprimanded the Home Office over responses which were ""unhelpful"", showed ""poor handling"", ""did not provide any explanation"" or which contained a ""lack of detail"", ""no reasoning"", an ""extremely disappointing rationale"", or information which was ""not accurate"".Numerous ICO decision notices contain statements along the lines that the commissioner has made a record of the problem and that ""this issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases suggest that this is necessary"" or ""this may form evidence in future enforcement action against the HO should evidence from other cases suggest that there are systemic issues within the HO that are causing delays"".Since this is often repeated in the ICO decisions, it is not clear what further evidence of ""systemic issues"" ought to be required. The Ministry of Justice has also been frequently rebuked by the Commissioner for its failures to comply with the FOI law. The ICO criticises the ministry over delays which were ""very considerable"", ""far in excess of the requirement"", ""extremely lengthy"" and ""grossly excessive and entirely unacceptable"".As with the Home Office, there are numerous cases where the Ministry of Justice failed to send any response before the ICO's formal decision was issued. Similarly, many decision notices repeat the familiar statement that the failing has been noted and the issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases indicate there are systemic issues A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""We received nearly 5,000 FOI requests last year, one of the highest figures across Whitehall. We surpassed the ICO's high target for response times last year and have improved even further since - responding to 93% of requests on time in the latest figures.""The Cabinet Office also comes in for continuing criticism over its poor record on FOI.  This includes delays which were ""clearly against the spirit and intention of FOIA"", ""excessive"" and ""unacceptable"".It is also reprimanded for ""poorly conceived submissions"", lack of ""meaningful detail"", being ""illogical"", ""erroneous"", ""unsustainable"", providing ""generic"" arguments, handling which ""clearly fell short"", and having ""wrongly interpreted"" correspondence from a requester.This is despite the fact that the Cabinet Office is responsible for government FOI policy and should therefore set an example to other public authorities.Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information said that Elizabeth Denham should take stronger action: ""Departments have discovered that they can repeatedly ignore the regulator - and nothing happens. The solution is in the commissioner's hands. She should promptly serve chronic offenders with enforcement notices and threaten court action if they fail to comply.""She should also report the problem to Parliament and encourage a select committee to ask ministers in front of the TV cameras why they are treating the public's right to know with contempt.""An ICO spokesperson said: ""The ICO can take monitoring action if a public authority's performance needs to improve. Whether or not disclosure applies to a request is not always straightforward. That is why we work with departments to improve processes so decisions on what information can be released under FOI can be made more effectively and efficiently.""Requests to these departments which have been badly affected by delays include some submitted by myself and by BBC colleagues. The government departments involved have been approached for comment.Research by Patrick Cowling"

The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade.UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States.Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world.But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops.  The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019.To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. European Council President Donald Tusk has said he believes Brexit can be halted - but there is some debate about whether the Article 50 process, the two-year legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, is reversible. (You can read a full BBC Reality Check on the debate here.) If the UK did leave and wanted to immediately rejoin, it would need all the other EU member states to agree.A less formal version of staying in the EU would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue.The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - including Justine Greening.With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.Please upgrade your browser"
2018-07-28,Maastricht battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20180729055849/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44924844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNewly released files show how, behind the scenes, John Major decided how to overcome Conservative MPs who voted against the Maastricht treaty in July 1993.Summertime, Conservative civil war over Europe, and Rees-Mogg challenging the prime minister's European plans - but this wasn't Theresa May and Jacob Rees-Mogg but her predecessor, John Major, and his father, William, Lord Rees-Mogg. And the battle was not over Brexit but the Maastricht treaty. This was the agreement that turned the European Community into the European Union (EU) and laid the foundations for the European single currency, the euro.John Major had hailed the treaty, agreed in December 1991 by the then 12 member states, as a good deal for Britain. He praised the opportunities he believed a single market in goods and services, and the free movement of labour, offered. And he believed that a concession, allowing the UK to decide whether, not when, to join a single European currency, was key.Eurosceptic MPs said the treaty would give the EU greater powers at the expense of Westminster. They saw it as a step down the road to a centralised federal EU. And they were implacably opposed the UK joining a single European currency.In the Lords, the former Conservative Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher said that the treaty would ""diminish democracy and increase bureaucracy"".Lord Rees-Mogg went to court to stop the Maastricht treaty from becoming UK law - but judges supported the government's position, on all the issues. ""The outcome was even better than our lawyers had expected,"" Sir Roderic Lyne wrote on a note. He pointed out that Douglas Hurd, then Foreign Secretary, was ""exercising restraint"" in public as he did not want to ""provoke the Rees-Mogg brigade"" into ""further Quixotic action"".John Major enjoyed the moment. ""Good,"" he wrote on the document, ""a full gloat is merited.""Getting the treaty through the Commons took a year. Those who opposed it, from the Labour as well as Conservative benches, were vocal and well organised. But by July 1993 the end of the process was in sight.""It was the toughest time I spent in Downing Street,"" says Sir Roderic, who was John Major's private secretary at the time. ""I remember it as a nightmare.""John Major's strategy as the final vote loomed was a risky one. He would, if needed, call for a motion of confidence. If he had lost, the government would have fallen. It was, in effect, the ""nuclear option"" - either back me or face a general election.On 22 July 1993, after a series of close votes, the government lost the main motion. The ratification of the Maastricht treaty had been blocked.Then, in a moment of the highest political drama, John Major stood up at the dispatch box and announced there would be a vote of confidence in the government the following day, which would also act as a vote to write the treaty into UK law.Seeing all the papers reminds Sir Roderic of how much complex information the prime minister had to digest. ""John Major has an incredibly quick brain"" he says. ""He has a mind like a high-speed computer.""He recalls how on 21 July John Major had been depressed, knowing he had lost the first vote. He tried to work on a speech for the next day but lacked energy and went to bed. ""Everyone expected disaster,"" Sir Roderic says. Yet when he returned to Number 10 first thing next morning, the prime minister was ""perky"".""He had the glint of battle in his eye.""John Major had worked out his plan to call for confidence motion and had held three cabinet meetings to get his ministers to agree.His approach worked - opponents in his own party wouldn't vote against the government in a confidence vote. ""He basically lined the rebels up against a wall and aimed machine guns at them,"" as Sir Roderic puts it.The vote was won, by 339 to 299. John Major and his staff celebrated in his parliamentary office with champagne and congratulations arrived from European politicians. Albert Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, was friendly with Mr Major and sent a message saying: ""Well done.""Now keep your head down and drive on."" Sir Roderic Lyne is reluctant to draw too many parallels between then and now. ""Theresa May is unbelievably resilient I think,"" he says. ""Her problem is far worse than Major. He was attacked by 25 MPs. She's under fire from both right and left. And while for us, the real pressure came in the last stages, she's had it for two years."""
2018-07-28,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180729055849/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-28,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180729055849/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

No I didn't.""A Labour spokesperson, responding to the incident, said the party takes all complaints extremely seriously, adding: ""These are fully investigated in line with party rules and procedures"".Labour's code of conduct was drawn up earlier this month and followed allegations of anti-Semitism within party ranks.The code does reproduce the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and lists behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic. But Jewish leaders and some Labour MPs have been critical, pointing out the code does not include four working examples provided by the IHRA definition. They say the party should adopt these examples in complete form from the IHRA.Labour says its own wording ""expands on and contextualises"" the IHRA examples.The party has said that while the examples are not reproduced word for word, they are covered elsewhere in the new code and it has produced ""robust, legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases"".The IHRA examples of anti-Semitic behaviour include requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations and comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis.According to the Observer, Mr Austin received a letter warning him he could face disciplinary action following the incident. Speaking to the Radio 4 programme The World This Weekend, Mr Austin denied he was using the ongoing anti-Semitism debate as a way to attack Jeremy Corbyn.Mr Corbyn has repeatedly said anti-Semitism is wrong and it will not be tolerated in the party. Mr Austin said the Labour leader had always been on the ""extreme fringes"" of the party, ""supporting and defending all sorts of extremists and in some cases frankly, anti-Semites"".""That's why I think now that somebody with views and history like his isn't really suited to the leadership of a mainstream political party,"" he said.""Am I upset about anti-Semitism? Yes I am. And I'm upset as well about the leadership's failure, I think refusal really, to deal with this properly.""I grew up listening to my dad tell me how he'd escaped from the Holocaust and how his mum and sisters were murdered in Treblinka [a Nazi death camp] and that led to me joining Labour Party as a teenager determined to fight racism.""""I'm really shocked that a party that has got a proud tradition throughout its entire existence of fighting racism has ended up causing such huge offence and distress to the Jewish community in Britain.""Mr Austin said he was ""ashamed of the Labour Party"", adding: ""We are becoming a different political party. This could just never have happened in the past.""Mr Austin is the second Labour MP to face suspension, after the party launched a disciplinary inquiry into Labour veteran Margaret Hodge.She reportedly swore at Jeremy Corbyn and called him an anti-Semite.Labour's shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said he would not condemn Mr Austin as he ""didn't see what happened"", adding that he hoped the situation could be resolved ""amicably"".""What we need to ensure is that the people who disciplinary action is taken against are the small number in the party who have said or done anti-Semitic things, not those who have strong opinions about things we should all have strong opinions about.""Labour's National Executive Committee approved its new code following continuing criticism of its handling of anti-Jewish discrimination and attitudes within its ranks.After criticism of its code of conduct, the party said it would ""in recognition of the serious concerns expressed... reopen the development of the code"" in consultation with Jewish groups. The party's MPs will vote in September on whether to adopt the full IHRA wording after passing an emergency motion at a meeting on Monday night.Earlier this week, the UK's three main Jewish newspapers united to publish the same front page, warning that a Corbyn-led government would pose an ""existential threat to Jewish life"".Two senior members of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet have also suggested the controversial new code of conduct should be rewritten.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the party's ruling NEC to ""reconsider"" its decision and include the full definition.Barry Gardiner, shadow international trade secretary, said it ""would have been better"" to adopt the IHRA definition in full. Labour MPs Chuka Umunna, Liz Kendall and Anna Turley have also been critical.And five senior Scottish Labour politicians - MSPs Monica Lennon, Jackie Baillie, Anas Sarwar, Daniel Johnson and Colin Smyth - on Sunday said they want the wider party to adopt the wording in full.The Board of Deputies of British Jews said Labour has become a party that ""obstructs measures to counter hatred and punishes those who speak out against it"" and called on Mr Corbyn to lead it out of ""this deep abyss""."

Separate figures released in January showed that while the number of young people arrested fell 79% in the last 10 years, there has also been a rise in violent offences among people under the age of 18.The Early Intervention Youth Fund was originally announced in March by then Home Secretary Amber Rudd as part of the government's strategy to cut violent crime.The strategy highlighted the problem of gangs that recruit children as drug couriers and the online ""glamourisation"" of crime.Sports and mentoring schemes could benefit from the new fund.Mr Javid said: ""Intervening early in the lives of vulnerable young people can help focus their talents on positive activities and steer them away from the dangers of serious violence.""The fund will support groups at the heart of our communities who educate and interact with youths - and provide them with an alternative to crime.""The government had faced criticism that some of the rise in violent crime has been caused by a lack of youth services.In February, when London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced £45m would be spent on helping young people in London at risk of being caught up in crime in the next three years he said council youth services had been ""decimated"" by a fall in government funding."

""We know how important it is for customers, and since the mid-1990s companies have successfully managed to reduce leakage levels by a third.

Mr Cummings was asked and officially summoned to take part in the inquiry - to respond to allegations made against the Vote Leave campaign - but he refused. Mr Cummings called the report ""fake news"".The report said people were increasingly finding out about what is happening in the country, local communities and the world through social media - rather than through traditional forms of communication such as television, print media or the radio.People were also less likely to question information shared on social media because most trust their friends and family.The MPs said this is where malicious actors come in to try to influence the billions of people who use social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.Fake news can come in a wide spectrum of forms, from satire and parody to fabricated images or propaganda, the report said.The report made a series of recommendations.It said:Mr Collins said: ""Data crimes are real crimes, with real victims. This is a watershed moment in terms of people realising they themselves are the product, not just the user of a free service.""Their rights over their data must be protected.""Labour's shadow secretary for digital, culture, media and sport, Tom Watson, said Britain's electoral laws needed updating ""for the modern campaigning environment"".""Labour called for increased powers for the Electoral Commission during the passage of the Data Protection Bill on digital imprints, the disclosure of funding sources and settings for targeted adverts and increasing the commission's investigatory powers. ""These calls were rejected by the Conservatives,"" he said.Meanwhile, the Electoral Commission welcomed the committee's report and said it backs calls to modernise electoral law.A spokeswoman said: ""The government takes disinformation very seriously, as with all types of online manipulation and internet harms.""That is why we have said we will come forward with new online safety laws to make sure the UK is the safest place to be online.""We note the committee's report and will consider its final recommendations"" The government is expected to publish a white paper later this year on proposals to reform laws to make the internet and social media safer.The committee's final report is expected before the end of the year."

Constitution Minister Chloe Smith said intimidation was putting ""talented people"" off standing for election. She added that the measures being consulted on would ""protect voters, candidates and campaigners so they can make their choice at the ballot box or stand for public service without fear of being victims of misinformation or abuse"".The length of the ban on convicted abusers standing for or holding public office would be a part of the consultation, a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said. A joint analysis of tweets in the run-up to the election in 2017, by the University of Sheffield and BuzzFeed News. found that male Conservative candidates received the highest percentage of abuse on Twitter. Amnesty International had carried out a separate analysis of the accounts of 177 female MPs in the six months leading up to the election and found that Labour's Diane Abbott received almost half (45.1%) of all abusive tweets that were sent to female MPs.By BBC political correspondent Alex ForsythIn reality this may not prevent swathes of people from standing for office who otherwise would have. There are existing rules which stop those convicted of crimes carrying a certain sentence from standing as an MP or local councillor.In addition, the vetting processes of political parties should - in theory at least - stop unsuitable candidates from being selected. But there has been pressure for ministers to do something to tackle online trolls who target people in public office.  After last year's general Election, several MPs reported some of the worst abuse and harassment that they'd experienced. There was even a debate in Parliament during which men and women from all political parties recounted their experience of sexist and racist comments, graphic language and even death threats. No doubt the government is keen to be seen to be taking this seriously. Currently, to stand in a general election, you must be at least 18 years old and either a British citizen, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland or an eligible Commonwealth citizen.

The BBC understands that Mr Kurz has indicated he supports the idea of EU leaders holding formal Brexit talks at a summit in Salzburg in September.Mrs May hailed the strength of the UK's relationship with Austria, adding: ""We are delivering on a vote of the British people, they chose to leave the EU and we will deliver that."" Later, Mrs May pitched her idea for a post-Brexit free trade area to her Czech counterpart Andrej Babis.A Downing Street spokesman said: ""She highlighted that a UK-EU free trade area would maintain frictionless trade that would enable businesses across Europe to maintain their vital integrated supply chains.""They agreed it was important to find a solution and that negotiations should continue at pace.""Both the EU and UK say a deal can be done by October - five months before the UK is due to leave the European Union - but have also said preparations are being made in case negotiations end in no deal.Mr Barnier has already rejected a key element of her proposal for post-Brexit trade with the EU.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has accused the EU of pushing the UK towards a ""no deal"" scenario because they ""keep saying no to everything"".Mr Fox, who is on a trade mission to San Francisco, told Business Insider the UK should leave without a deal if talks break down, rather than requesting an extension of the Article 50 process to continue negotiations, as some have suggested.""To attempt to extend our membership even longer, many voters would regard as a complete betrayal by the political class, and I think they would be right,"" he added.Mrs May's trip to Austria is one of several being made to Europe by British government ministers over the summer to promote her plan, detailed in the Brexit White Paper, to European leaders.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met his German counterpart in Berlin on Monday and the UK chancellor, home secretary, business secretary and the minister for the Cabinet Office are also meeting counterparts across Europe over the summer.Following talks in Austria, Mrs May will head to Italy with her husband, Philip, for a week before returning to the UK to work. She is also due to attend a World War One memorial event marking the centenary of the battle of Amiens, which began on 8 August 1918, before heading off for two weeks' holiday in Switzerland.Analysis by BBC Diplomatic Correspondent James RobbinsSalzburg in high summer is packed with tourists and music lovers enjoying the annual festival.Theresa May went to the opera on Friday night, but only after her talks with Mr Kurz and Mr Babis.The prime minister is hoping to persuade them to urge others in the EU27 to relax their common position - particularly by accepting her proposals for continuing free movement of products after Brexit.But there's no sign either Austria or the Czech Republic is willing to budge. Eurosceptic feeling may be strong among their populations, but neither leader is contemplating following Britain out of the Union.  Instead, both governments believe Mrs May is still cherry-picking and that Britain must blink first to avoid what they call a catastrophic crash-out they are convinced would hurt the UK far more than the EU.Mozart's The Magic Flute, in the city of his birth, should have been something of a relief for Mrs May.The UK's Brexit White Paper, drawn up after agreement with the cabinet at Chequers, proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but Mrs May says it will end free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations.It would involve the UK collecting some EU tariffs - in a bid to ensure frictionless trade in goods and to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland - under its proposed Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-foods. The plan sparked two UK cabinet resignations - former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Mr Barnier said on Thursday that the EU ""will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules and VAT and excises duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU's governance structures"".Any customs arrangement or union ""must respect this principle"", he said.

Labour activists in the south London constituency are angry about Ms Hoey's support for Brexit in an area that voted strongly for Remain and for voting with the government earlier this month on an amendment to the Trade Bill, a key piece of Brexit legislation. The no-confidence motion, which received unanimous backing at a party meeting on Thursday, says defeat in that Commons vote could have toppled the government and led to a general election that Labour was ""widely expected to win"".The motion also accuses Ms Hoey of ""reneging"" on Labour's manifesto pledge to oppose Theresa May's approach to Brexit and of ""colluding"" with then UKIP leader Nigel Farage during the EU referendum campaign.  It also attacks her backing of causes ""not compatible with Labour core beliefs"" such as fox hunting, ""elitist grammar schools"", and her chairmanship of the Countryside Alliance.The MP, who is currently in Zimbabwe as an election observer, has represented Vauxhall since 1989.She defended herself in a letter to local party members ahead of Thursday's vote.""The idea there would have been a general election if Labour MPs had supported the amendment is not true,"" she said.The amendment, tabled by pro-EU Tory backbenchers, ""was a backhand way of staying in the customs union,"" she argued, and ""this was not the position in the Labour manifesto on which I was re-elected"".In a statement to the Guardian, Ms Hoey said the result of the no-confidence vote was ""not a surprise"".""My local party activists are solid EU Remainers,"" she told the newspaper. ""I will always put my country before my party and helping my constituents is a priority. ""After 29 years as an MP I am quite relaxed about the vote and it won't influence in any way how I vote in future.""Earlier this week, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said he was seeking to persuade Ms Hoey and three other Labour rebels to stop ""propping up"" the government in key Brexit votes."

2018-07-29,Targeted pro-Brexit Facebook ads revealed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180730051223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44966969,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe official Vote Leave campaign spent more than £2.7m on targeting ads at specific groups of people on Facebook - helping it to win the 2016 EU referendum.The US social media giant has now released these ads to a committee of MPs investigating fake news - meaning everyone, not just those they were originally aimed at, can now see them.The ads, created by Canadian company Aggregate AIQ, often focused on specific issues - such as immigration or animal rights - thought likely to push the buttons of certain groups of people, based on their age, where they lived and other personal data taken from social media and other sources.The 120 pages of documents appear to back up the findings of the Electoral Commission, which ruled last week that Vote Leave broke electoral law by working jointly with another campaign, BeLeave - something denied by both groups.A number of BeLeave ads were sent from the Vote Leave Facebook account, including this one:There are 1,433 different messages in the data set released by Facebook, all with one common theme - although it is not always clear that they have come from a pro-Brexit campaign.Here is one that was targeted at animal lovers:This one, targeted at tea-lovers, is more obviously pro-Brexit:Polar bears were also recruited to the cause:The adverts contained in the Facebook data set were seen more than 169 million times in total. The BeLeave messages were more closely directed at younger voters, promising a ""brighter future"" if the UK could stop ""EU regulators keeping us in the past"" and accusing Brussels of regulating ride-sharing apps such as Uber and enforcing quotas on data streaming.Data provided by Facebook suggests some of the most seen images were produced by BeLeave. This image was displayed on the screens of target audience members more than five million times: Older voters tended to be treated to claims about how much money the UK was sending to the EU. More than 140 ads made reference to the controversial claim that £350m a week sent to the EU could be spent on the NHS instead:Alternative uses for the £350m included schools and flood defences: Vote Leave made the most of then US President Barack Obama's intervention in the referendum campaign, when he said the UK would be at the ""back of the queue"" for trade deals.This ad was heavily targeted at older voters, with a reach of up to 25% among woman aged over 65 and 23% of men in that age group targeted by one version of it (as with many of the ads, the accompanying text was tweaked and refined from a basic ""parent"" ad):Immigration was another common theme, with one ad appearing to suggest the entire Turkish population was headed for the UK: Boris Johnson was the only politician to be pictured in the ads:Apart from one featuring Jeremy Corbyn, which was targeted at younger voters and accompanied by an old quote from the Labour leader: ""The EU takes away from national parliaments the power to set economic policy and hands it over to an unelected set of bankers.""Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party spent £32,750.73 with AIQ on pro-Brexit Facebook ads. Only 16 of the ads were delivered to users in Northern Ireland, according to the Facebook data. The remaining 24 were primarily seen by people in England.The 24 adverts, seen at least 1.96 million times - and potentially as many as 4.2 million times - were all posted in the final three days of the EU referendum campaign.Early on in the campaign, Vote Leave launched a giant data harvesting exercise through a competition to win £50m if you could correctly guess the result of all 51 games in the 2016 European football championship.The odds of winning the contest - which Vote Leave funded through an insurance policy - were calculated at one in 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. It was described by one Vote Leave insider at the time as a potential ""game changer"" because it would allow it to gather the contact details of thousands of potential voters, many of whom would not normally be interested in the referendum.The campaign recruited former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham to promote the contest:A separate group called Veterans for Britain had refused permission for its ads to be passed on, said Facebook.The Culture Media and Sport Committee is expected shortly to publish interim findings from its inquiry into fake news, which has taken evidence from whistleblower Christopher Wylie and technology company bosses as well as representatives of the separate Leave.EU campaign.Correction 27 July 2018: An earlier version of this story said some ads were seen by fewer than 1,000 people, according to the Facebook data, and this was an example of ""micro-targeting"". But former Vote Leave chief, Matthew Elliott, said the ads never ran, so we removed that reference."
2018-07-29,What now for the government?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180730051223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44954369,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWestminster made it to the summer, just. It was messy, sweaty, with an almost daily roll call of nightmares for the government. Senior MPs say privately there were genuine moments, even last week, when various colleagues - not the usual suspects - were agitating to try to remove the prime minister. The government lost an important vote, but scraped through a vital one. The chief whip got caught out with some epic skulduggery. Big cabinet bruisers walked out, trashing the main government policy as they did.As the temperature rose, so did tempers. One senior MP told me that some significant Conservative backers were discussing withholding their next donations to the party because they were so unhappy at how Number 10 has been handling things. There have been plenty of moments of ""it can't go on like this"". But, ""it"" can, and it normally does.After the summer break then, when the prime minister will hope everyone in her party has calmed down, rather than plotted on WhatsApp from their sun loungers, how does the government ""go on like this""? What are the ways through? The first thing to say is that no country has left the European Union before like this. So there is no precedent. There is no map. Whether you find it deeply thrilling, or deeply alarming, ask even those who have held some of the highest offices in the land what happens if it all goes wrong and they don't know. There are, though, scenarios that can be sketched out.This might be fantasy but it's not impossible. Say Theresa May manages to get the EU to broker something on the basis of her latest plan and comes back with what one of her longstanding allies describes as ""Chequers minus minus"". There will likely have to be concessions on giving the EU more cash and more concessions on immigration, but it is a just about swallowable deal. It won't have escaped your notice by now that warnings about ""no deal"" are coming thick and fast, and ever more scarily, from ministers' mouths. This is no coincidence. It is not beyond the wit of man to see that stoking concern about ""no deal"" could, conveniently, encourage MPs to feel they have little choice but to vote for it. However, it is abundantly clear that there is a solid core of Brexiteer Tories who simply would not vote for it. And you can near as dammit be sure that Labour's official position won't be to back the government. One of the Labour leadership team told me: ""We will push her to the brink."" Don't underestimate either the concern that could spread far and wide about whether a deal like that would really be what people had voted for. So far, Number 10's analysis that the majority of people just want the prime minister to get on with Brexit and are not paying huge attention has been shown to be more or less right (not withstanding very vocal groups on either side of the debate). The dynamics of the actual deal might well change that.  But in Parliament, senior backers of Mrs May know that to get the vote through they'd have to rely on many Labour MPs either abstaining or voting with the government. If rejecting the deal feels like opening Pandora's box versus supporting a fudgey compromise, there could well be enough of them to allow Mrs May to squeak through. Maybe. And then, maybe, Europe will go back to being just another issue, albeit an important one.We will be in the EU departure lounge for a couple of years. Trade talks will be tricky, there will be plenty to sort out - but a deal will have been done and the government can, in theory, tell the public we are out, and life can get back to something approaching normal. Hmmm.It's also possible to see how the government does not even get that far. Right now, it seems the prime minister is absolutely intent on getting a deal. Those who know her well (it's not a long list!) say that is what is driving her above all else - getting something done. The mantra ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" has not aged well.But if the further concessions that the rest of the EU demands, for demand they will, are just too intense, requiring too much on immigration, or extra payments, forcing the prime minister not just to pinken her red lines but to scrub them out altogether, then maybe that could change and she could walk away. Right now it seems unlikely, but the chances of no deal have been rising. One diplomat, in sorrow more than anger, last week said to me he simply couldn't see how the EU would be able to offer anything that the prime minister could get through Parliament. Yes, anything that is viable at all.But if there is ""no deal"", and the government actually puts that on the table, it is hard to see Parliament backing that either. Many Tories, including many in government, are talking about when, not if, they make it plain that they would never support leaving without concluding an agreement. Those discussions are taking place, including among some serving ministers. What some Brexiteers have always wanted - a simple free trade deal - does find supporters around the EU. Indeed, one well-placed official suggested to me that if the White Paper wasn't coherent or workable, and the jury is very much out on that, then the EU could simply say in October, it's a basic deal on trade or nothing. Some Brexiteers would rejoice. But that would also have to come with the backstop to prevent a hard border in Ireland, which right now, despite all sorts of ideas being floated, is still a huge obstacle to getting a deal done. The prime minister says she simply couldn't sign up to it. And until there is a shift - or a magical solution - that way through the quagmire is out of reach. And indeed, if it becomes obvious in the autumn that the prime minister wants to sign something that is even more of a compromise than Chequers, then her nemesis, the Eurosceptics, might try to oust her well before she gets to bring the deal to Parliament. Then we are properly in a land where anything is possible. The Article 50 process is a legal mechanism, with a fixed deadline. But if the ruling party crashed into a leadership contest? If there was no one to negotiate with? Who knows? Could that mean a general election? Perhaps, a second referendum? Not out of the question. The People's Vote campaign pushing for this are stepping up their activities - not just in Westminster but around the country. By the time we sign off next summer, the government could have just navigated its way through the most complicated and troublesome political waters in decades. Or there could be a new prime minister, and the Conservative Party might have actually succeeded in smashing itself to bits. It will be 13 years then since David Cameron vowed the Tories would ""stop banging on about Europe"". It seems deeply optimistic to imagine that by then, they will have been able to move on. I, however, for the next few weeks won't be banging on about anything. It's the political holidays. Thank you for reading this page through another epic political year, and I'll see you on the other side when, the only thing I am really sure of, there will be plenty more to discuss. "
2018-07-29,Private probation contracts to end early,https://web.archive.org//web/20180730051223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44973258,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPrivate companies that run probation services are to have their government contracts ended early - after MPs said the system for supervising criminals was in a ""mess"".The contracts began in 2015 to manage low-risk offenders in England and Wales, under a partial privatisation by then-Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.Ministers are proposing further changes and private firms will remain involved.But Labour said the costly contracts had created an  ""unprecedented crisis"".It comes after the Commons justice committee said in July that changes to probation had failed, and it was unconvinced private sector firms could ever deliver an effective service.BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the government had hoped that shaking up probation would result in less reoffending. The number of people reoffending has reduced slightly, but those that do are committing crimes more frequently.  The arrangements for managing offenders were overhauled in 2014, with the probation service split in two. A new state body, the National Probation Service (NPS), was set up to supervise high-risk offenders, with 21 privately run Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) supervising low and medium-risk offenders.But David Gauke, who became justice secretary in January, said that while the £3.7bn Transforming Rehabilitation (TR) programme had been ambitious and innovative, several CRCs had made ""very substantial losses"".Mr Gauke said the amount of work available for the CRCs had been ""lower than anticipated and that has had an impact in terms of their income and the services they are able to provide"".He also said he was determined to have a service that reduced reoffending, and could oversee ""tough"" community sentences with less reliance on ""ineffective"" short prison terms.Existing contracts will now end two years early, in 2020 - and will be replaced with 10 new ones under changes that will cost the government £170m. This includes £110m that the CRCs owe the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) in fines for failing to meet performance targets - but which they will be allowed to reinvest in services to keep them going for the last two years of their agreements.The MoJ will also pay £46m over the next two years for services that help offenders immediately after they are released from prison.The MoJ said it had budgeted to pay firms £2.5bn by 2020 but had only paid out £2.2bn - a saving of £300m - because less work than anticipated was allocated to the CRCs.This was because there was an increase in the proportion of serious offences which they were ineligible to work on.Mr Gauke said new contracts would make better use of offending data and would move towards ""payment for services delivered"", but he ruled out allowing CRCs to take on high-risk cases.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said: ""This decision to throw more good money after bad and the government's re-commitment to a privately-run probation service shows that the Conservatives have run out of all ideas on how to fix their broken system."" And the GMB union said the probation officers it represented were overworked and demoralised. GMB national officer George Georgiou said: ""Fragmenting the service has moved us away from a coherent national workforce strategy for the entire probation service.""But the government's proposals were welcomed by the chief probation inspector, Dame Glenys Stacey.Dame Glenys, who was critical of probation services in her report in December, said: ""There is much to welcome in these proposals, and we are pleased to see that our inspection evidence and findings and our wider advice have had significant influence and impact."""

But many people do not fit neatly into either category, throwing up complex and unexpected dilemmas for both the Home Office and the individuals concerned.Some, such as Ursula Crosby, who contacted the BBC with her story, have been unable to get a clear answer about how to secure residency rights, and citizenship, when Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Ms Crosby retired to Portugal five years ago after 40 years of working as a physiotherapist in NHS hospitals, in London and Shrewsbury. She says she felt like spreading her wings and ""doing something a bit different"" while she could.She is a German citizen but under free movement rules she had the security of knowing she could return to the UK, where her daughter lives and where she still owns property, when she wanted to.Brexit has changed that. The UK has told EU citizens they will be able to apply for ""settled status"" if they have been living in the UK for five years or have been granted indefinite leave to remain. It is unclear how this will apply to Ms Crosby, who was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 1979. Indefinite leave to remain - despite the name - usually expires if you have left the country for two years or more, as is the case with Ms Crosby. She has received conflicting advice from UK officials about whether she would qualify for settled status and no-one has been able to tell her what will happen if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. For all the government's assurances about how easy it will be for EU citizens after Brexit, getting a straight answer on all but the most straightforward of cases is very difficult, if the experience of researching this article is anything to go by.At one point, Ms Crosby was referred to an independent immigration adviser, who told her she would be all right because Britain would probably stay in the European Economic Area after Brexit - which would be news to Prime Minister Theresa May, who has repeatedly ruled that out.She is now torn between selling up and moving back to the UK before Britain leaves the EU in March, or risking moving back at a later date, during the 21-month transition period that will follow Brexit, in the hope that she can still secure settled status.""I am sure I could live in Germany but I wouldn't really want to live in Germany,"" says the 68-year-old. ""I no longer have any connections there, as such. My parents are dead. I have a cousin in Germany. ""I could stay in Portugal but I am not sure I would want to. It was never my intention to and I still have property in England.""If I ask anybody who meets me, they all think I am British.""She first came to the UK in 1971, on a work permit, long before EU free movement rules came into force, and was married to a British man for many years.She now regrets not applying for British citizenship when she had the chance but, like many others, she did not think she needed to.""There are probably quite a lot of people in this situation,"" says immigration lawyer Colin Yeo, ""people that used to live in the UK, perhaps for a very long time, who were assuming they would be able to come back to the UK because it is a member of the EU.""They will probably be all right if they come back during the transition period.""But, he adds, many will feel ""they have got to come back now or they will lose the chance"". Ms Crosby says she can't understand why, as someone in receipt of a full UK state pension, as well as an NHS pension, she may have to wait five years after returning to the UK to qualify for British citizenship, the same as someone from an EU country who has never lived there.""I am an honest person, I have no convictions, I paid my taxes and if I go back I will be able to support myself. Am I doing any harm?"" she says.The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases, but a spokeswoman said: ""After we leave the EU, in March 2019, there will be an implementation period that ends on 31 December 2020, during which EU citizens and their family members will be free to live, work and study in the UK as they do now. ""EU citizens and their family members who become resident in the UK during the implementation period will be able to make an application to the EU Settlement Scheme and be eligible for temporary leave to remain and, after five years' lawful residence, settled status, under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement. ""The rights of those EU citizens arriving during the implementation period will be safeguarded on the same terms as has been agreed for those EU citizens resident in the UK before we leave the EU.""Ms Crosby remains unconvinced by the Home Office's reassurances - and she has written to the department to try to get some clear guidance on what she should do next.""I am not sure I can rely on the immigration system to relax their very inflexible rules,"" she says.""My worst fear is that I sell up here, move back to England and then find out that it would not have been necessary."""
2018-07-29,Pollwatch: The Chequers effect,https://web.archive.org//web/20180730051223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44937732,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs are leaving Westminster for the summer recess. What's happened in the opinion polls and what can they tell us about what could happen when Parliament returns in the autumn?Please enable Javascript to view our poll tracker.In the first six months of 2018 the Westminster voting intention opinion polls were rather dull. But since the cabinet awayday at Chequers on 6 July, and the publication of the government's Brexit white paper the following week, there has been a marked change.For months the polls only moved very gradually. Between January and the beginning of July support for Labour dipped a couple of percentage points whilst the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats went up by about one per cent each.That did mean the Tories were fairly reliably in the lead, but only narrowly. Then came Chequers - and the calm of the first half of the year came to an abrupt end.The Conservatives have seen their rating fall back. In a couple of polls they've been at 36%, their lowest level since last year's general election.As a result, Labour has moved ahead in a sequence of polls for the first time since February.The other beneficiaries of the Conservative drop are UKIP. Until Chequers they'd not topped 5% this year. They've been above that in each of the last five published polls.None of this should be exaggerated. The movements aren't massive. But after months where changes happened at a snail's pace, it's a striking development.It could yet turn out that this is just a blip. The absence of warring Conservative MPs from Westminster might see the public's view of the party improve. But if it is a blip, it's a pretty big one.And it potentially foreshadows further turbulence in the autumn when Theresa May and the EU hope to finalise a Brexit deal.To see how difficult the prime minister's task is on Brexit just look at polls about it.Voters remain pretty evenly split about whether it was a good decision.We've seen a continuation of the trend from 2017. Over time, the number of people who say that Brexit was the wrong decision has very gradually increased, but there's no sign of a consensus forming.Worse still for the prime minister, polls which seek to capture what people think should happen next suggest an even more divided public.An interesting poll by new polling firm Deltapoll asked precisely that question: According to this poll, there's no course of action which has the support of even a third of voters. That could cause problems for Theresa May. It's going to be very hard for her to please a majority of the public whatever she does."

The Sun said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was a ""big mouth and a fool"". ""It has exposed beyond doubt both his crass naivety and the cynical deceit of the EU masters he cravenly obeys,"" said an editorial in the paperBut what are the facts in the case? Speaking at a press conference in County Kerry on 18 July, Leo Varadkar said a no-deal Brexit would see Britain leave the Single European Sky programme, which co-ordinates flights in Europe.""If they want their planes to fly over our sky, they would need to take that into account,"" he said.Tomorrow's front page: The Irish PM was branded ""mad"" last night for threatening to block British planes flying over his country. https://t.co/r3aFRhfiM2 pic.twitter.com/DQ6LJqbl5GEnd of Twitter post  by @TheSun""The situation at the moment is that the UK is part of the Single European Sky and if they leave the EU they are not.""And that does mean if there was a no-deal hard Brexit next March, the planes would not fly and Britain would be an island in many ways - and that is something they need to think about.""Leo Varadkar was wrong to suggest British aircraft would be barred from Irish airspace in the event of a no-deal Brexit, according to Downing Street.So-called ""overflight rights"" are guaranteed by international treaties rather than EU membership, said a Number 10 spokeswoman. The spokeswoman said the UK was confident of reaching a deal that included ""aviation access"".""It's wrong to claim that Ireland could simply stop the UK from flying over its land as a result of Brexit.""The reason we say that is because overflight rights are not guaranteed by the EU, rather by multilateral treaty which both ourselves and Ireland have signed up to.""The international treaty referred to by the UK government is the Chicago Convention which 52 states signed on 7 December 1944.It effectively guarantees the right of civil aviation to fly over the air space of signatory states without permission, but not necessarily to land. As Mr Varadkar talks about ""planes flying over our sky"", he is probably wrong on that point - and the UK government correct.However, the real issue would be planes landing and taking off at EU airports if the UK leaves European Single Sky and the European Aviation Safety Agency with no deal to replace their regulations.Mr Varadkar was speaking in terms of a ""no-deal Brexit"", while the UK government was responding in terms of reaching a deal. His ""planes would not fly"" remark could in theory become a reality if there was no deal, the need for which is tacitly implied in the UK statement. The Sun certainly took Mr Varadkar's comments as a threat, as did some unionist politicians in Northern Ireland. ""Given that the Irish State is dependent on the RAF for its air defence in the event of a terrorist attack it is obviously exceedingly unwise for  Varadkar to pompously and arrogantly suggest that Dublin could deny civilian aircraft from the UK access to Irish airspace,"" said Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister. DUP MLA Christopher Stalford countered that the Republic of Ireland gets its gas supply through the UK.Where the Republic of Ireland gets its gas from. Remember this the next time Leo decides to threaten the UK over airspace. pic.twitter.com/DR08JCtViNEnd of Twitter post  by @CStalfordMLA""Remember this the next time Leo decides to threaten the UK over airspace,"" he tweeted.In fact, the Republic of Ireland is on course to get the majority of its gas from Irish sources within the next few years.However Mr Varadkar was defended on social media by the Irish government's spokesperson on the EU""To be fair he merely reiterated a factual statement that Philip Hammond also made earlier this year,"" said Senator Neale Richmond. Eamonn Brennan, chief executive of the Irish Aviation Authority said as early as February 2017: ""Air connectivity all over the world is based on Air Service Agreements and once the UK leaves the EU a new Air Service Agreement will have to be put in place between the EU27 and the UK.Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair, has repeatedly warned that the UK is running out of time to agree a new open skies agreement with the EU, saying there is a ""real prospect"" that there will be no flights between the UK and Europe for a period beyond March 2019.In July 2017, the head of the Aerospace body ADS said that the UK must remain an EU member during a post-Brexit transition period.Aviation expert Paul Everitt said the UK would struggle to sign the necessary agreements with global safety regulators before then, risking disruption to air travel.""If we don't have a transition arrangement and if we aren't a member of the EU as part of that transitional arrangement, then we have chaos because we don't have a system to ensure that our products are safe and secure to fly and a regime that is acknowledged around the world,"" he said.Aviation consultant John Strickland said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the current aviation traffic rights framework would no longer apply.""Theoretically, at midnight on that day planes would be grounded,"" he said.But he questioned the likelihood of that happening. ""Even if technically a deal comes to an end it wouldn't be logical that you would just accept that that commercial airline traffic stops just to make a political point because you would be starving the economy,"" he added.""Whether you are on the UK side, or the Irish side, or the remain side, or the leave side… I don't see anybody that wins from the suspension of air services."""
2018-07-29,FOI failings,https://web.archive.org//web/20180730051223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44864770,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMajor government departments are continuing to demonstrate persistent delays and unhelpfulness in their responses to information requests, according to research conducted by the BBC. Last June we reported on how the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Cabinet Office were frequently criticised by the Information Commissioner for their inadequate handling of FOI applications. Our analysis of decisions issued since then by the commissioner shows that the poor performance of these three departments has continued.The Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is being criticised by openness campaigners for not taking stronger action over the repeated failings. The Home Office has a particularly extreme record and has been rebuked by the Information Commissioner's Office in several dozen cases over the past 12 months.The ICO describes delays faced by requesters to the Home Office in various cases as ""unacceptable"", ""extremely lengthy"", ""particularly severe"" and ""inexplicable and unjustifiable"".In some instances the Home Office took several months to reach a decision and reply. In numerous other cases it failed to respond at all. The commissioner also reprimanded the Home Office over responses which were ""unhelpful"", showed ""poor handling"", ""did not provide any explanation"" or which contained a ""lack of detail"", ""no reasoning"", an ""extremely disappointing rationale"", or information which was ""not accurate"".Numerous ICO decision notices contain statements along the lines that the commissioner has made a record of the problem and that ""this issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases suggest that this is necessary"" or ""this may form evidence in future enforcement action against the HO should evidence from other cases suggest that there are systemic issues within the HO that are causing delays"".Since this is often repeated in the ICO decisions, it is not clear what further evidence of ""systemic issues"" ought to be required. The Ministry of Justice has also been frequently rebuked by the Commissioner for its failures to comply with the FOI law. The ICO criticises the ministry over delays which were ""very considerable"", ""far in excess of the requirement"", ""extremely lengthy"" and ""grossly excessive and entirely unacceptable"".As with the Home Office, there are numerous cases where the Ministry of Justice failed to send any response before the ICO's formal decision was issued. Similarly, many decision notices repeat the familiar statement that the failing has been noted and the issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases indicate there are systemic issues A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""We received nearly 5,000 FOI requests last year, one of the highest figures across Whitehall. We surpassed the ICO's high target for response times last year and have improved even further since - responding to 93% of requests on time in the latest figures.""The Cabinet Office also comes in for continuing criticism over its poor record on FOI.  This includes delays which were ""clearly against the spirit and intention of FOIA"", ""excessive"" and ""unacceptable"".It is also reprimanded for ""poorly conceived submissions"", lack of ""meaningful detail"", being ""illogical"", ""erroneous"", ""unsustainable"", providing ""generic"" arguments, handling which ""clearly fell short"", and having ""wrongly interpreted"" correspondence from a requester.This is despite the fact that the Cabinet Office is responsible for government FOI policy and should therefore set an example to other public authorities.Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information said that Elizabeth Denham should take stronger action: ""Departments have discovered that they can repeatedly ignore the regulator - and nothing happens. The solution is in the commissioner's hands. She should promptly serve chronic offenders with enforcement notices and threaten court action if they fail to comply.""She should also report the problem to Parliament and encourage a select committee to ask ministers in front of the TV cameras why they are treating the public's right to know with contempt.""An ICO spokesperson said: ""The ICO can take monitoring action if a public authority's performance needs to improve. Whether or not disclosure applies to a request is not always straightforward. That is why we work with departments to improve processes so decisions on what information can be released under FOI can be made more effectively and efficiently.""Requests to these departments which have been badly affected by delays include some submitted by myself and by BBC colleagues. The government departments involved have been approached for comment.Research by Patrick Cowling"

The UK would fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global body governing international trade.UK exports to the EU would be subject to the same customs checks and taxes the EU currently imposes on countries like the United States.Those arguing for this option - the so-called ""hard Brexiteers"" - say it would create a truly independent nation able to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world.But opponents say it would be catastrophic for British business and have warned about chaos at the borders, higher food prices and shortages in the shops.  The UK has formally triggered the mechanism to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019.To reverse that at this late stage would mean a huge loss of political face, and probably require a new prime minister, with the backing of voters in a general election. European Council President Donald Tusk has said he believes Brexit can be halted - but there is some debate about whether the Article 50 process, the two-year legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU, is reversible. (You can read a full BBC Reality Check on the debate here.) If the UK did leave and wanted to immediately rejoin, it would need all the other EU member states to agree.A less formal version of staying in the EU would be if the UK strikes a deal that keeps it in the EU's trade arrangements - the customs union and the single market - and agrees to free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This would amount to staying in the EU, Brexiteers argue.The UK government has ruled this out but there have been a number of people calling for a fresh vote - including Justine Greening.With Parliament apparently split over what kind of Brexit it wants, a referendum on the final deal agreed by Theresa May in Brussels might yet end up being the only way to break the deadlock. Those campaigning for another referendum say voters should get the final say, including the option of staying in. Labour's leadership say a general election should be held rather than another referendum.Please upgrade your browser"
2018-07-29,Maastricht battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20180730051223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44924844,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNewly released files show how, behind the scenes, John Major decided how to overcome Conservative MPs who voted against the Maastricht treaty in July 1993.Summertime, Conservative civil war over Europe, and Rees-Mogg challenging the prime minister's European plans - but this wasn't Theresa May and Jacob Rees-Mogg but her predecessor, John Major, and his father, William, Lord Rees-Mogg. And the battle was not over Brexit but the Maastricht treaty. This was the agreement that turned the European Community into the European Union (EU) and laid the foundations for the European single currency, the euro.John Major had hailed the treaty, agreed in December 1991 by the then 12 member states, as a good deal for Britain. He praised the opportunities he believed a single market in goods and services, and the free movement of labour, offered. And he believed that a concession, allowing the UK to decide whether, not when, to join a single European currency, was key.Eurosceptic MPs said the treaty would give the EU greater powers at the expense of Westminster. They saw it as a step down the road to a centralised federal EU. And they were implacably opposed the UK joining a single European currency.In the Lords, the former Conservative Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher said that the treaty would ""diminish democracy and increase bureaucracy"".Lord Rees-Mogg went to court to stop the Maastricht treaty from becoming UK law - but judges supported the government's position, on all the issues. ""The outcome was even better than our lawyers had expected,"" Sir Roderic Lyne wrote on a note. He pointed out that Douglas Hurd, then Foreign Secretary, was ""exercising restraint"" in public as he did not want to ""provoke the Rees-Mogg brigade"" into ""further Quixotic action"".John Major enjoyed the moment. ""Good,"" he wrote on the document, ""a full gloat is merited.""Getting the treaty through the Commons took a year. Those who opposed it, from the Labour as well as Conservative benches, were vocal and well organised. But by July 1993 the end of the process was in sight.""It was the toughest time I spent in Downing Street,"" says Sir Roderic, who was John Major's private secretary at the time. ""I remember it as a nightmare.""John Major's strategy as the final vote loomed was a risky one. He would, if needed, call for a motion of confidence. If he had lost, the government would have fallen. It was, in effect, the ""nuclear option"" - either back me or face a general election.On 22 July 1993, after a series of close votes, the government lost the main motion. The ratification of the Maastricht treaty had been blocked.Then, in a moment of the highest political drama, John Major stood up at the dispatch box and announced there would be a vote of confidence in the government the following day, which would also act as a vote to write the treaty into UK law.Seeing all the papers reminds Sir Roderic of how much complex information the prime minister had to digest. ""John Major has an incredibly quick brain"" he says. ""He has a mind like a high-speed computer.""He recalls how on 21 July John Major had been depressed, knowing he had lost the first vote. He tried to work on a speech for the next day but lacked energy and went to bed. ""Everyone expected disaster,"" Sir Roderic says. Yet when he returned to Number 10 first thing next morning, the prime minister was ""perky"".""He had the glint of battle in his eye.""John Major had worked out his plan to call for confidence motion and had held three cabinet meetings to get his ministers to agree.His approach worked - opponents in his own party wouldn't vote against the government in a confidence vote. ""He basically lined the rebels up against a wall and aimed machine guns at them,"" as Sir Roderic puts it.The vote was won, by 339 to 299. John Major and his staff celebrated in his parliamentary office with champagne and congratulations arrived from European politicians. Albert Reynolds, the Irish Prime Minister, was friendly with Mr Major and sent a message saying: ""Well done.""Now keep your head down and drive on."" Sir Roderic Lyne is reluctant to draw too many parallels between then and now. ""Theresa May is unbelievably resilient I think,"" he says. ""Her problem is far worse than Major. He was attacked by 25 MPs. She's under fire from both right and left. And while for us, the real pressure came in the last stages, she's had it for two years."""
2018-07-29,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180730051223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-29,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180730051223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

""But I accept that what I did say, and the way I said it, fell short of the requirement, which I accept, for discussions of contentious issues to be conducted in a fully civil and respectful way.

Relatives who have faced the court process in the past said the ruling would help families dealing with a ""tragic situation"".But anti-assisted dying campaigners said vegetative patients are ""effectively going to be starved and dehydrated to death"". Previously the Court of Protection has ruled on cases but the process can take months or years, and it costs health authorities about £50,000 in legal fees to lodge an appeal.The ruling could have an impact on the thousands of families whose loved ones are in a vegetative state. There is estimated to be 1,500 new cases each year in England and Wales which would be affected, with about 3,000 of these patients alive at any one time. The case was brought to the Supreme Court after a banker in his 50s suffered a heart attack, resulting in severe brain damage. The man, known as Mr Y, was unresponsive after his heart attack last year and there was no chance of recovery.His family and his doctors agreed it would be in his best interests to allow him to die by withdrawing his feeding tube.The NHS trust asked the High Court to declare that it was not necessary to apply to the Court of Protection for a decision when the doctors and the family all believe it is in the patient's best interests.The judge agreed, but the official solicitor appealed on behalf of Mr Y - an appeal which has now been dismissed.Mr Y has since died but the case continued so that a court ruling could be made. By BBC legal correspondent Clive ColemanFor years -  so long as relatives agree, and it's in the best interests of a patient in a minimally conscious or vegetative state - doctors have been able to withdraw all sorts of treatment that will result in the end of someone's life. These include, for instance, the withdrawal of life-saving dialysis. Doctors do not need the permission of a court to be able to do this.However, withdrawing food and water - the most basic requirements for life - has been handled differently. Since the case of Hillsborough survivor Anthony Bland in 1993, it has been regarded as a matter of practice that doctors must seek the approval of a court, even when they and relatives agree withdrawal would be in the best interests of the patient. It has been treated as an exception, in part, perhaps, because of the emotional and psychological significance of the decision to remove sustenance from a person. This has resulted, some experts believe, in individuals spending longer on life support in a vegetative state than was necessary because hospitals have shied away from going to court due to the expense and bureaucracy involved.Monday's ruling makes clear that courts need not be involved in these sorts of cases, so long as doctors and families are in agreement, and it is in the best interests of the patient.  However, the judgement cuts across ethical and religious beliefs and will divide opinion.  Some will see it as compassionate and humane, others the removing of a vital legal safeguard for a highly vulnerable group. Author Cathy Rentzenbrink welcomed the ruling.Her brother Matty was severely brain damaged in a hit-and-run accident when he was 16 years old. He spent eight years in a vegetative state, and she says her family had to go through a painful process of allowing the court to allow food and water to be withdrawn so he could die in 1998.Ms Rentzenbrink, who wrote a book about her experience, told the BBC: ""For families to be put through a court case, on top of everything else that has happened to them, is a struggle.""She said not having to face a court would help families already facing an ""incredibly difficult"" time.She said one of the ""difficult things"" about her experience in court was being made to swear an affidavit that she wanted her brother to die.""I didn't want my brother to die. I wanted him to get better,"" she said. ""I wanted him not to be knocked over in the first place - but I couldn't have any of those things.""She said: ""For all the families in this situation, they don't want to have to go to court and say they want someone to die.""The right to withdraw treatment from vegetative patients began in 1993 with Tony Bland, who had been in a vegetative state since 1989, until the House of Lords agreed that removing ""clinically assisted nutrition and hydration"" - where a patient is fed through tubes - did not constitute murder. But they did say referring similar cases to the Court of Protection was best practice. In Monday's Supreme Court judgement, Lady Black said an agreement between families and doctors was sufficient safeguarding to ensure ""public confidence"". But she urged families to apply to court ""where there are differences of view"" between relatives or medical professionals.Source: NHS ChoicesDr Peter Saunders, director of anti-assisted dying group Care Not Killing, said he was ""very concerned and quite disappointed by the Supreme Court ruling"" on ending care for vegetative patients, who are ""effectively going to be starved and dehydrated to death"".He said it removed an ""additional layer"" of protection for vulnerable, and ""financial concerns"" about looking after vegetative patients could mean ""decisions may be made for the wrong reasons"". But the charity Compassion in Dying said it would ""allow those closest to a person - their loved ones and medical team - to feel supported and empowered to make the right decision for the person, even when it is a difficult one""."

2018-07-30,Cancelled Northern rail services resume,https://web.archive.org//web/20180731071826/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cumbria-44997743,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowServices cancelled following a timetable shake-up at Northern rail have begun running again.Northern scrapped 168 services per day last month to try to relieve chaos caused by the timetable's introduction in May.Services in Manchester, Merseyside and Lancashire are partially resuming while all trains on the Lakes Line, in the Lake District, are being reinstated.The remaining 25% of its cancelled trains do not restart until September.The company, which has faced calls for it to be stripped of its franchise, says a ""more gradual"" reintroduction will ensure a more stable and reliable service. However, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has written to the prime minister, asking her to personally intervene over the ""chaos"" caused by Northern this summer.He said: ""People could have legitimately expected, when fewer trains were running, that at least the ones that were running would be on time, well they haven't been. The emergency timetable didn't solve anything.""And then on Saturday night, nine o'clock an email lands saying Northern will cancel 47 services tomorrow so we can get trains in the right place for Monday morning.""Even if trains do run better today it's because there were no services yesterday. ""Speak to any commuter in the north west of England and they will tell you that Northern services were poor for a long time before the new timetable came in and they haven't got much better in the two months since.  ""If you turn up at a train station it's effectively a lottery.""A government spokesman said: ""The disruption that Northern passengers have experienced is unacceptable and it is vital that services continue to improve and passengers are compensated fully.""Thousands of passengers have applied for compensation from Northern, which made the first pay-outs last week.David Brown, managing director at Northern, said the cancellations since 4 June had been an attempt to alleviate ""significant disruption"" caused by the nationwide introduction of the new timetable in May. He added: ""Whilst we are ready to reintroduce all 168 daily services, given the need to drive further improvements across Manchester, we have agreed to a more gradual reintroduction of our services.""A phased introduction is the right approach to ensure a more stable and reliable service for customers.""In May, what was billed as the biggest ever overhaul of rail timetables led to significant and widespread rail disruption.The timetable overhaul - for Northern as well as Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) lines - was aimed at improving punctuality and boosting capacity, but instead led to a huge number of train services being cancelled or severely delayed.Northern and GTR had to remove hundreds of trains in a temporary timetable change to deal with the chaos on the rail network.Last month, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling defended his handling of the saga and announced an inquiry into what went wrong.The inquiry, by transport professor Stephen Glaister, will look at the implementation of the new timetable. A final report will be published by December.The Transport Select Committee is also asking for evidence from passengers and as well as rail industry groups.Train timetables are usually changed twice a year, in summer and winter, but normally on a much smaller scale.A rail timetable overhaul planned for December has since been scaled back amid fears of a repeat of the chaos seen in May."
2018-07-30,Prime ministers and their holiday snaps,https://web.archive.org//web/20180731071826/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45006490,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May is taking a break - holidaying with husband Philip on the shores of Lake Garda in northern Italy.The prime minister will be glad of an interlude from the row inside the Conservative Party over Brexit.She's spending about a week in Italy, returning to the UK for some official duties then heading to Switzerland for a walking holiday.Sound familiar? It's almost a carbon copy of last year's itinerary - right down to the unwelcome headlines about Brexit divisions.The current occupants of 10 Downing Street are clearly creatures of habit when it comes to their holidays. We're not saying they're stuck for ideas, but here are some other options for prime ministerial vacations:The prime minister remains in charge even when on holiday - although cabinet ministers deputise for them while they are away."
2018-07-30,Tories delete 'Love Island' bottles promotion,https://web.archive.org//web/20180731071826/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45010807,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Conservative Party has deleted a Love Island water bottle promotion it launched to mark the show's final.The Tories had promised ""Love Island water bottles"" to Instagram followers, featuring phrases like ""don't let Corbyn mug you off"".The bottles in question looked different to the official version - and the promotion was later reworded, with references to the hit ITV2 show removed.An hour later the post was deleted completely.The original offer appeared on the party's Instagram story earlier on Monday alongside the hashtags #FreeMerch, #FinalCountdown and, in what is perhaps a first for the governing party, #DontBeAMelt.To stand a chance of getting one of the ""limited number"" of bottles available people have to enter their email address.As political campaigning increasingly takes place online, all major parties have been using innovative ways to acquire supporters' email addresses.And Love Island has had its political moments this year. Last month, a clip of Love Island contestants discussing Brexit - and its potential impact on trees and cheese - went viral on social media.After leaving the show, Hayley Hughes then got the chance to put some of her Brexit questions to a BBC reporter, and discussed the issue with senior Remain and Leave figures on the Daily Politics programme.Another contestant, Zara McDermott, joined the island after working as a policy adviser for the Department of Education. She later told BBC Radio 5 live that she wants to return to politics.At last year's general election, judging by polls, the Conservative Party performed less well with younger voters than Labour did.Jeremy Corbyn's party spent less money on social media advertising but their posts were far more widely shared and discussed online.  Earlier this year I had a look at who spent what on Facebook during the 2017 election campaign.Since then the Tories have made an effort to improve their online operation, such as running training sessions for MPs on how to use Instagram.To enter the Love Island water bottle promotion, followers must enter their personal details including an email address.Collecting email addresses is increasingly important to political campaigns - but with new restrictions since 'GDPR' rules came into force in May.There is no suggestion the Conservatives' promotion flouts these rules as it is clearly stated that the data will be collected by the party and shared with officials.The post also links to a longer privacy statement on the party's website.The Labour Party has also run promotions which seem designed to collect supporters' email addresses, such as ""what number baby born on the NHS are you?""Earlier this year to mark the hundredth anniversary of some women getting the vote, Labour created an online tool which displays how many MPs in history have shared a particular name.As expected, some names have been rather more common than others on the House of Commons' green benches.Although this tool does not ask for an email address to enter, users are then prompted to ""take the next step with us"", which involves signing up as a supporter and sharing personal data.The winners of Love Island are due to be crowned on Monday night's edition of the show on ITV2, from 21:00 BST."
2018-07-30,Green Party's NI leader to step down,https://web.archive.org//web/20180731071826/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-45000499,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe leader of the Green Party in Northern Ireland, Steven Agnew, has confirmed he will step down from the role in the autumn.The 38 year old, who has led the party for seven years, said the absence of devolved government at Stormont meant the ""game has changed"".He added that he wanted to spend more time with his two young children.Although he is giving up his leadership role, he will continue to hold his post as an assembly member for North Down.""I have decided to make way for a new leader partly because it's what's best for the Green Party and partly because it's what's best for my family,"" he said.""There is a new zeal, energy and drive among grassroots party members and I think a new leader can really shape that and drive that forward.""Assembly members have not been able to take their seats at Stormont since January 2017, when the power-sharing executive, led by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin, collapsed.Earlier this year, Mr Agnew told his annual party conference that Sinn Féin and the DUP had ""destroyed our assembly"" and that local councils should be given a greater role in the absence of devolution.Assembly members are still receiving full pay but in December last year, a government-ordered review recommended cutting their salaries by £13,612 as they were not taking their seats.The following month, the Sunday Times reported that the Green Party leader was searching for part-time work before the expected pay cut.The paper quoted him explaining that had taken the decision because he had ""two kids to care for and bills to pay"".In a statement on Monday, Mr Agnew said his resignation was partly due to family reasons.""The party leadership brings with it extra hours and commitments,"" he said. ""My children are both in primary school now and I want to dedicate that extra time and energy to them. I used to go to bed thinking about the Green Party and waken up thinking about the Green Party. ""I now go to bed thinking about my kids and waken up thinking about them. That has really influenced my thinking.""Mr Agnew added that he was ""proud"" of his achievements as party leader.  ""It's been emotional to look back at almost eight years of leadership but I'm proud of how the party has surged forward with a four-fold increase in membership and the positive change we have made during that time.""Mr Agnew, who worked with the homeless before entering politics, joined the Green Party in 2003 after meeting the then leader Dr John Barry at a protest against the Iraq War.He was elected leader of the party in 2011 and that same year, he was the first assembly member to bring a motion calling for same-sex marriage to be legalised.In 2015, he succeeded in getting the assembly to pass the Children's Services Co-Operation Bill, which placed a legal duty on government agencies to co-operate when it came to children's services.""I'm proud of my record including delivering the Children's Act, leading on marriage equality and environmental justice and continually pushing for transparency and accountability in government,"" he said.""The dynamic has shifted in the absence of devolved government for the last 18 months and we haven't been able to pursue our agenda through the assembly. ""I measure my success through the positive change that I've been able to make but now the game has changed.""He added that his main strength was ""delivering as a parliamentarian"" and he wants to see devolution restored so he can represent his constituents in the chamber.It is the second change to the party's leadership team in less than a year.Last autumn, Claire Bailey stepped down as deputy leader and was replaced by Tanya Jones."

Separate figures released in January showed that while the number of young people arrested fell 79% in the last 10 years, there has also been a rise in violent offences among people under the age of 18.The Early Intervention Youth Fund was originally announced in March by then Home Secretary Amber Rudd as part of the government's strategy to cut violent crime.The strategy highlighted the problem of gangs that recruit children as drug couriers and the online ""glamourisation"" of crime.Sports and mentoring schemes could benefit from the new fund.Mr Javid said: ""Intervening early in the lives of vulnerable young people can help focus their talents on positive activities and steer them away from the dangers of serious violence.""The fund will support groups at the heart of our communities who educate and interact with youths - and provide them with an alternative to crime.""The government had faced criticism that some of the rise in violent crime has been caused by a lack of youth services.In February, when London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced £45m would be spent on helping young people in London at risk of being caught up in crime in the next three years he said council youth services had been ""decimated"" by a fall in government funding."
2018-07-30,MP faces action in Labour anti-Semitism row,https://web.archive.org//web/20180731071826/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44997634,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA Labour MP who is being investigated over his behaviour during a row about the party's anti-Semitism code has denied ""screaming"" abuse.Ian Austin is facing possible suspension after the argument with the party's chairman Ian Lavery.The MP for Dudley North, who is the adopted child of a Jewish refugee, said it was a ""heated discussion"" about how the party tackles anti-Semitism.He told BBC Radio 4 he called the anti-Semitism code of conduct a ""disgrace"".But he added: ""Did I scream abuse at anybody? No I didn't.""A Labour spokesperson, responding to the incident, said the party takes all complaints extremely seriously, adding: ""These are fully investigated in line with party rules and procedures"".Labour's code of conduct was drawn up earlier this month and followed allegations of anti-Semitism within party ranks.The code does reproduce the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and lists behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic. But Jewish leaders and some Labour MPs have been critical, pointing out the code does not include four working examples provided by the IHRA definition. They say the party should adopt these examples in complete form from the IHRA.Labour says its own wording ""expands on and contextualises"" the IHRA examples.The party has said that while the examples are not reproduced word for word, they are covered elsewhere in the new code and it has produced ""robust, legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases"".The IHRA examples of anti-Semitic behaviour include requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations and comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis.According to the Observer, Mr Austin received a letter warning him he could face disciplinary action following the incident. Speaking to the Radio 4 programme The World This Weekend, Mr Austin denied he was using the ongoing anti-Semitism debate as a way to attack Jeremy Corbyn.Mr Corbyn has repeatedly said anti-Semitism is wrong and it will not be tolerated in the party. Mr Austin said the Labour leader had always been on the ""extreme fringes"" of the party, ""supporting and defending all sorts of extremists and in some cases frankly, anti-Semites"".""That's why I think now that somebody with views and history like his isn't really suited to the leadership of a mainstream political party,"" he said.""Am I upset about anti-Semitism? Yes I am. And I'm upset as well about the leadership's failure, I think refusal really, to deal with this properly.""I grew up listening to my dad tell me how he'd escaped from the Holocaust and how his mum and sisters were murdered in Treblinka [a Nazi death camp] and that led to me joining Labour Party as a teenager determined to fight racism.""""I'm really shocked that a party that has got a proud tradition throughout its entire existence of fighting racism has ended up causing such huge offence and distress to the Jewish community in Britain.""Mr Austin said he was ""ashamed of the Labour Party"", adding: ""We are becoming a different political party. This could just never have happened in the past.""Mr Austin is the second Labour MP to face suspension, after the party launched a disciplinary inquiry into Labour veteran Margaret Hodge.She reportedly swore at Jeremy Corbyn and called him an anti-Semite.Labour's shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said he would not condemn Mr Austin as he ""didn't see what happened"", adding that he hoped the situation could be resolved ""amicably"".""What we need to ensure is that the people who disciplinary action is taken against are the small number in the party who have said or done anti-Semitic things, not those who have strong opinions about things we should all have strong opinions about.""Labour's National Executive Committee approved its new code following continuing criticism of its handling of anti-Jewish discrimination and attitudes within its ranks.After criticism of its code of conduct, the party said it would ""in recognition of the serious concerns expressed... reopen the development of the code"" in consultation with Jewish groups. The party's MPs will vote in September on whether to adopt the full IHRA wording after passing an emergency motion at a meeting on Monday night.Earlier this week, the UK's three main Jewish newspapers united to publish the same front page, warning that a Corbyn-led government would pose an ""existential threat to Jewish life"".Two senior members of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet have also suggested the controversial new code of conduct should be rewritten.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the party's ruling NEC to ""reconsider"" its decision and include the full definition.Barry Gardiner, shadow international trade secretary, said it ""would have been better"" to adopt the IHRA definition in full. Labour MPs Chuka Umunna, Liz Kendall and Anna Turley have also been critical.And five senior Scottish Labour politicians - MSPs Monica Lennon, Jackie Baillie, Anas Sarwar, Daniel Johnson and Colin Smyth - on Sunday said they want the wider party to adopt the wording in full.The Board of Deputies of British Jews said Labour has become a party that ""obstructs measures to counter hatred and punishes those who speak out against it"" and called on Mr Corbyn to lead it out of ""this deep abyss""."

She and Mr Hunt met in 2008, when she was working at Warwick University. They have three children.Mr Hunt was at a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, when he said, in English: ""My wife is Japanese - my wife is Chinese. Sorry, that's a terrible mistake to make.""He explained that he and Mr Wang ""spoke in Japanese at the state banquet"", before going on to say: ""My wife is Chinese and my children are half-Chinese and so we have Chinese grandparents who live in Xian and strong family connections in China.""So why was this such a gaffe?Confusing China with any other country is bad if you're trying to curry favour with the Chinese government. But of all the countries to get confused with, Japan is probably the worst one. That's because the two countries have had a particularly bitter relationship for decades. They fought each other in two Sino-Japanese wars, and are also in a dispute over territory in the East China Sea.Among China's older generation, there are plenty of people who are reluctant to buy Japanese products or go to Japan on holiday - because they accuse Japan of playing down its wartime atrocities.And there were several anti-Japanese protests across China in 2012, when tensions over the disputed islands flared up. It's easy for anyone to make a slip of the tongue, or get confused about someone's ethnicity.Mr Hunt speaks Japanese and worked in Japan - and says he spoke with Mr Wang in Japanese - which might explain why it was on his mind at the meeting.But even then, it's awkward explaining why ""Japanese"" slipped out at a conference with Chinese officials - especially since he was talking about his own wife.Rule #1 as a new Foreign Sec: when reflecting in English with the Chinese on a conversation you had with them in Japanese about your Chinese wife, don’t get any of those mixed up! Apologies to the long-suffering Mrs H...!End of Twitter post  by @Jeremy_HuntSpeaking of which...There's a common joke that East Asians ""all look the same"" - and many East Asians have complained that people make lazy assumptions about what ethnicity they are.For example, I've had people yell ""Konnichiwa"" (a Japanese greeting) at me even though I'm ethnic Chinese, while my British Japanese friend has faced several ""Ni Haos"" (hello in Chinese) from strangers. Most East Asians I know would agree that it's not the worst mistake someone could make - but it's still pretty annoying.Mr Hunt's gaffe may have been an innocent slip of the tongue - but it's a pretty unfortunate mistake to have made in this context.And, more importantly for Mr Hunt - it's not going to impress his hosts, which was the whole point of him mentioning his wife in the first place.Given China's rising status as a world power, and the clout of its consumers, lots of politicians and businesses have been trying to endear themselves to the Chinese. But it's easier said than done. Both Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and French President Emmanuel Macron have tried to impress Chinese audiences by speaking Mandarin - to mixed reviews.And having Chinese family ties doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing with China either.For example, Gary Locke served as the US ambassador to China from 2011 to 2013, and made headlines for being the first Chinese-American in the role.But he still faced criticism from Chinese media, especially when ties were strained - such as when the US embassy in Beijing gave refuge to Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng.State newspaper The Global Times made the point of reminding the public that Mr Locke was just a ""normal"" US politician serving Washington's interests, despite his Chinese ethnicity."
2018-07-30,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180731071826/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45008287,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowClaim: Most major Western European countries would ""only dream"" of having the UK's record on train punctuality and performance.Reality Check verdict: UK passengers are more satisfied with their train service than many of their European neighbours, according to a report from 2013 - although this data is now a little old. But this doesn't necessarily reflect the actual quality of the service. UK trains are similarly punctual to many major Western European countries. They are more heavily used and more expensive, however. Passengers on Northern, covering areas including Manchester, Liverpool and Cumbria, have faced cancelled trains and major delays since a new timetable was introduced in May.Amid the chaos, Robert Nisbet, director of the rail companies' membership body the Rail Delivery Group, told BBC 5 live that the UK's railways were the ""envy"" of Europe.""We're a hugely successful railway in many ways - much more so than many countries in Western Europe who would only dream about having our kind of performance and punctuality records,"" he said.He was referring to a European Commission report, published in 2013, which compared customer satisfaction with rail services across 26 EU countries - excluding Cyprus and Malta which do not have national or regional trains.Looking at overall customer satisfaction with rail services, the UK came second only to Finland.The European Commission's directorate of mobility and transport interviewed 26,034 respondents aged 15 years old or more from different social and demographic groups. They were asked questions about how satisfied they were with things like the punctuality and reliability of services, frequency of trains, stations and facilities on the trains including toilets.Looking only at satisfaction with the punctuality and reliability of trains, the UK did a little worse, coming fourth. But for frequency of trains, it came out top.However, this report - the most recent European comparison available - dates from 2013 and so does not capture any recent disruption, including Northern's cancellations and Southern's recent strike action.Satisfaction ratings also don't necessarily tell you how good a service is in reality.Despite passengers being far more satisfied, more recent research, also from the European Commission, found the punctuality of UK trains was similar to its European neighbours.UK trains were on time about 90% of the time, compared with 91% in France and 93% in Germany - although the countries' definitions of ""on time"" vary. The least punctual trains were in Hungary and Croatia. A far higher proportion of UK trains were cancelled than in Germany or Spain, and a similar proportion were cancelled in France and Italy.  The UK has experienced much greater growth in passenger numbers and reduction in government subsidy than Germany, France or Italy - and costs for passengers have risen faster too. The Rail Delivery Group argues that while the tax-payer picks up more of the cost in those countries, in the UK government funding goes into investment to improve the service.  While the European data provides a useful snapshot, but it is not up-to-date enough to reflect recent changes to rail services.The latest UK data we have comes from independent watchdog Transport Focus and was gathered between 15 January and 28 March 2018  - so it is much more recent, but still does not capture the changes to Northern's services, which began in May. The watchdog's National Rail Passenger Survey found overall satisfaction with train services had slightly declined in the past year, having increased from the year before.But it also revealed massive variation between different train lines, with satisfaction ranging from 69% to 95% across the country. The lowest ratings for overall satisfaction were given to some of the biggest franchises, including Southern, TfL Rail and Great Northern.Northern came 21st out of the 26 companies with an 80% overall satisfaction rate - only above:We don't know how the recent turmoil may have affected these ratings.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

But who are the three left on the shortlist...Born: North Kensington, LondonAge: 47Current residence: RomfordPosition on EU: LeaveKnown for: London Assembly member, former special advisor to David Cameron, former youth worker.Background: Mr Bailey grew up in the Ladbroke Grove area of West London, on the Bracewell Road estate. His family are of Jamaican origin.He was brought up by his mother after his father, a lorry driver, left the family - although he went on to rebuild his relationship with his father.Mr Bailey, who is married with two children, worked as a security man at Wembley and London's Trocadero Centre to help finance his way through his time at university.In 2008, Mr Bailey was branded ""future home secretary"" by society magazine Tatler and was subsequently dubbed one of five ""Tatler Tories"" whose parliamentary bids were unsuccessful in 2010. He was elected to the London Assembly in May 2016. He is currently deputy leader of the Conservative Greater London Authority Group.Mr Bailey has cited a Public Enemy Song, ""She Watch Channel Zero?!"", as influential on his decision to enter politics.In 2005, he published a document for the Centre for Policy Studies (of which he remains a research fellow), No Man's Land, in which he criticised liberalism and the state of inner-city neighbourhoods: ""The more liberal we have been, the more our communities have suffered."" He was particularly citing the Ladbroke Grove area of London.In 2006, Mr Bailey helped establish My Generation, where he worked as a youth worker for almost twenty years. The charity aimed to combat drugs, teenage pregnancy and encourage self-help before it was dissolved in 2012.Mr Bailey ran as a parliamentary candidate for Hammersmith, west London, in 2010 - a key marginal seat, but he failed to get elected.He was one of Cameron's 100-strong ""A list"" candidates for the then leader's ""changing faces of the Conservative Party"" campaign. Only 38 of these ended up getting elected in 2010.He's said of David Cameron: ""He's very sharp, and for someone from Eton he has a real understanding.""Mr Bailey also stood in Lewisham West and Penge in the 2017 election, coming second.Following the 2010 general election, he served as a special adviser for David Cameron between 2010 and 2013.He was appointed as the ambassador for David Cameron's big society agenda in 2011, before he was made a special advisor on youth, crime and welfare issues. He also went on to serve in advisory roles in the Cabinet Office and the Department for Education.Mr Bailey has said poor communities ""need a bit more right-wing politics"". He has spoken of his hatred of what he claims is an oversized welfare state in Britain, blaming this ""liberalism"", for the dependency culture he says it has produced among the British black population.Mr Bailey told the Telegraph in 2008 part of his value to the Conservatives is as a ""social translator"", explaining to the middle classes how people on estates think. 2020 Mayoral Pledge: ""My family first came to London in the fifties as part of the Windrush generation. They came to work hard and contribute to the country. I want to continue that tradition by making London an even better place to work, and a better place for your family.""Sadiq Khan is a mayor who has constantly broken his promises to Londoners. He is far more interested in promoting his image and pursuing PR opportunities than he is in showing leadership on tackling knife crime or building the homes London needs. Londoners deserve better.""Born: United StatesAge: 37Current residence: EalingPosition on the EU: LeaveKnown for: Ealing and Acton councillorBackground: Ms Morrissey was born in Indiana, in the United States. Her father is a church leader from Ohio, earning her the media nickname ""the other vicar's daughter"" (alongside Theresa May). She has been a British citizen for around ten years, having originally come to the capital to study for her Masters in European Social Policy at the London School of Economics. She's married with one daughter.Ms Morrissey joined the Conservative Party in 2008 and was elected to Ealing Council in 2014. She worked as an actress under the name Joy Boden before entering politics, starring in films such as Geek Mythology (2008), and Only One Can Play (2009).She told Ealing Today: ""After deciding not to go back to work in the film industry after having a child I actually looked at going back to get my PhD in international development but got involved with the local Ealing Conservatives. One thing has led to the other and here we are."" As a councillor, she is the current Conservative policy forum champion for social housing tenants. Since 2016 she has also worked for the Centre for Social Justice.Ms Morrissey was a Conservative parliamentary candidate in the 2017 general election for the Ealing Central and Acton constituency, which at the time was an ultra-marginal seat - Labour had slipped through in the 2015 election with a 274 vote majority.The councillor threatened legal action against the constituency's sitting Labour MP Rupa Huq, and pulled out of hustings for what she described as lies in Labour campaign leaflets (in particular, claims she supported the closure of Ealing Hospital and that she was a ""Hard Brexit Activist""). Ms Huq went on to hold the seat, with a vote increase of about 12%.Ms Morrissey has made the case for ""compassionate"" Conservatism that places social action and initiatives for disadvantaged communities at the heart of policy. She advocates locally-driven initiatives as opposed to state-led intervention.Ms Morrissey also believes Conservative policy on the housing crisis should focus on market-based solutions, and believes cutting ""suffocating red tape"" will give police officers better scope for tackling crime.2020 Mayoral pledge: Ms Morrissey says her campaign will focus around three main issues; tackling London's crime rate, social justice and affordable housing.She told Conservative Home: ""Like a lot of Londoners, I wasn't born here. I moved here as an immigrant and I fell in love with this vibrant city which is now my home and the place I'm raising my family.""I have shared the journey of frustration that many Londoners experience when it comes to trying to get on the housing ladder.

2018-07-30,Brexit dilemma,https://web.archive.org//web/20180731071826/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44468158,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government has tried hard to reassure EU citizens living in the UK - and Britons abroad - that they will be protected from deportation after Brexit. But many people do not fit neatly into either category, throwing up complex and unexpected dilemmas for both the Home Office and the individuals concerned.Some, such as Ursula Crosby, who contacted the BBC with her story, have been unable to get a clear answer about how to secure residency rights, and citizenship, when Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Ms Crosby retired to Portugal five years ago after 40 years of working as a physiotherapist in NHS hospitals, in London and Shrewsbury. She says she felt like spreading her wings and ""doing something a bit different"" while she could.She is a German citizen but under free movement rules she had the security of knowing she could return to the UK, where her daughter lives and where she still owns property, when she wanted to.Brexit has changed that. The UK has told EU citizens they will be able to apply for ""settled status"" if they have been living in the UK for five years or have been granted indefinite leave to remain. It is unclear how this will apply to Ms Crosby, who was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 1979. Indefinite leave to remain - despite the name - usually expires if you have left the country for two years or more, as is the case with Ms Crosby. She has received conflicting advice from UK officials about whether she would qualify for settled status and no-one has been able to tell her what will happen if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. For all the government's assurances about how easy it will be for EU citizens after Brexit, getting a straight answer on all but the most straightforward of cases is very difficult, if the experience of researching this article is anything to go by.At one point, Ms Crosby was referred to an independent immigration adviser, who told her she would be all right because Britain would probably stay in the European Economic Area after Brexit - which would be news to Prime Minister Theresa May, who has repeatedly ruled that out.She is now torn between selling up and moving back to the UK before Britain leaves the EU in March, or risking moving back at a later date, during the 21-month transition period that will follow Brexit, in the hope that she can still secure settled status.""I am sure I could live in Germany but I wouldn't really want to live in Germany,"" says the 68-year-old. ""I no longer have any connections there, as such. My parents are dead. I have a cousin in Germany. ""I could stay in Portugal but I am not sure I would want to. It was never my intention to and I still have property in England.""If I ask anybody who meets me, they all think I am British.""She first came to the UK in 1971, on a work permit, long before EU free movement rules came into force, and was married to a British man for many years.She now regrets not applying for British citizenship when she had the chance but, like many others, she did not think she needed to.""There are probably quite a lot of people in this situation,"" says immigration lawyer Colin Yeo, ""people that used to live in the UK, perhaps for a very long time, who were assuming they would be able to come back to the UK because it is a member of the EU.""They will probably be all right if they come back during the transition period.""But, he adds, many will feel ""they have got to come back now or they will lose the chance"". Ms Crosby says she can't understand why, as someone in receipt of a full UK state pension, as well as an NHS pension, she may have to wait five years after returning to the UK to qualify for British citizenship, the same as someone from an EU country who has never lived there.""I am an honest person, I have no convictions, I paid my taxes and if I go back I will be able to support myself. Am I doing any harm?"" she says.The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases, but a spokeswoman said: ""After we leave the EU, in March 2019, there will be an implementation period that ends on 31 December 2020, during which EU citizens and their family members will be free to live, work and study in the UK as they do now. ""EU citizens and their family members who become resident in the UK during the implementation period will be able to make an application to the EU Settlement Scheme and be eligible for temporary leave to remain and, after five years' lawful residence, settled status, under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement. ""The rights of those EU citizens arriving during the implementation period will be safeguarded on the same terms as has been agreed for those EU citizens resident in the UK before we leave the EU.""Ms Crosby remains unconvinced by the Home Office's reassurances - and she has written to the department to try to get some clear guidance on what she should do next.""I am not sure I can rely on the immigration system to relax their very inflexible rules,"" she says.""My worst fear is that I sell up here, move back to England and then find out that it would not have been necessary."""
2018-07-30,Pollwatch: The Chequers effect,https://web.archive.org//web/20180731071826/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44937732,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs are leaving Westminster for the summer recess. What's happened in the opinion polls and what can they tell us about what could happen when Parliament returns in the autumn?Please enable Javascript to view our poll tracker.In the first six months of 2018 the Westminster voting intention opinion polls were rather dull. But since the cabinet awayday at Chequers on 6 July, and the publication of the government's Brexit white paper the following week, there has been a marked change.For months the polls only moved very gradually. Between January and the beginning of July support for Labour dipped a couple of percentage points whilst the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats went up by about one per cent each.That did mean the Tories were fairly reliably in the lead, but only narrowly. Then came Chequers - and the calm of the first half of the year came to an abrupt end.The Conservatives have seen their rating fall back. In a couple of polls they've been at 36%, their lowest level since last year's general election.As a result, Labour has moved ahead in a sequence of polls for the first time since February.The other beneficiaries of the Conservative drop are UKIP. Until Chequers they'd not topped 5% this year. They've been above that in each of the last five published polls.None of this should be exaggerated. The movements aren't massive. But after months where changes happened at a snail's pace, it's a striking development.It could yet turn out that this is just a blip. The absence of warring Conservative MPs from Westminster might see the public's view of the party improve. But if it is a blip, it's a pretty big one.And it potentially foreshadows further turbulence in the autumn when Theresa May and the EU hope to finalise a Brexit deal.To see how difficult the prime minister's task is on Brexit just look at polls about it.Voters remain pretty evenly split about whether it was a good decision.We've seen a continuation of the trend from 2017. Over time, the number of people who say that Brexit was the wrong decision has very gradually increased, but there's no sign of a consensus forming.Worse still for the prime minister, polls which seek to capture what people think should happen next suggest an even more divided public.An interesting poll by new polling firm Deltapoll asked precisely that question: According to this poll, there's no course of action which has the support of even a third of voters. That could cause problems for Theresa May. It's going to be very hard for her to please a majority of the public whatever she does."
2018-07-30,FOI failings,https://web.archive.org//web/20180731071826/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44864770,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMajor government departments are continuing to demonstrate persistent delays and unhelpfulness in their responses to information requests, according to research conducted by the BBC. Last June we reported on how the Home Office, Ministry of Justice and Cabinet Office were frequently criticised by the Information Commissioner for their inadequate handling of FOI applications. Our analysis of decisions issued since then by the commissioner shows that the poor performance of these three departments has continued.The Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is being criticised by openness campaigners for not taking stronger action over the repeated failings. The Home Office has a particularly extreme record and has been rebuked by the Information Commissioner's Office in several dozen cases over the past 12 months.The ICO describes delays faced by requesters to the Home Office in various cases as ""unacceptable"", ""extremely lengthy"", ""particularly severe"" and ""inexplicable and unjustifiable"".In some instances the Home Office took several months to reach a decision and reply. In numerous other cases it failed to respond at all. The commissioner also reprimanded the Home Office over responses which were ""unhelpful"", showed ""poor handling"", ""did not provide any explanation"" or which contained a ""lack of detail"", ""no reasoning"", an ""extremely disappointing rationale"", or information which was ""not accurate"".Numerous ICO decision notices contain statements along the lines that the commissioner has made a record of the problem and that ""this issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases suggest that this is necessary"" or ""this may form evidence in future enforcement action against the HO should evidence from other cases suggest that there are systemic issues within the HO that are causing delays"".Since this is often repeated in the ICO decisions, it is not clear what further evidence of ""systemic issues"" ought to be required. The Ministry of Justice has also been frequently rebuked by the Commissioner for its failures to comply with the FOI law. The ICO criticises the ministry over delays which were ""very considerable"", ""far in excess of the requirement"", ""extremely lengthy"" and ""grossly excessive and entirely unacceptable"".As with the Home Office, there are numerous cases where the Ministry of Justice failed to send any response before the ICO's formal decision was issued. Similarly, many decision notices repeat the familiar statement that the failing has been noted and the issue may be revisited should evidence from other cases indicate there are systemic issues A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""We received nearly 5,000 FOI requests last year, one of the highest figures across Whitehall. We surpassed the ICO's high target for response times last year and have improved even further since - responding to 93% of requests on time in the latest figures.""The Cabinet Office also comes in for continuing criticism over its poor record on FOI.  This includes delays which were ""clearly against the spirit and intention of FOIA"", ""excessive"" and ""unacceptable"".It is also reprimanded for ""poorly conceived submissions"", lack of ""meaningful detail"", being ""illogical"", ""erroneous"", ""unsustainable"", providing ""generic"" arguments, handling which ""clearly fell short"", and having ""wrongly interpreted"" correspondence from a requester.This is despite the fact that the Cabinet Office is responsible for government FOI policy and should therefore set an example to other public authorities.Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information said that Elizabeth Denham should take stronger action: ""Departments have discovered that they can repeatedly ignore the regulator - and nothing happens. The solution is in the commissioner's hands. She should promptly serve chronic offenders with enforcement notices and threaten court action if they fail to comply.""She should also report the problem to Parliament and encourage a select committee to ask ministers in front of the TV cameras why they are treating the public's right to know with contempt.""An ICO spokesperson said: ""The ICO can take monitoring action if a public authority's performance needs to improve. Whether or not disclosure applies to a request is not always straightforward. That is why we work with departments to improve processes so decisions on what information can be released under FOI can be made more effectively and efficiently.""Requests to these departments which have been badly affected by delays include some submitted by myself and by BBC colleagues. The government departments involved have been approached for comment.Research by Patrick Cowling"
2018-07-30,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180731071826/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues and on future relations - after agreement was reached on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree within six months on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May was now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-30,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180731071826/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Read more from LauraJohn Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of StrathclydeThis is the third post-war snap election called unexpectedly before a party's term of office had come to an end.  On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.

""I apologise for the concerns and anxiety that this has caused.""By BBC political correspondent Ben WrightProminent Jewish voices inside and outside Labour are furious that the leadership seems to claim a clearer idea about what constitutes anti-Semitism than they do.Neither the actions nor words of Jeremy Corbyn have managed to calm this argument down.And while the government struggles to keep its plan for Brexit on the road, Labour appears to be stuck in a cul-de-sac of blame and recrimination on how it's tackling anti-Semitism.Read more from Ben WrightIn July, Labour faced criticism over its new code of conduct on anti-Semitism, which critics claimed did not sign up fully to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition.Labour says it has included the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition but has rewritten four of the examples included to expand and contextualise them ""to produce legally robust guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases"".Following the row the party's MPs will vote in September on whether to adopt the full IHRA wording after passing an emergency motion last week.Louise Ellman said she was ""exceedingly disturbed"" by the situation, adding that by diluting the definition of anti-Semitism - a charge which the Labour leadership rejects - Labour had ""made it possible to compare Israel with the Nazis"".She added: ""Jeremy is our leader, we want to be the next government, we need to change the way that this country is run to address the injustices in our society.""But we can't do that while we are engulfed in this crisis of the Labour Party's inability to deal with anti-Semitism in its own ranks.""Labour MP John Mann, a long-standing critic of Mr Corbyn, told BBC Radio 4 Today that hosting an event called ""Auschwitz to Gaza"" on Holocaust Memorial Day breached anti-Semitism rules and ""breaches any form of normal decency"".""I've no idea how he got himself into that situation, but I'm glad that he has apologised and on the back of that apology is the opportunity to do something significant,"" he said.Ann Black, a member of Labour's National Executive Committee and a supporter of Mr Corbyn, urged him to follow the advice of shadow cabinet colleagues and adopt the working definition on anti-Semitism.She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if necessary the party could add assurances that members were free to defend Palestinians or criticise the Israeli government.""I don't think Jeremy Corbyn is in any way racist or anti-Semitic. I do believe he has the authority and the ability to break the current impasse,"" she said."

An assessment by Dover Council said a giant 13-mile ""lorry park"", proposed for the M20, could be in place for years as ports try to cope with the situation. It said ""there does not appear to be a Plan B"" if it does not work, and it could lead to ""17-mile traffic jams"". Kent County Council has also warned that any increased border and customs checks could lead to delays and long queues of port freight traffic.Mr Hunt, who is holding talks with his French and Austrian opposite numbers, warned of economic consequences for both the UK and the EU if a deal can't be found. ""The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink. ""That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation,"" he said.""There is a real chance of no deal by accident.""Mr Hunt's talks in France came on the back of a visit to China where he made headlines for a different reason - getting his wife's nationality wrong.On Monday, the foreign secretary mistakenly told his hosts his Chinese wife was Japanese before correcting himself and admitting he had made a ""terrible mistake"".He has since tweeted his apologies to his ""long-suffering"" wife - and he used his trip to France to make amends, choosing her some flowers in Paris:In Paris choosing some flowers to bring back to Mrs H pic.twitter.com/iGzWyj0oOAEnd of Twitter post  by @Jeremy_Hunt"
2018-07-31,High Court 'misled' over child refugees,https://web.archive.org//web/20180801061320/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45021520,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government ""misled"" the High Court over its decision to refuse unaccompanied child refugees in Calais the right to join their families in the UK, says the Court of Appeal. The ruling revealed Home Office lawyers gave advice on how to avoid legal challenges by not giving children reasons for their refusal.As a result, over 500 children were rejected and ""many"" are now missing.The Home Office said it had ""noted the criticisms"" and were reviewing them. Yvette Cooper MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, described the Home Office's actions as a ""shocking denial of children's rights"".The demolition of the ""Jungle"" refugee camp in Calais was ordered in October 2016, when Amber Rudd was Home Secretary. As a result of the closure, the government conducted over 1,000 interviews with unaccompanied children who claimed to have family in the UK. Around 550 were brought to the country - but over 500 were rejected. Many of them then went missing from the French centres they were living in.The court ruling said the Home Office's process for refusing to transfer the children was ""unfair and unlawful"".It said failures in the system were prejudicial to the children, who had no realistic prospect of challenging the rejections.Lord Justice Singh added that not presenting the evidence - namely emails showing the lawyer's advice - to the High Court hearing was ""a serious breach of the duty of candour and co-operation"". Charity Safe Passage - part of the community organising group Citizens UK - first took the case to the High Court in September to challenge the Home Office and the way it dealt with the unaccompanied child refugees. The court ruled in favour of the government, saying it had acted lawfully in not providing full reasons.It said, despite ""serious shortcomings"" in the processes of assessing the applications, the department was ""justified"" due to the time frame and urgent conditions the UK was working under after the clearance of the camp was announced.   But on Tuesday, the Court of Appeal overturned High Court's decision, saying the judge had been given an ""incomplete picture"" by the government and a ""great deal of important evidence"" was not brought to the court's attention. The evidence came in the form of emails between the UK Border Force and the French authorities - disclosed in another case being mounted by Citizens UK - detailing the lawyer's advice to not provide reasons for refusal to avoid legal challenges. The emails also showed that French officials wanted the children to be given an adequate explanation - despite the government previously presenting evidence that the authorities only required ""sparse"" detail.Lord Justice Singh said: ""In my judgment, the process which was adopted by the secretary of state in the present context failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness as a matter of common law.""Ms Cooper said : ""Everyone knows the Home Office gets decisions wrong, but these teenagers and children weren't even told the reasons why, so they or their families could challenge basic mistakes.""The result was many of those teenagers and children disappeared again - very possibly straight back into the arms of smugglers, traffickers and abusers.""Sonal Ghelani of the Islington Law Centre, which worked on the appeal, said it was ""extremely disturbing"" for the Home Office to act in the way it did. Calling for an investigation into the Home Office's actions, she added: ""Public authorities have a duty of candour to provide the court with a full and accurate explanation of all the facts but we now know there was a serious breach of the duty of candour in this case.""Beth Gardiner-Smith, project lead for Safe Passage, added: ""Tragically, many of the children that were refused by the government with no good reason have since gone missing from French authorities' care, and we have little to no information on their whereabouts or wellbeing.""Today's judgment reveals not only the failure of the Home Office to comply with law but also its abysmal disregard for the safety and welfare of incredibly vulnerable children.""A Home Office spokesperson said the UK had worked with France to expedite the transfer of vulnerable unaccompanied children from Calais in October 2016 in response to an ""urgent humanitarian situation"" and their priority was to ""provide safe passage for children"". The spokesperson added: ""The court agreed that the process operated by the government was outside of its existing obligations under EU law. ""However, we note the criticisms contained within the wider ruling and are currently reviewing these with our legal team.""A French Senate report from July 2017 found that 709 children removed during the clearances of the camps in Calais had subsequently gone missing from French care shelters.

2018-07-31,Labour pressure over Corbyn ally's remarks,https://web.archive.org//web/20180801061320/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45014771,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour is facing growing calls to take action against an ally of Jeremy Corbyn after he was recorded criticising members of the Jewish community.During a meeting of the ruling National Executive Committee, Peter Willsman suggested Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks.Mr Willsman also said he had never seen anti-Semitism in the party.He has apologised and said not all his remarks were accurately reported.He also said he would be referring himself for equalities training. But Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews said he should be ""summarily expelled"", and the Jewish Labour Movement called for his suspension and a disciplinary investigation.Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson accused Mr Willsman of being a ""loud-mouthed bully"" and high-profile supporters of Mr Corbyn have also taken to Twitter to urge Mr Willsman to withdraw from the elections to the NEC.He was supported by Labour MP and former frontbencher Chris Williamson who endorsed him for the ruling body vote.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the row had added significance because Mr Willsman had been a ""fellow traveller politically"" of the Labour leader over the years and was a leading ""Corbynite"".The recording, published by the Jewish Chronicle, was made at an NEC meeting earlier this month which took place after more than 60 British rabbis signed an open letter that said anti-Semitism in sections of the Labour Party was ""severe and widespread"".This followed criticism of the party's new code of conduct on anti-Semitism, which  critics claimed did not sign up fully to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's working definition.For the avoidance of doubt: Peter Willsman is and always has been a loud mouthed bully. He disgusts me.  https://t.co/FwyMZYsaMqEnd of Twitter post  by @tom_watsonIn the recording, Mr Willsman can be heard discussing the rabbis' open letter with other NEC members.Mr Willsman says he does not want to be ""lectured to by Trump fanatics"", and argues the NEC should ask the rabbis for ""evidence of severe and widespread anti-Semitism"" in the party.He then asks those at the meeting to raise their hands if they had witnessed anti-Semitism in the Labour party - and said he was ""amazed"" when some said they had.Labour said it was ""committed to tackling and eradicating anti-Semitism in all its forms, in our party and our society"".Asked about Mr Willsman's remarks, it said: ""We don't comment on individual cases.""The Jewish Labour Movement also accused the party of ""double standards"" over its decision to pursue disciplinary action against MPs Margaret Hodge and Ian Austin - both critics of Mr Corbyn and the new code of conduct.A Labour source said Mr Willsman's case had been treated ""like any other"", saying he had apologised and that meant the matter had been resolved.Following the publication of the recording, the NEC member said he had supported ""the decision to confirm the adoption of the code of conduct on anti-Semitism and to reopen development of the code in consultation with Jewish community organisations"". He added: ""Not all of what I said has been accurately reported. But I accept that what I did say, and the way I said it, fell short of the requirement, which I accept, for discussions of contentious issues to be conducted in a fully civil and respectful way.""He said he ""deeply"" apologised for any offence caused. Mr Willsman apologised again when speaking at the meeting of Labour's NEC, saying: ""I recognise the offensive nature of my comments.""  After his comments, there's no way I'll vote for Pete Willsman for Labour's NEC.I'll proudly vote for the other 8 excellent Labour left candidates.

2018-07-31,Charities 'almost complicit' in sex scandal,https://web.archive.org//web/20180801061320/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45013078,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe aid sector is guilty of ""complacency verging on complicity"" over an ""endemic"" sex abuse scandal, a damning report from MPs has said.Stephen Twigg, chairman of the international development committee, said charities were ""more concerned to protect their own reputation"".The committee's inquiry was launched in light of revelations that senior Oxfam staff paid survivors of the 2010 Haiti earthquake for sex.Charities welcomed the MPs' report. Oxfam Trustees chairwoman Caroline Thomson said the committee had been right to challenge the charity sector and recognised ""we have further to go"". The Oxfam scandal, revealed in February in The Times, led to further allegations about UK-based charities. The report, which looked at allegations dating back to 2001, says the delivery of aid to people had been subverted by sexual predators. The committee said in their report: ""Having understood the length of time that the sector has been aware of these issues, we reflect with confusion on the apparent shock of those we spoke to in the immediate aftermath of the Times report. This has been a known problem in the international aid sector for years."" ""So much more"" could have been done to tackle the ""open secret"" of people working in the aid sector committing such acts, the MPs added. Despite the charities knowing about the problem, the committee said there had been a ""collective failure of leadership"", with action only when there was a crisis.The report also said leaders were ""self-deluded"" in thinking they had addressed problems before they became public.MPs insisted more resources were needed to tackle the issue - and said victims had to be at the ""heart of solutions"", or the response could be ""harmful"".Mr Twigg suggested something akin to DBS checks, the criminal records check system used in the UK, could be adopted internationally, to provide details of past allegations to prospective employers. ""That won't cure this but it's one of the ways in which we can try to ensure this won't happen again,"" he said. The MPs also recommended an independent aid ombudsman should be introduced and have called for a global register of aid workers, who will operate according to expected standards. The committee also suggested:The report looked at allegations of sex abuse and child abuse by aid workers, dating back to 2001. They found sexual assault and exploitation was ""predominately perpetrated against women and girls"" and mainly carried out by men. A 2008 Save the Children report into the under-reporting of child sexual exploitation and abuse, seen by the MPs, said the abusers were ""both foreign and national staff"", with the majority being ""local people employed by international humanitarian organisations"". A 2002 UNHCR and Save the Children report, which looked at refugee camps in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, found that humanitarian workers extorted ""sex in exchange for desperately needed aid supplies (biscuits, soap, medicines, plastic sheeting etc)"". The victims were mainly girls aged 13 to 18, who reported consequences including ""pregnancies, abortions, teenage motherhood, [and] exposure to sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS"". The committee found that a recurring theme was ""abuse of power"". ""No corner of the aid sector appears to be immune,"" their report said. ""The problem is a collective one."" Oxfam trustees chairwoman Caroline Thomson said the report made for ""painful reading"" for the whole aid sector, and apologised that Oxfam had failed to protect vulnerable women in Haiti.She said the charity had tripled funding for safeguarding, established an independent whistleblowing phone line and agreed to publish the details of safeguarding cases twice a year.Save the Children UK said it was strengthening its internal safeguarding systems and had called for greater government oversight.Chief executive Kevin Watkins said: ""We have made mistakes in our own handling of historical sexual harassment complaints from staff in the UK,"" adding, ""there is a great deal more to do"".International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt welcomed the report, saying: ""Until the sector is fully prepared to address the power imbalance, cultures, and behaviours that allow sexual abuse, exploitation and harassment to happen, we will never stamp it out.""An international summit on the issue is due to take place in October, and Ms Mordaunt has called for the sector to demonstrate the progress they have made by then. In February the Times reported Oxfam male aid workers used prostitutes during a humanitarian mission after the Haiti earthquake in 2010. More allegations then followed, against Oxfam and other UK charities. Oxfam has since revealed it has to make £16m of cuts because of reduced funding following the scandal, with thousands stopping their regular donations. Its chief executive Mark Goldring stood down in May. His deputy Penny Lawrence had quit in February.In a separate story relating to alleged misconduct in the charity sector, Brendan Cox, the husband of murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, had to quit his role at the two charities set up in her memory. He denied assaulting a woman in her 30s at Harvard University in 2015 but admitted ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. And former Ex-Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth faced three complaints of inappropriate behaviour against female staff. He said he had ""apologised unreservedly"" to the workers at the time. He resigned from his post at Unicef, saying he did not want coverage of his past to ""damage"" the charities. "

Flags at the parliament have been lowered to half mast as a mark of respect.Born in Wigtownshire in 1949, Sir Alex was educated at Eton College and the Scottish Agricultural College before running his family farm for almost 30 years.He reared cattle and sheep on the 1,500 acre farm in South Ayrshire until being elected to the Scottish Parliament as a political newcomer in 1999, as a regional list member for South Scotland.He was then returned as a constituency MSP in Galloway in the next three elections, and was picked as presiding officer by fellow members for the 2007 to 2011 term - defeating Margo MacDonald by a margin of 103 to 20.He said he had no intention of becoming presiding officer, having been ""just relieved to be returned to parliament"" after defending a majority of 99 votes against a ""strong SNP challenge"" in the 2007 election.Sir Alex said he ""immensely enjoyed the privilege"" of holding the post, but said it left little time for family life and constituency issues.After the 2011 election he was pitched straight back onto the front line for the Conservatives, becoming the party's rural affairs spokesman one day after stepping down as the parliament's figurehead.He was immediately entitled to a pension for serving as presiding officer, but opted to donate it to charities in his constituency while he was still receiving an MSP's salary.Sir Alex stepped down as an MSP at the 2016 election, after 17 years of public service. He said he had ""tried very hard"" to represent his constituents, saying ""I cannot thank them enough for that privilege"".He was subsequently knighted in the Queen's birthday honours for services to public life in Scotland, something he described as an ""extraordinary honour"".His Galloway and West Dumfries seat was held by the Conservatives, with Finlay Carson succeeding him.Ms Davidson said Sir Alex was ""an enormous figure"" in the Scottish Conservative party.She said: ""He was a great defender of parliament, as you saw through his exemplary period of office as presiding officer.""But his first love was south west Scotland, and even after he left Holyrood he still campaigned to get a new national park in his beloved Dumfries and Galloway.""Current presiding officer, Ken Macintosh, said Sir Alex had ""a deep-seated sense of duty and service"".He added: ""At Holyrood and in life beyond politics, there are few people who had the pleasure of knowing Alex who did not like him immensely. He is the first presiding officer to leave us, and he will be missed terribly by members and staff alike.""I am very sorry to hear of Alex Fergusson’s passing. He was a distinguished Presiding Officer of @ScotParl and a dedicated parliamentarian with friends and admirers from across the political spectrum. My thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues. https://t.co/0RzmWal56WEnd of Twitter post  by @NicolaSturgeonFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Sir Alex was a ""distinguished presiding officer and a dedicated parliamentarian with friends and admirers from across the political spectrum"".Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: ""To me, Alex was foremost a great friend and I will miss him dearly.""He is the most thoroughly decent person I have ever known. He was the absolute opposite of the career politician and was guided by a sense of public duty and his core values of family, community and country, rather than party dogma.""Scottish Labour's South Scotland MSP Colin Smyth said the former presiding officer was ""a real giant of a man in every way"", adding: ""He treated everyone, friend or political foe, with decency and good humour and was a real gentleman respected by everyone across the political divide.""Scottish Green co-convener said Sir Alex was ""always a decent person"", while Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said he had ""guided the parliament through uncharted territory with great skill"" during Holyrood's first period of minority government."

The Dover council report stated: ""A 13-mile stretch of the coast-bound section of the M20, between junction eight near Maidstone and junction nine near Ashford, will be earmarked to hold heavy goods vehicles, in what will effectively become a giant temporary lorry park holding around 2,000 lorries.""It is likely a permanent solution will not be in place for many years if enacted through current planning processes and procedures.""The report, released under a Freedom of Information request, said ""there could be gridlock around the town"" if Brexit ""ends up creating regulatory and tariff barriers between the UK and the EU"".""Customs checks on imports from outside the common market can take between five minutes to 45 minutes per vehicle,"" it added.""Port officials have warned that increasing the average time it takes to clear customs by as little as two minutes could lead to 17-mile traffic jams.""A government spokesman said: ""As the prime minister has set out, after Brexit we will not only seek to forge new trade relationships with partners around the world but also maintain frictionless trade in goods between the UK and EU. ""While we remain confident of reaching an agreement with the EU to achieve this, it is only sensible to prepare for a range of scenarios. ""That is why the Department for Transport is working closely with a range of partners on contingency plans to ensure freight can continue to move as freely as possible between the UK and Europe.""The spokesman also insisted that work on Operation Brock would have taken place regardless of Brexit to improve contingency arrangements for a range of scenarios which could result in cross-Channel disruption.Highways England said it recently consulted on a permanent solution and is considering responses.In the meantime, it said Operation Brock would create up to 2,000 on-road lorry holding spaces between junctions 8 and 9 on the M20. It said it would offer ""significant benefit"" compared to Operation Stack, as it would keep traffic flowing in both directions.Deployment of the temporary solution is planned for a maximum duration of up to six months, it added.Conservative MP for Dover Charlie Elphicke tweeted that the report underlined the case for investment in border infrastructure and roads.He added: ""The government has not done enough to prepare in the two years since the EU referendum.""Kent County Council set out its position on preparations for Brexit earlier this month. It warned that any increased border and customs checks could lead to delays and long queues of port freight traffic.It added: ""We need to avoid the dire consequences experienced in 2015 which impacted on the Kent economy and and more broadly on the national economy.""It said there needed to be a ""robust, workable implementation plan that utilises all available resources"" and urged the government to consider making further resources available.Additional powers in legislation should also be considered, it added, to ensure that all agencies have the necessary authority to take action to ensure the free-flow of traffic.More than 10,000 freight vehicles pass through Dover on peak days as it handles one sixth of the UK's total trade in goods with a value of £119bn per year.In 2015, queues of 4,600 lorries stretched back 30 miles and the daily cost to the UK economy was estimated at £250m."

He said he wanted the public to know about his condition after first being diagnosed three years ago.""Life goes pretty much as normal and I'm prepared for a different future,"" the former Mid Worcestershire MP said.Sir Peter, who stood down as an MP at the 2015 general election, said he has been told his symptoms are mild and that taking medicine three times a day has helped him.""I should be optimistic my specialist says,"" he said.The condition means the brain is progressively damaged leading to a tremor and difficulty moving.Sir Peter said first symptoms he noticed were the loss of his voice, excessive salivating and pains in his joints.""I remember at functions at the House of Commons and I'd make a cup of tea I couldn't move my hands to get the cup of tea down on the table after I'd finish drinking it,"" he said.He was ""extraordinarily uncomfortable"" when sitting down at times and ""the aches and pains started coming and the dribbling - which was embarrassing,"" he added.Eventually, he saw a neurologist after his wife, Julia, said he was not ""walking right"".He said it took a ""long, long time"" for a diagnosis as his physiotherapist, dentist and occupational health doctor did not recognise his symptoms.However, finding out he had the condition came as a relief because he understood what was wrong and is now urging other people who may fear they have the degenerative disease to go see their GP.He said the diagnosis was not the reason he stood down as an MP after 23 years and he is confident the disease would not affect his ability to do his job at the Heritage Lottery Fund.""I think it is better that people know,"" he said.""It's certainly made life much easier for my family... the burden of the secret has gone.""He added that although the disease presents an unknown future, as it can lead to a ""rather fast decline"", he was prepared.""I've made the preparations for it and we'll see what happens."""

Ms Clarke had been accused of submitting a form which increased her annual pay from £37,000 to £39,000, and decreasing her weekly hours from 40 to 37.5. It was alleged that she had forged Mrs Harris' signature on the form, which was submitted to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), in August 2015.A jury of eight men and four women was told the alleged offences came to light when Ms Clarke was demoted and her replacement examined staff reports detailing hours and salary.She was arrested in July 2016 and later charged with forgery and fraud.In police interview, she admitted signing Mrs Harris' name on the form and sending the email from her account but insisted both were done on the MP's instruction.Mrs Harris was elected as MP for Swansea East at the General Election in 2015, after her predecessor Sian James stepped down.Both Mrs Harris and Ms Clarke had worked for Mrs James before the election.The trial heard allegations that Mrs Harris had pulled the hair of the defendant so hard that clumps came out. She was also accused by Ms Clarke of ""outing"" the defendant, who is gay, to colleagues. Mrs Harris said the allegations were ""totally untrue"".Speaking outside the court, Ms Clarke said: ""I'm just elated it's concluded. Words cannot describe."" "
2018-07-31,MPs urge a rethink of UK devolution,https://web.archive.org//web/20180801061320/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-45004899,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government ""must rethink devolution"" as a result of Brexit, a group of MPs have recommended.The process of leaving the EU has sparked a series of clashes between UK government ministers and their counterparts in Scotland and Wales.Westminster's constitutional affairs committee said ministers should engage more and set out policies more clearly.The Scottish government has also called for a ""new arrangement"" for devolution in light of the recent Brexit rows.The UK government says it is committed to devolution and giving a voice to each part of the United Kingdom.Scottish and Welsh ministers have regularly coordinated their opposition to the UK government's approach to Brexit, with first ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones issuing joint statements and backing each other in the defence of devolved powers.Earlier in July, ministers united to complain that they had not been given a ""meaningful opportunity"" to contribute to the UK's negotiating position after ""unsatisfactory"" talks.And while the Welsh government eventually came to a deal with UK ministers over the EU Withdrawal Bill, MSPs in Scotland voted not to give their consent to the Westminster legislation - and could do so for future Brexit bills.Meanwhile, UK law officers have challenged Holyrood's own Brexit bill in the Supreme Court, with judges currently considering whether the legislation was within the devolved parliament's remit.Members of the constitutional affairs committee - including Conservative, Labour, SNP and independent MPs - said there had been ""a significant erosion of trust between the UK government and the devolved administrations"".They said that because devolution was established in the context of EU membership, Brexit has thrown up a series of new ""constitutional questions and ambiguities"" which must be addressed. They recommended ministers set out a ""devolution policy for the union"" to answer some of these questions.The committee also said it was ""highly regrettable that there was little consultation with the devolved governments over the EU Withdrawal Bill"", saying this ""could have avoided much of the acrimony that was generated"".And the MPs said there was ""considerably ambiguity"" around the Sewel convention - the principle that Westminster would ""not normally"" legislate in devolved areas without consent. They recommended that ""clear statements of circumstances under which legislative consent is not required by the convention be set out"".The committee's chairman, Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, said more attention also needed to be paid to the place of England and its various regions in the constitution.He said: ""We recommend the government sets out a clear devolution policy for the union as we leave the EU. Failure to do this just prolongs misunderstandings which are the basis for more conflict. ""The present machinery for developing inter-governmental relations is flimsy, and there is nothing to give the various parts of England a say. Ignoring this risks the future relations within the UK.""Ronnie Cowan, the SNP member on the committee, added: ""This report highlights the lack of trust, confidence and the divisions within the UK government itself - as well as a system of inter-governmental relations in the UK which is simply not fit for purpose in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.""'If the Tories had engaged with the devolved administrations after the Brexit referendum and had a grown-up conversation that allowed for input and constructive criticism, then we could be in a very different place.""A UK government spokesman said: ""We are committed to securing a deal that works for the entire United Kingdom and have been absolutely clear that when devolved powers are returned from Brussels, the vast majority will go straight to the devolved administrations.""For the past year, we have been focused on constructively engaging with the devolved administrations and continue to have regular meetings with them, held at all levels, including the Joint Ministerial Committees and Ministerial Forums.""All sides have committed to continuing to work together, including building common frameworks so that UK businesses won't face a cliff edge on the day we leave the EU.""The Scottish government has previously called for changes to the way devolution operates, saying that ""we can't carry on with devolution as it is"" in light of MPs passing the Withdrawal Bill without Holyrood's consent.Scottish Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell said the report ""demonstrates that fundamental change is required within the UK government to ensure devolution is respected"".Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the report was ""superbly clear that reform of inter-governmental relations is overdue""."
2018-07-31,Pupils unable to read is 'a scandal',https://web.archive.org//web/20180801061320/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-45009467,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt is a ""scandal"" that some children start school unable to speak in full sentences, Education Secretary Damian Hinds has said in a speech.And if children reach Year 1 unable to read simple words, they rarely catch up, ""the gap just widens"", he said. He has pledged to halve the number of pupils starting school behind in early talking and reading skills by 2028.A group of companies and charities have been brought together to work out how best to support families in England.Educational researchers have long said that social mobility - or the lack of it - starts at home with what's known as the home learning environment.The idea is that a home with a lot of books and other early learning materials, plus engaged parents giving their children quality time, talking with them and teaching them how to make letter sounds, for example, provides a good start.But not all parents feel able to offer this kind of home environment or realise the importance of it.Researchers from the Education Policy Institute last week said the development gap between England's poorest pupils, and the others, was already at 4.3 months in the early years. And that it grew to 9.4 months by the end of primary school.Mr Hinds said, in the speech in London, that this early gap had a ""huge impact on social mobility"".""The truth is the vast majority of these children's time is at home.""Yes the home learning environment can be, understandably, the last taboo in education policy - but we can't afford to ignore it when it comes social mobility.""I don't have interest in lecturing parents here... I know it's parents who bring up their children, who love them. who invest in them in so many ways, who want the best for their children.""But that doesn't mean extra support and advice can't be helpful.""The Department for Education says 28% of children in England do not have the required language skills by the end of Reception.But this rises to much higher percentages in deprived areas.Mr Hinds also says he is particularly keen to use technology to build awareness of what parents can do to boost early language development.The speech comes a few months after communication charities, and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, published their own report on the lack of progress on improving speech and language services over the past decade.It was based on responses to a major independent cross-government review of such services chaired by John Bercow, which was published 10 years ago.Bercow 10 Years On said that communication was crucial to children's life chances but awareness of its importance among the public and decision-makers was not sufficient.Services were inaccessible and inequitable, it said, and too often support for children's speech, language and communication needs was based on the available resources, rather than what was needed, leading to great variations across the country.It also said some measures shown to have worked well had been cut to save money.The government is yet to respond to that report.Bob Reitemeier,  chief executive of I Can, the children's communication charity,  welcomed the plans but said the coalition of companies and charities must include experts with experience of supporting children with speech, language and communication needs.""Research shows that in some areas of deprivation 50% of children are starting school well behind their peers in language development.  ""Without support, the gap between these children and other children will continue to widen, year on year, putting their life chances at risk."""

The EHIC entitles you to state-provided medical treatment should you need it while visiting one of those countries. The UK has issued 27 million EHIC cards . They cover pre-existing medical conditions as well as emergency care if you have an accident or become ill on holiday. Individuals with chronic illnesses, for example those who require daily dialysis, can travel to the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, knowing they would receive the necessary treatment on the same terms as the citizens of the country they are visiting. With Brexit currently expected on 29 March 2019, what is likely to happen to EHIC provision after that date?The UK and the EU have reached agreement in principle that there should be a transition period between 29 March 2019 and 31 December 2020 to allow more time for negotiations on the future UK-EU relationship. During the transition, or implementation period as the UK government prefers to call it, all EU law will continue to apply in the UK. That would mean that citizens would have exactly the same rights and guarantees as before - so, you'll still be able to use your card.But the transition period will only come into effect if the withdrawal agreement is ratified by both the EU and the UK before Brexit day and there are still some significant challenges to overcome, such as the Irish border issue.What happens after the transition period in 2021 and beyond is not clear, as this will be decided as part of the negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship. In the Brexit White Paper published on 12 July  2018, the UK government said it wanted ""UK and EU nationals to continue to be able to use the EHIC to receive health care should they need it while on holiday"".A House of Lords report in March 2018 warned that ""in the absence of an agreement on future relations that covers this topic, the rights currently enjoyed by 27 million UK citizens, thanks to the EHIC, will cease after Brexit"".If the UK left with no deal at all, then there could be attempts to put some kind of emergency measures in place for UK citizens or to agree reciprocal deals with individual EU countries but it is impossible to say at this point what the outcome might be. A spokesman told BBC News the government was increasingly confident it would secure a deal with the EU but was also planning ""for the unlikely scenario in which it is not possible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement and the UK exits the EU without a deal"".""We are working to build our understanding of the systems, processes and infrastructure needed in member states to ensure that the safety of both UK and EU patients is protected in all scenarios."" The UK has reciprocal health insurance deals with a few non-EU countries, including Australia and New Zealand, under which visitors can receive free urgent treatment. These will be unaffected by Brexit negotiations. There are about one million UK citizens who already live abroad in the European Union. What will happen to their access to healthcare in those EU countries after Brexit?They are currently eligible for the same healthcare as citizens of the EU country they live in and they can use their EHIC when they travel to another EU country as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein, for emergency healthcare.So far, the EU and the UK have provisionally agreed that these people would be able to retain their rights, both on healthcare and the EHIC. The same would apply for EU citizens in the UK.But, this will only come into effect only if the withdrawal agreement is ratified by both the EU and the UK before Brexit day.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-07-31,Hunt's wife gaffe,https://web.archive.org//web/20180801061320/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45004765,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK's new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is on an official visit to China - but an embarrassing gaffe is stealing the headlines instead.Mr Hunt tried to get into his host's good books by mentioning that his wife is Chinese - but called her ""Japanese"" instead.He quickly corrected himself and those at the meeting laughed it off.But the gaffe is making headlines and, as Mr Hunt himself says, it's a ""terrible mistake to make"".Lucia Guo was born in Xian in central China. She and Mr Hunt met in 2008, when she was working at Warwick University. They have three children.Mr Hunt was at a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, when he said, in English: ""My wife is Japanese - my wife is Chinese. Sorry, that's a terrible mistake to make.""He explained that he and Mr Wang ""spoke in Japanese at the state banquet"", before going on to say: ""My wife is Chinese and my children are half-Chinese and so we have Chinese grandparents who live in Xian and strong family connections in China.""So why was this such a gaffe?Confusing China with any other country is bad if you're trying to curry favour with the Chinese government. But of all the countries to get confused with, Japan is probably the worst one. That's because the two countries have had a particularly bitter relationship for decades. They fought each other in two Sino-Japanese wars, and are also in a dispute over territory in the East China Sea.Among China's older generation, there are plenty of people who are reluctant to buy Japanese products or go to Japan on holiday - because they accuse Japan of playing down its wartime atrocities.And there were several anti-Japanese protests across China in 2012, when tensions over the disputed islands flared up. It's easy for anyone to make a slip of the tongue, or get confused about someone's ethnicity.Mr Hunt speaks Japanese and worked in Japan - and says he spoke with Mr Wang in Japanese - which might explain why it was on his mind at the meeting.But even then, it's awkward explaining why ""Japanese"" slipped out at a conference with Chinese officials - especially since he was talking about his own wife.Rule #1 as a new Foreign Sec: when reflecting in English with the Chinese on a conversation you had with them in Japanese about your Chinese wife, don’t get any of those mixed up! Apologies to the long-suffering Mrs H...!End of Twitter post  by @Jeremy_HuntSpeaking of which...There's a common joke that East Asians ""all look the same"" - and many East Asians have complained that people make lazy assumptions about what ethnicity they are.For example, I've had people yell ""Konnichiwa"" (a Japanese greeting) at me even though I'm ethnic Chinese, while my British Japanese friend has faced several ""Ni Haos"" (hello in Chinese) from strangers. Most East Asians I know would agree that it's not the worst mistake someone could make - but it's still pretty annoying.Mr Hunt's gaffe may have been an innocent slip of the tongue - but it's a pretty unfortunate mistake to have made in this context.And, more importantly for Mr Hunt - it's not going to impress his hosts, which was the whole point of him mentioning his wife in the first place.Given China's rising status as a world power, and the clout of its consumers, lots of politicians and businesses have been trying to endear themselves to the Chinese. But it's easier said than done. Both Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and French President Emmanuel Macron have tried to impress Chinese audiences by speaking Mandarin - to mixed reviews.And having Chinese family ties doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing with China either.For example, Gary Locke served as the US ambassador to China from 2011 to 2013, and made headlines for being the first Chinese-American in the role.But he still faced criticism from Chinese media, especially when ties were strained - such as when the US embassy in Beijing gave refuge to Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng.State newspaper The Global Times made the point of reminding the public that Mr Locke was just a ""normal"" US politician serving Washington's interests, despite his Chinese ethnicity."
2018-07-31,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180801061320/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45008287,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowClaim: Most major Western European countries would ""only dream"" of having the UK's record on train punctuality and performance.Reality Check verdict: UK passengers are more satisfied with their train service than many of their European neighbours, according to a report from 2013 - although this data is now a little old. But this doesn't necessarily reflect the actual quality of the service. UK trains are similarly punctual to many major Western European countries. They are more heavily used and more expensive, however. Passengers on Northern, covering areas including Manchester, Liverpool and Cumbria, have faced cancelled trains and major delays since a new timetable was introduced in May.Amid the chaos, Robert Nisbet, director of the rail companies' membership body the Rail Delivery Group, told BBC 5 live that the UK's railways were the ""envy"" of Europe.""We're a hugely successful railway in many ways - much more so than many countries in Western Europe who would only dream about having our kind of performance and punctuality records,"" he said.He was referring to a European Commission report, published in 2013, which compared customer satisfaction with rail services across 26 EU countries - excluding Cyprus and Malta which do not have national or regional trains.Looking at overall customer satisfaction with rail services, the UK came second only to Finland.The European Commission's directorate of mobility and transport interviewed 26,034 respondents aged 15 years old or more from different social and demographic groups. They were asked questions about how satisfied they were with things like the punctuality and reliability of services, frequency of trains, stations and facilities on the trains including toilets.Looking only at satisfaction with the punctuality and reliability of trains, the UK did a little worse, coming fourth. But for frequency of trains, it came out top.However, this report - the most recent European comparison available - dates from 2013 and so does not capture any recent disruption, including Northern's cancellations and Southern's recent strike action.Satisfaction ratings also don't necessarily tell you how good a service is in reality.Despite passengers being far more satisfied, more recent research, also from the European Commission, found the punctuality of UK trains was similar to its European neighbours.UK trains were on time about 90% of the time, compared with 91% in France and 93% in Germany - although the countries' definitions of ""on time"" vary. The least punctual trains were in Hungary and Croatia. A far higher proportion of UK trains were cancelled than in Germany or Spain, and a similar proportion were cancelled in France and Italy.  The UK has experienced much greater growth in passenger numbers and reduction in government subsidy than Germany, France or Italy - and costs for passengers have risen faster too. The Rail Delivery Group argues that while the tax-payer picks up more of the cost in those countries, in the UK government funding goes into investment to improve the service.  While the European data provides a useful snapshot, but it is not up-to-date enough to reflect recent changes to rail services.The latest UK data we have comes from independent watchdog Transport Focus and was gathered between 15 January and 28 March 2018  - so it is much more recent, but still does not capture the changes to Northern's services, which began in May. The watchdog's National Rail Passenger Survey found overall satisfaction with train services had slightly declined in the past year, having increased from the year before.But it also revealed massive variation between different train lines, with satisfaction ranging from 69% to 95% across the country. The lowest ratings for overall satisfaction were given to some of the biggest franchises, including Southern, TfL Rail and Great Northern.Northern came 21st out of the 26 companies with an 80% overall satisfaction rate - only above:We don't know how the recent turmoil may have affected these ratings.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

His family are of Jamaican origin.He was brought up by his mother after his father, a lorry driver, left the family - although he went on to rebuild his relationship with his father.Mr Bailey, who is married with two children, worked as a security man at Wembley and London's Trocadero Centre to help finance his way through his time at university.In 2008, Mr Bailey was branded ""future home secretary"" by society magazine Tatler and was subsequently dubbed one of five ""Tatler Tories"" whose parliamentary bids were unsuccessful in 2010. He was elected to the London Assembly in May 2016. He is currently deputy leader of the Conservative Greater London Authority Group.Mr Bailey has cited a Public Enemy Song, ""She Watch Channel Zero?!"", as influential on his decision to enter politics.In 2005, he published a document for the Centre for Policy Studies (of which he remains a research fellow), No Man's Land, in which he criticised liberalism and the state of inner-city neighbourhoods: ""The more liberal we have been, the more our communities have suffered."" He was particularly citing the Ladbroke Grove area of London.In 2006, Mr Bailey helped establish My Generation, where he worked as a youth worker for almost twenty years. The charity aimed to combat drugs, teenage pregnancy and encourage self-help before it was dissolved in 2012.Mr Bailey ran as a parliamentary candidate for Hammersmith, west London, in 2010 - a key marginal seat, but he failed to get elected.He was one of Cameron's 100-strong ""A list"" candidates for the then leader's ""changing faces of the Conservative Party"" campaign. Only 38 of these ended up getting elected in 2010.He's said of David Cameron: ""He's very sharp, and for someone from Eton he has a real understanding.""Mr Bailey also stood in Lewisham West and Penge in the 2017 election, coming second.Following the 2010 general election, he served as a special adviser for David Cameron between 2010 and 2013.He was appointed as the ambassador for David Cameron's big society agenda in 2011, before he was made a special advisor on youth, crime and welfare issues. He also went on to serve in advisory roles in the Cabinet Office and the Department for Education.Mr Bailey has said poor communities ""need a bit more right-wing politics"". He has spoken of his hatred of what he claims is an oversized welfare state in Britain, blaming this ""liberalism"", for the dependency culture he says it has produced among the British black population.Mr Bailey told the Telegraph in 2008 part of his value to the Conservatives is as a ""social translator"", explaining to the middle classes how people on estates think. 2020 Mayoral Pledge: ""My family first came to London in the fifties as part of the Windrush generation.

She has been a British citizen for around ten years, having originally come to the capital to study for her Masters in European Social Policy at the London School of Economics. She's married with one daughter.Ms Morrissey joined the Conservative Party in 2008 and was elected to Ealing Council in 2014. She worked as an actress under the name Joy Boden before entering politics, starring in films such as Geek Mythology (2008), and Only One Can Play (2009).She told Ealing Today: ""After deciding not to go back to work in the film industry after having a child I actually looked at going back to get my PhD in international development but got involved with the local Ealing Conservatives. One thing has led to the other and here we are."" As a councillor, she is the current Conservative policy forum champion for social housing tenants. Since 2016 she has also worked for the Centre for Social Justice.Ms Morrissey was a Conservative parliamentary candidate in the 2017 general election for the Ealing Central and Acton constituency, which at the time was an ultra-marginal seat - Labour had slipped through in the 2015 election with a 274 vote majority.The councillor threatened legal action against the constituency's sitting Labour MP Rupa Huq, and pulled out of hustings for what she described as lies in Labour campaign leaflets (in particular, claims she supported the closure of Ealing Hospital and that she was a ""Hard Brexit Activist""). Ms Huq went on to hold the seat, with a vote increase of about 12%.Ms Morrissey has made the case for ""compassionate"" Conservatism that places social action and initiatives for disadvantaged communities at the heart of policy. She advocates locally-driven initiatives as opposed to state-led intervention.Ms Morrissey also believes Conservative policy on the housing crisis should focus on market-based solutions, and believes cutting ""suffocating red tape"" will give police officers better scope for tackling crime.2020 Mayoral pledge: Ms Morrissey says her campaign will focus around three main issues; tackling London's crime rate, social justice and affordable housing.She told Conservative Home: ""Like a lot of Londoners, I wasn't born here. I moved here as an immigrant and I fell in love with this vibrant city which is now my home and the place I'm raising my family.""I have shared the journey of frustration that many Londoners experience when it comes to trying to get on the housing ladder. Addressing this struggle, that so many face, must be one of our top priorities.""Age: 60Current residence: Barking RiversidePosition on EU: LeaveStance on key policies: Supports legalisation of cannabisKnown for: London Assembly member, bids for mayoral office over the yearsBackground: Mr Boff was born in Hillingdon to a mother who was an NHS worker and local councillor from east London. His father was a policeman from west London. He was active in Conservative Youth branches in the 1970s, founding a branch himself whilst at school.He is the nephew of Roy ""Little Legs"" Smith, who allegedly worked for notorious London gangsters the Kray brothers.A former Hillingdon councillor and European election candidate in the 1990s, Mr Boff, who now works as an IT consultant, will be a familiar face to many Londoners. He ran for the Conservative nomination in 2000, 2004 and 2008 - coming second in both the latter years. He's reportedly described his attempts at the mayoral candidacy as a ""tradition"".He also came second in both attempts to become the mayor of Hackney in 2002 and 2006. Mr Boff ran again for the mayoralty in 2010, coming third.In 2008, Mr Boff was elected to the London Assembly. He was subsequently re-elected in 2012 and 2016. He served as leader of the Conservative Party in the London Assembly from 2012 to 2016.Mr Boff has written and spoken extensively on his libertarian principles. He supports the legalisation of cannabis to end ""the violence and misery brought about by prohibition"". He has also called for a London trial of a ""managed street prostitution area"" as a way to provide better protection for street sex workers.2020 Mayoral pledge: Violent crime, housing and changes to the Hammersmith and City underground line have been identified as key priorities for Boff.He told Conservative Home: ""I want a plan for London that respects this city's different parts, that enhances them rather than just trying to make them the same.""I reject Khan's thinly-veiled war on the suburbs which aims to turn outer London into inner London. I also reject the idea that Central London is some kind of theme park, hostile to people who want to bring up families."""
2018-07-31,Brexit dilemma,https://web.archive.org//web/20180801061320/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44468158,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government has tried hard to reassure EU citizens living in the UK - and Britons abroad - that they will be protected from deportation after Brexit. But many people do not fit neatly into either category, throwing up complex and unexpected dilemmas for both the Home Office and the individuals concerned.Some, such as Ursula Crosby, who contacted the BBC with her story, have been unable to get a clear answer about how to secure residency rights, and citizenship, when Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Ms Crosby retired to Portugal five years ago after 40 years of working as a physiotherapist in NHS hospitals, in London and Shrewsbury. She says she felt like spreading her wings and ""doing something a bit different"" while she could.She is a German citizen but under free movement rules she had the security of knowing she could return to the UK, where her daughter lives and where she still owns property, when she wanted to.Brexit has changed that. The UK has told EU citizens they will be able to apply for ""settled status"" if they have been living in the UK for five years or have been granted indefinite leave to remain. It is unclear how this will apply to Ms Crosby, who was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 1979. Indefinite leave to remain - despite the name - usually expires if you have left the country for two years or more, as is the case with Ms Crosby. She has received conflicting advice from UK officials about whether she would qualify for settled status and no-one has been able to tell her what will happen if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. For all the government's assurances about how easy it will be for EU citizens after Brexit, getting a straight answer on all but the most straightforward of cases is very difficult, if the experience of researching this article is anything to go by.At one point, Ms Crosby was referred to an independent immigration adviser, who told her she would be all right because Britain would probably stay in the European Economic Area after Brexit - which would be news to Prime Minister Theresa May, who has repeatedly ruled that out.She is now torn between selling up and moving back to the UK before Britain leaves the EU in March, or risking moving back at a later date, during the 21-month transition period that will follow Brexit, in the hope that she can still secure settled status.""I am sure I could live in Germany but I wouldn't really want to live in Germany,"" says the 68-year-old. ""I no longer have any connections there, as such. My parents are dead. I have a cousin in Germany. ""I could stay in Portugal but I am not sure I would want to. It was never my intention to and I still have property in England.""If I ask anybody who meets me, they all think I am British.""She first came to the UK in 1971, on a work permit, long before EU free movement rules came into force, and was married to a British man for many years.She now regrets not applying for British citizenship when she had the chance but, like many others, she did not think she needed to.""There are probably quite a lot of people in this situation,"" says immigration lawyer Colin Yeo, ""people that used to live in the UK, perhaps for a very long time, who were assuming they would be able to come back to the UK because it is a member of the EU.""They will probably be all right if they come back during the transition period.""But, he adds, many will feel ""they have got to come back now or they will lose the chance"". Ms Crosby says she can't understand why, as someone in receipt of a full UK state pension, as well as an NHS pension, she may have to wait five years after returning to the UK to qualify for British citizenship, the same as someone from an EU country who has never lived there.""I am an honest person, I have no convictions, I paid my taxes and if I go back I will be able to support myself. Am I doing any harm?"" she says.The Home Office said it did not comment on individual cases, but a spokeswoman said: ""After we leave the EU, in March 2019, there will be an implementation period that ends on 31 December 2020, during which EU citizens and their family members will be free to live, work and study in the UK as they do now. ""EU citizens and their family members who become resident in the UK during the implementation period will be able to make an application to the EU Settlement Scheme and be eligible for temporary leave to remain and, after five years' lawful residence, settled status, under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement. ""The rights of those EU citizens arriving during the implementation period will be safeguarded on the same terms as has been agreed for those EU citizens resident in the UK before we leave the EU.""Ms Crosby remains unconvinced by the Home Office's reassurances - and she has written to the department to try to get some clear guidance on what she should do next.""I am not sure I can rely on the immigration system to relax their very inflexible rules,"" she says.""My worst fear is that I sell up here, move back to England and then find out that it would not have been necessary."""
2018-07-31,Pollwatch: The Chequers effect,https://web.archive.org//web/20180801061320/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44937732,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs are leaving Westminster for the summer recess. What's happened in the opinion polls and what can they tell us about what could happen when Parliament returns in the autumn?Please enable Javascript to view our poll tracker.In the first six months of 2018 the Westminster voting intention opinion polls were rather dull. But since the cabinet awayday at Chequers on 6 July, and the publication of the government's Brexit white paper the following week, there has been a marked change.For months the polls only moved very gradually. Between January and the beginning of July support for Labour dipped a couple of percentage points whilst the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats went up by about one per cent each.That did mean the Tories were fairly reliably in the lead, but only narrowly. Then came Chequers - and the calm of the first half of the year came to an abrupt end.The Conservatives have seen their rating fall back. In a couple of polls they've been at 36%, their lowest level since last year's general election.As a result, Labour has moved ahead in a sequence of polls for the first time since February.The other beneficiaries of the Conservative drop are UKIP. Until Chequers they'd not topped 5% this year. They've been above that in each of the last five published polls.None of this should be exaggerated. The movements aren't massive. But after months where changes happened at a snail's pace, it's a striking development.It could yet turn out that this is just a blip. The absence of warring Conservative MPs from Westminster might see the public's view of the party improve. But if it is a blip, it's a pretty big one.And it potentially foreshadows further turbulence in the autumn when Theresa May and the EU hope to finalise a Brexit deal.To see how difficult the prime minister's task is on Brexit just look at polls about it.Voters remain pretty evenly split about whether it was a good decision.We've seen a continuation of the trend from 2017. Over time, the number of people who say that Brexit was the wrong decision has very gradually increased, but there's no sign of a consensus forming.Worse still for the prime minister, polls which seek to capture what people think should happen next suggest an even more divided public.An interesting poll by new polling firm Deltapoll asked precisely that question: According to this poll, there's no course of action which has the support of even a third of voters. That could cause problems for Theresa May. It's going to be very hard for her to please a majority of the public whatever she does."
2018-07-31,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180801061320/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of those issues - there is yet to be agreement on how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has just agreed how it sees those future relations working and will now be seeing if the EU agrees.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by October on the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.1% in the first three months of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.4%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.2%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 4.2% in the year to March 2018, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. It will end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain-supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.The UK has proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-07-31,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180801061320/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

On the two previous occasions in 1970 and February 1974 the PM and the party lost office. While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position. However, so long as the Conservatives can reach an accommodation with the DUP they will have a working majority in the House of Commons.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed:When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election.Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain.
